- Tomato plants died midsummer 2012. Last year (2011) we lost one tomato plant and pulled it up by the roots and disposed of it. This year on 4 plants the fruit set and then one by one the plants turned brown and had to be destroyed. We got no production this year in 2012. I suspect some kind of fungal disease is present in the soil. Do you have a suggestion?

- mold on outside of home-canned tomato jars. My mother has some home canned tomatoes (canned in 2009) that ended up with mold on the outside of the jar. The mold occurred after she had a basement leak she did not know she had (in 2011). She wiped the mold from the jars with no regrowth of that mold on the jars. She is hesitant to use them but hates the thought of throwing them out. What should she do? Is there anything she can do to reassure herself?

- Tomato Problem. Ten years ago when I planted a large garden, with 8 tomato plants, all of my tomato plants died except the cherry tomatos.They reached a height of about two feet then all of them withered and died. An AG agent came out and told me that she suspected that there was a fungus in the gorund that caused this and it was irreversible. I want to start again. I have a broad spectrum fungicide (chlorothalonil) that I would like to spray on the field before prep and planting. Is this a good idea or a waste of time? Since this stuff is toxic I don't want to use it unless it is worth the effort. This area has been fallow for 8 years.

- Possible Fungus Problem on Tomato Plants. In the spring of 2011, I planted tomato plants in the ground inside my tomato cage. I have been planting in this area for several years. It is clay soil augmented with humus and top soil, and covered with landscape fabric to keep out the weeds. I used a little bit of fertilizer but not much. The area gets about 6-8 hours of sunlight daily. They all were doing quite well until the summer, and then the stems and leaves suddenly started turning brown and dried up. Then the whole plant died. It wasn't for the lack of water, because I watered them every other day during the hot, dry spells. My brother told me it was fungus in the soil that causes the plants to turn brown. Is this true? If so, what kind of fungus would do that and how do you get rid of it? If not fungus, then what would cause a plant to do that? Do you know of any fungus problems in Calvert County for 2011?  Sorry, I don't have any photos since this was two years ago

- Cherry Tomato Plants with Leaf Damage. I just spoke with a very nice consultant about worrying developments with 3 varieties of cherry tomatoes that I started in March - black cherry, sungold and gold nugget.  The problem is sort of brown-gray-purple stippling on some of the older leaves which are curling upward; new growth is presently unaffected. I have been hardening off the seedlings this week, but putting them at dusk under a plastic coldframe on my black asphalt driveway, since it has been cold at night.  My full sized tomatoes have not been affected.  And by the way this has been the toughest year for me in some two decades of starting seeds, maybe because the basement room where I start them is less heated than the upstairs.  Any thoughts?  BTW - I LOVE the HGIC website and especially Grow It! Eat It! which I refer to at least daily at this time of the year.  Robin Ritterhoff Montgomery County master Gardener (2012

- Mysterious Tomato Disease. This year my tomato plants have a mysterious wilt. Occurring in plants I started as seed and plants that I purchased from retail. The plants start wilting and appear to die but do not turn brown. The color in them fades some but do not turn brown. Branches on some of the plants are deformed and resemble a knarled fist. The wilt starts out by new leaves curling up tightly.I planted new tomato plants at far end of garden and they are doing the same wilting. I have treated plants with liquid Sevin for possible  insects such as aphids.Ialso treatedwith Neem oil In case there were mites or some unseen fungus.Considered bacterial wilt but cut stems don't display the white oozing stuff that is supposed to come out of the stems when placed in water.

- Tomato Hornworms. Hello,I have 2 large container tomato plants growing with a ton of tomatoes and blossoms on them. Recently, I noticed a small, green caterpillar on there with a spike on it, so I assume it is a hornworm. I picked it off and saved it for id purposes. Is there anything I can to do to get rid of them? How destructive are they? I know that wasps lay eggs in them to proliferate, but this one was egg-less.Also, lots of large "green" tomatoes, but none have ripened yet. Is this unusual? They get plenty of sun, but I understand that darkness (wrapping in newspaper, can release gasses and reipen them faster inside).Thanks!Gary B. Elliot

- Tomato and pepper problems. This is the second consecutive year on this problem. A homeowner on the Shoshone River south of Powell has had an extensive garden for many years. Last summer, selected plants in the garden showed what appeared to be herbicide damage, with the worst symptoms on tomato and pepper plants. A nearby ditch had been sprayed with a mix of chemicals, and it was decided that drift from that application was the culprit. This year, the garden is showing symptoms again, but no spraying was done in the vicinity, and a neighbor's garden is also symptomatic. While ditch water is used to irrigate when it is available, there are times when well water is used to sprinkle-irrigate both gardens. The gardener also indicated that plants started in the house showed symptoms prior to being planted it the garden. Some of the tomato plants were stared by the gardener, and some were purchased plants. Both sources showed symptoms. I can't help but think it is a water issue, but am looking for someone with similar experience and an idea of where and how to confirm the water is the issue. Given the area, I would not know where to start on asking for chemicals or contaminants to test for, so any suggestions are appreciated

- My cucumber and tomato plants are dying. First, about a month ago, the cucmber plant that was in the same bed as my tomatoes wilted up and died. I thought it was cucumber beetles, so I used diatomaceous earth on the cucumber plant that was in the other bed. It perked back up and did fine until last week when it wilted and is now mostly dead. Also, about a month ago one of the Early Girl tomato plants started getting yellow leaves on the north side of the plant. Then the fruit starting getting weird yellow-ish splotches on it, and I also noticed it had bottom rot on a lot of the fruit. The plant still has some green, but the yellow has spread up the plant and there are brown leaves at the top now too. The Celebrity and Roma plants in the same bed are now getting yellow on the north side of the plant on the bottom too. I have a terrible time with Flea Beetles.

Can you tell me if this is a "safe" recipe? I know that canning tomatoes is touchy, and that I need to take special care to ensure that it is processed safely. I really like the idea of being able to can spaghetti sauce for later use, I have a garden full of tomatoes!  If this recipe is not appropriate, can you provide one that would be? I would like to be able to have the vegetables they list, like carrots, onions etc, and the mushrooms in the sauce. I only have a water bath option, I do not have a pressure canner.   Thank you for much for your help!  Annett

- Gray spots on tomatoes. I have a German Gold tomato plant that is producing plenty of fruit, but about 1/2 of each fruit is discolored and of a different texture- some of the lesions are harder and some softer and squishy. They are also grey-brown in color, with occasional thin, brown streaks. There are also brownish "veins" in the wall of the tomatoes, kind of like what you see in overripe avocados. The normal half of the fruit tastes alright, but I have not wanted to try the affected parts. The plants themselves look pretty normal, with little to no leaf spotting. We've had an odd summer in Minnesota, with spells of extremes of hot and cool weather- abundant rain until about 3-4 weeks ago.

- Why do tomatoes have hard white and green centers? The early bearing variety tomatoes we planted this year has fruit that looks mature and ripe but have hard, green centers and in the edges of the top half of the tomato that is not palatable.  The bottom 1/3 of the fruit is usable for canning juice, but off taste and not ideal by any means for what we want. We have observed this very occasionally in red mature ripe looking fruit in previous years, but this year it is present on the all the fruit of the early plants, and a few of the later fruits, much more than is normal for us.  We recognize this has been another season of cool, wet-early and hot dry-late weather.  We water regularly, same as we did in previous years, late in the evening, for longer periods 2 to 3 times a week.  We treat with a fungicide a couple times when first signs of blight appear.  We have about 2000 sq ft of garden space, raise about 30 - 40 plants of early, mid, and late-large, all indeterminate variety of tomatoes, with the majority of early varieties as our preference.  We rotate our tomato plants seasonally, as we have severe late season blight to manage. (We have talked at length  with Isanti County Master Gardeners about this issue.)  Any thoughts about what we can do in the future to avoid this, short of asking for ideal growing conditions?  Are we watering too much? Why is this year so bad and affecting virtually all the early variety plants

- My Old German tomato plan... My Old German tomato plant is huge, but almost every tomato has teeny white dots all over it.  Plus, some have scabs/holes.  The plant looks healthy overall, but I did find some spotted leaves, which I pulled (took a picture of these several hours after pulling so they look pretty wilty in the pic), probably about 20 bad leaves off a huge plant.  Note: I have some really good pics but it looks like I can only attach one, right?  I've had japanese beetles on my raspberries and sweet potato (and killed them and haven't gotten hardly any since)...do they go on tomatoes, because I don't think so.  I have seen really tiny black specks of a bug on the Old German...are those aphids?  Do they do anything?  When I see them, they look dead.  I water at ground level daily to not splash, and to keep moisture consistent. The multitude of dots on the Old German tomatoes almost makes me think maybe that's from overwatering...could that be it?  I can believe scabs are bacteria, but these dots are pretty miniscule.  Really no clue here.  I also have a grape tomato plant and bell pepper with spots/holes, but I will post a message for each separately.  Thanks in advance for any help/suggestions you can provide.

I thought that I'd damaged them as there was little consistency in growth and a few leaves had fallen off.  Then, about two days ago, I noticed light spots on the leaves. A slight movement of the tray can cause affected leaves to fall off.What is this, can it be fixed, are my other plants---what were to be the scions--likely to have this problem? Any help would be much appreciated.m

- Which type of tomato can be grown in a container? I posted this Sunday, and when I heard nothing back, I looked at my question. I didn't realize that I should have marked my question, "Make it Public." I am reposting it. Thank you.Good afternoon!  Today I purchased three Bonnie Plants tomato plants.  They are healthy looking.  The three I got are three I have never had or seen before (which is one reason I got them).  On the display of plants, it stated that one of the tomato plant work well in a pot (I don't remember which one and the information stake in the pot doesn't state it).  Could you please tell me which of the three can be grown in a 12 inch pot?      I bought Goliath, Heinz (a Heirloom tomato) and Mortgage Lifter.  Hopefully, I didn't put back the one that said it would work well in a pot and that it is one of those.  I am so excited to get them in the ground and pot.    Thank you so much!  Pa

The bottom parts look fine and the plants are evenly green with no spots or visible bugs.  One plant has four tomatoes on it, three of which are golf ball size.  We have noticed that the wilting leaves are curling up AND the leaves are splitting down the middle through the vein.  We have shown them to two nurseries and they are baffled.  We don't know whether to pull them up and start over or what.  Any advise will be greatly appreciated.  I feel like time is running out.  Thank

- Wilting diseases on tomatoes and raspberries. I have tomatoes, raspberries, and potatoes in my garden that I think are all affected by some type of virus/fungal disease.  Raspberries have yellow leaves starting at the bottom on last year's fruiting canes, eventually spreads up the plant until the canes die. I had been able to keep somewhat under control till this year. So bad this year that I just cut out all fruiting canes.  Tomatoes (not virus resistant types) are planted where I grew some last year. Plants start to wilt at the tops, recover in evening, then repeat, appearing weaker each time. This is the first time I've noticed this problem. I planted new potatoes in the spring. Had healthy looking plants until a month or so ago, then foliage started to turn yellow, wither and die.  I've tried to do some research, but it's hard to figure out if this is all the same problem, or variations. I garden organically, so if the solution is chemical I don't want to use it. I have read that if it's Fusarium or Verticillium wilt, it can persist in the soil for years. I have read of one method of reducing virus in soil, which is to till top six inches then cover with black plastic for the rest of the summer to raise soil temp to try to burn it out.  Any general advice for this complicated mess, other than giving up gardening for next five years

I use grass clippings around the garden and up to the plants to keep the weeds at bay.  Every week I hand pick any weeds that are poking thru.  My husband says he has not treated this grass with any chemicals.  I purchased these plants from 4 locations: Lowe's, Old Country Gardens, Friendly Gift Shop and Richardson's.  Some plants from each location are affected.  The 3 supersonics are the only ones I transplanted before putting them in my garden.  They were the smallest plants I purchased.  The only plants that are not affected are the ones in the rear row of my garden.  I have 5 rows of tomato plants and each row is 3 plants deep.  These rear plants are doing the best.  They are Sweet 100, Husky Cherry Red and Amish Paste.  Any suggestions for what might be going on and should I leave them or pull them?  Thanks for any help you may offer.  An

- Grafted Tomatoes a Flop!! Hello, I planted 3 different varieties of these in the same raised bed as two regular tomato plants, and the grafted ones have grown VERY little since planting (early June); the others are going like gangbusters.  The nursery told me to be sure not to plant the grafted ones deep, to plant them so that the graft is above the soil level, which I did.  They all got the same lime and fertilizer at planting and are getting the same sun and water.  See my picture for the sadness!!!  What did I do wrong?  Should I return them to the nursery?  They were so expensive and what a waste

We cover the ground with 6 layers of newspapers, then 4-6" of grass clippings(not treated) for mulch and never water them overhead. We rotate where we plant them every year. They get about 8 hrs.of sun daily and plenty of circulation. We always clean up fallen debris.  I don't know how else to prevent this.  We even tried covering the soil with black plastic for a month one time, but that didn't help either.  We don't have any other area that gets enough sun so I can't move the garden.

- is it late blight or septoria on my tomatoes? I called the MSUE hotline and discussed the condition that is affecting my tomatoes but after looking at the pictures and thinking further about the questions perhaps I wasn't keying on the correct signs to distinguish Late Blight from Septoria. the three pictures attached show the spots that have and are appearing on my tomato plants. They have bloomed and produced fruit as you can see. The condition seems to affect my Romas and Early Girls more than the Beefsteaks but those too are now showing signs as in the photos. But perhaps at this point the distinction is more academic as the treatment seems to be pretty similar?

I staked the tomatoes and placed landscape fabric and wood chips around the entire 10' x 18' raised garden. I planted Roma, Celebrity, Early Girl and Supersweet 100. The leaves got a blight on them and started at the bottom of the plant and slowly worked its way up. I did get some tomatoes but why the dying leaves for a second season on the dirt? It was hauled in from a landscaping company. I applied "Garden safe Fungicide 3" almost every week yet the blight still came. I was careful to remove the leaves and spoiled fruit as soon as they appeared to be bad.  I have three raised garden plots that I rotate my crops in each season. One problem that I cannot control is overhead irrigation on a timer. Does the water spread the disease badly?

RICH TOMATO COMPOTE (Yield:  9 oz.)  source: Food.com  Ingredients: .  3  tablespoons olive oil    1   onion, finely chopped    2  cloves garlic, finely chopped    2  slices  dried orange zest (see note)    2  tablespoons  balsamic vinegar    21  ounces tomatoes, roughly chopped    1  teaspoon tomato paste    1  tablespoon light muscovado sugar (optional)     salt &amp; fresh ground pepper, to taste       Directions: Note: To dry orange zest, heat oven to 110*C.  Remove zest from oranges with a vegetable peeler and dry in a single layer, on a nonstick baking tray for up to 6 hours, until dry enough to snap in your fingers.  Heat the oil in a pan.  Toss in the onion, garlic and orange zest.  Fry in the oil until the onion is soft, but not coloured.  Add the balsamic vinegar and stir until it is completely evaporated.  Tip the tomatoes and tomato paste into the pan and cook over a medium heat for about 10 to 15 minutes, or until the compote is as thick as you want it.  Remove and discard the orange zest.  Season with salt and pepper if you like, plus the muscovado sugar to taste.  This keeps in the fridge for up to three days or in the freezer for up to 6 months

- Canning tomatoes that have ripened indoors. I have about ten pounds of roma tomatoes that have ripened indoors. My other tomato vines started withering several weeks ago and I wanted to save what was left of the romas. The vines were healthy when I picked them, and the tomatoes were full sized. However, they were very green at the time.Most of them have turned red, but are still firm to the touch. I would like to be able to process and can them in pint or quart jars, but I'm concerned about canning tomatoes that are not fresh off the vine. I know that tomatoes are "border" fruits, and so I always add lemon juice (5% acidity) to each jar (1 tbs for pints / 2 tbs for quarts). I also use a pressure canner for processing tomatoes (with the exception of salsa, which contains plenty of vinegar for flavor and acidity to discourage bacterial growth).Since I don't have enough tomatoes to make pasta sauce, I'd like to can them peeled and whole. Is there still a chance to can these tomatoes, or should I freeze them to preserve them

I plan to use a mixture of compost and regular garden soil vs. using just potting soil last year. Also, I am planting a Rutgers tomato. Any suggestions or advice would be greatly appreciated. I will be growing this plant in Ocean City if that makes any difference. Thank you

Used Osmocote in the planting and have applied water soluble fertilizer twice. The plants are taller than I am and are growing out of their cages.....very healthy looking, but VERY FEW blooms have appeared. Will it help to promote blooms if I cut back some of the branches? I've never done that before, but if it will encourage a tomato crop I'm willing to try. Thank you for any advice you can send my way......San Antonio, Texas.

- Early blight on tomatoes. Over the past several years, I've had an increasing problem with what seems to be early blight on tomatoes in my backyard garden.  I have no choice but to plant in the small gardens that get enough sun and are protected from deer with black plastic netting.  I work the soil carefully each spring, so that it's rich in nutrients and the plants grow very well.  But they slowly die back, dropping leaves and stems from the ground up with what seems to be the typical early blight coloration.  What can I do? Are there early-blight resistant varieties available in Montgomery County?  Which ones do you recommend?  (I usually plant mostly cherry tomatoes.) What fungicide(s) should I use?

When they were ready, I transplanted them into 5" solo plastic cups with sterilized organic potting mix. Now they are from 4" to 12" tall.

This year I planted about 300ea heirloom tomato seeds in clean, washed trays in sterilized organic potting mix.

- What's eating the tomatoes? Holes in leaves of tomatoes and peppers - photos attached of front and back of leaf. Tomato seedlings (different varieties) were planted in a bed about two weeks ago. Damage was noticed this week, affecting most of the 10 plants, plus several of the bell pepper plants. We don't have the same problem with the squash and cucumbers. We didn't mulch the bed yet so there is a lot of mud splash on the bottom of the leaves -- when I checked for insects on the bottom of the leaves it was inconclusive. Perhaps a few small brown insects -- perhaps it was just pieces of dirt/mud.  Large bed is in full sun. Watered by hand. Soil was taken from an area that used to be a barnyard many years ago, added on top of regular yard soil -- it's in New Midway so heavy red (clay?) soil -- tilled together. In addition, some dry but not composted cow manure was added and tilled it before planting. It's my brother's veggie bed and he wants to dust with Sevin. I'm wondering if there is a less drastic/toxic way to solve his problem

- Blight on young tomato and pepper leaves. I started 3 kinds of tomatoes and 2 kinds of peppers from seed using Ferry Morse seeds. The plants were a beautiful green until I put them outside last week to condition them for planting. I brought them inside the evening of the frost warning. After a few days outside the tomatoesstarted to become pale. Thinking they may be pot bound in their 3 inch containers I planted them on Saturday, May 23. Today, May 25, I realized the leaves now have pale pink spots on them. The pepper leavesare also affected. Looking up pictures of blight on young tomatoes on the internet I'm wondering if they have a fungus. I also read fungus spores can stay in the soil over the winter to attack your plants the following year. I dug a few plants up, removed them, and intended to burn them, then I decided to check with you before I continue.

- Tomato Blight. Hi, I recently planted my garden but unfortunately I'm seeing sickening spots on the leaves and stems of my plants. Please see the attached image for visual evidence. One plant also has this disease on its stem, and I fear it will spread throughout my entire garden. I also noticed white spots on some leaves, but I don't know if that was sun scalding or the first stages of this disease.  I didn't realize how diseases and pathogens could exist throughout the winter in weeds and such and, unfortunately, didn't properly clean up my garden last year. It also seems that the two plants I bought from Hillside are the worst affected and also the ones that first suffered symptoms so I fear that may be another possible cause. I'm considering just ripping out that plant to try to save the rest of the garden.  The plants are also likely not spaced far enough, as their leaves are touching. I gave them the recommended 18 or 24" (I forget which one) spacing but it just wasn't enough.  Could you please advise?

- Effect of Black Dyed Wood Mulch on Tomato Plants? After more that 40 years of my growing tomatoes without mulch, my wife insisted on adding black dyed mulch around each tomato plant bought at a nursery. Initially the development of the leaves on the plants looked normal. Now the new leaves developing as the plants increase in size are curling up on the edges. The 2 varieties planted are Better Boy and Early Girl, blight resistant according to catalog information. We have had great success with these varieties in past years without the use of any mulch. My wife is a devotee of mulch.  Can it be that the mulch is having an adverse effect on the plants? Does necessary repeated watering by rain or garden hose increasingly leach toxic chemicals into the soil to the point of killing of the plants? I do not know if the wood is from chemically treated shipping pallets because the mulch was applied by a landscaping company.

About 10 days ago, I installed a clear polycarbonate roof, said to have UV protection, 7 feet above them for hail protection. There are no walls and air circulation seems good. They're fed three times per day with nutrient I've used successfully in the past and the plants are growing well. Because last year's crop may have had late blight I did not re-use the perlite and I cleaned all buckets and tools with bleach.It has rained almost every day this year -- I haven't used my lawn sprinkler yet -- and the plants have been kept wet by the rains. This has kept the nutrients diluted to some extent so I expect that excess nutrient problems will not be an issue.I've included a picture of both top and bottom of the leaves. I hope that you can tell me that I'll have tomatoes this year.Thanks for your time and help.

- Brown dots on pots and fungal issues on tomato pepper and watermelon. I attached a few pictures of some issues I'm having in my garden.  I use smart pots and raised beds.  The smart pots are made of black cloth to allow roots to breathe.  I have some brown spots growing on them (please see attached picture).  I am assuming it's some type of mold.    Also, there is some lightening/yellowing of the leaves on my zucchini and watermelon.  Is this a nutrient deficiency?  If so, how do I address it?  The weather has been hot and wet, and the wood chips keep things very moist.    Lastly, why are my tomato plant leaves curling?  See pictures.  I'm in Brandywine, Maryland.

I'm in Lakewood and we have gotten nearly daily rain, and I've not had to do much, if any watering.The youngest stems and leaves to the top of the plant (it's about 3 ft tall) are curling, and wilting, and to the eye appear dried out, but they are not dry. or brittle. The rest of the plant is still green, but again, wilted and drooping. It started setting fruit, and they seem stunted at about a nickel size. The plant next to it looks beautiful, and a total contrast to this plant. It's main stalk looks shriveled, for lack of a better word... It has deep grooves rather than a plump thick stalk.

I know the last few summers have been exceptionally wet, but I wonder if these tomatoes are ok to eat? I first planted Roma in the backyard garden in 1990.  We used to get good sun most of the day - from around 10am to 4 pm.  But the garden now gets less sun b/c large oaks shade it until around 12 noon everyday.  So now it only gets sun around 3-4 hrs a day.  Or, maybe I have something in the soil that's causing this?  So, 2 questions:  1. Should I even be trying to grow tomatoes with a garden with such limited full sun? 2. Are these tomatoes with spots ok to eat?  That is, do the spots that look like mold penetrate the whole fruit to make the whole tomato unsafe to eat? Thank you

The other half rot or fall off before ripening.  The top of the plant stays healthy and green longer, producing buds and fruit, but the same thing happens to this fruit.  The location does not get a full 6 hours of sun per day, but from what I have read, this is not a response to lack of sun.  This is the 3rd year in a row I have had this problem.  I do use liquid fertilizer occasionally, and water properly.  What am I doing wrong?  Thanks

- Tomato Disease. I watched the webinar on tomato diseases and am still a bit stumped on this one. This does not seem to be progressing from bottom leaves upward. There also doesn't seem to be fuzzy areas beneath lesions on leaves. What is odd about this is how the branches are splitting away from the plant at the point where they meet the stem.  Please see attached photo. There are several photos but I could only attach one. I have been removing diseased foliage as it develops which seems to slow the progression. Thoughts

- Use of fesh stewed rather than canned tomatoes. Hello,  is it possible to use fresh or freshly stewed tomatoes in this recipe rather than the can of diced tomatoes?

- Tomato Disease? We have a yellow jubilee heirloom tomato plant. It's our first time growing a tomato. We are seeing dark spots on the leaf, stem, and tomatoes themselves. Some of the spots have a yellow edging. What disease is this? Is it early blight? I have thought about spraying the plant, but not sure for what. If I spray for fungus I thought either a copper or sulfur based organic spray, but would like to use the least toxic spray, even if it is organic. I am not concerned about staying organic and understand that organic doesn't equal the safest. I want somthing that when sprayed will have a short half life inside the fruit.  What suggestions would you have for treating as we have a number of tomatoes with these black spots. I assume if spotted these should be discarded and not eaten.

- Two Questions:  Yukon Gold Potatoes and Transplanting Tomato Seedlings. I planted Black Krim and Striped Roma tomato seeds in late April.  Both are at least 6 to 8 inches tall.  I had more than one seedling in each peat cup; I transplanted the peat cup contents into a larger pot after the true leaves and began to harden off gradually.   A couple of weeks ago, I successfully separated the Black Krims and planted them.  On the other hand, I tried separating one pot of striped Romas with three in the pot and am struggling to keep them alive; all are extremely droopy, especially the one I left in the original pot.  Last week, I planted one in the ground, another in a huge pot (I did this before with this variety with great success) and left one in the pot.  I made tent covers to protect them from the strong sun. I'm struggling with the first two and the one in the pot which took the peat cup contents is the most droopy.  I separated the ones in the second pot of striped Romas, but have not transplanted them into their final space (pot or ground), because they got so droopy and only seemed to recover when inside. I've left them inside since Saturday and they look pretty good.  Question:  How much longer should I leave them inside, or should I try to harden them off again by taking them outside gradually for a second time.    Next question:  I planted some Yukon Gold potatoes on April 22.  I've dug a few (good size), but the skins were thin, so I waited a week.  Last week when I dug a few more, the skins were thicker and seemed more appropriate for storage; however, when I cut them I saw a ring of brown spots that seemed to penetrate through.  I cut the section with the spots off.  Any suggestions?  Are those spots harmful?  Thanks very much

- disease resistant tomatoes. This is the first year I planted tomatoes.  I grew them from seed, both Roma and Beefsteak varieties.  The seedlings were very strong and healthy, they did really well for a long time and I had many blossoms and fruit.  Within the past few weeks the whole plant is spotted and wilted and some of the fruit has black spots on the bottom and sides.  I know now that I planted them too close together, but was wondering if there would be a good variety to plant in Minnesota that is more disease resistant?    The garden is  a raised bed, and gets plenty of sunshine.  The beans are doing well, and the basil and peppers are healthy too.

- Tomatoes Ripening on only One Side. I have six indeterminate tomato plants (beefsteak, early girl, better boy, and Cherokee purple) in a raised bed (6 feet by 8 feet by 2 feet high) in a sunny location. The beds have very good quality soil with lots of compost. The tomato plants have been producing nice fruit since around the Fourth of July.  On a couple of occasions I have noticed tomatoes that ripened completely- even beautifully- on one side, while remaining green on one part or even on the entire other half of the tomato.  (See attached photo of 2 tomatoes.)  I always believed that direct exposure to sunlight was actually not really a factor in ripening (e.g., I thought too much heat inhibited lycopene formation and some of my reddest tomatoes have grown under a thick shaded canopy of vines).  Am I wrong? Can you tell me what would cause a tomato to half-ripen?  Thanks!

- tomato blight in garden box. I have 4 garden boxes (4x4ft each) on the ground where the sod has been removed in a sunny spot in the back yard. Two years ago I had beautiful tomatoes. Last year I planted the tomatoes  (VFN resistant varieties) in a nearby box (to avoid planting tomatoes in the same location in consecutive years) and they got  a bad case of tomato blight.

Or just plant something else where the tomatoes were and move the tomatoes back to the box they were in previously when they didn't have blight.   One more thing - what is your recommendation for preparing the soil in the spring for the boxes that didn't have blight? Add compost, add packaged composted soil or something else?

- Grafting tomatoes. I started grafting tomatoes several years ago and had the process nailed down. I got close to 75% yield the first year that I tried my hands at grafting. My yield went down significantly last year. It was close to ~25%. Most of the plants died due to damping off and my guess is that I didn't do a good enough job of disinfecting the razor blades and grafting clips. So, this year, I disinfected everything with 70% isopropyl alcohol and I also applied chamomile tea and a dilute copper solution to the soil. Unfortunately, my yield this year was 0% as none of the 12 plants made it. In all cases, the scion got limp within 2-4 days after graft and fell over. This happened while the plants were still in complete darkness and high humidity environment. The only difference that I can think of from previous years is that I didn't dry the grafting clips and they were soaking with alcohol when I put them on the scion/rootstock. Is it possible that the alcohol entered the wound and killed the plant? If not, what else could have caused this year's disastrous results?

- Septoria leaf spot resistant tomato variety? Every year for the last several years our tomatoes have been bedeviled with septoria leaf spot.  When septoria leaf spot took hold in the garden about 10 years ago, we tried increasingly stringent cultural practices -- covered the ground in black plastic, mulched, watered from below, and treated with Daconil.  All of these slowed it down but only enough to get a partial crop.  We tried another location about 50 feet away from the garden with the same result; last year we tried growing them in pots on the ground in the garden area, and they were infected.  We even tried a potted plant on the patio over 100 feet away from the garden.  We've tried a grafted variety (Mighty Matoes, I think), Black Krim, and a number of others advertised as being disease resistant.  We keep trying every year, not because we're masochists but because we like growing and eating them.  Can you give us any hope of a variety that is resistant to this problem?  Thanks.

We are growing heirloom tomatoes and planning to have them climb up a wire. We'll be using tomato clips to support the main stem.  For many years we've been pruning tomatoes differently than most of the advice I see online. I'm attaching a photo of a plant in our garden. Rather than cutting off the "sucker" that comes out at a 45 angle between the stem and the branch, we have been cutting off the branch but leaving the first two leaves on that branch. It is always seemed to work well but we would like your advice. Is there a problem with the way we have been doing it?  Thanks

- what's wrong with my tomato plants? The variety is heirloom yellow pear. I started them indoors, then put them in pots and brought them outside about 2 weeks ago. I saw one with spots, and I didn't think anything of it until tonight when I went out to take a closer look at the plants and realized that all 5 of them had spots to a varying degree. The spots aren't raised, and for the most part they don't go all the way through. They're not dusty and I can't rub them off. The new growth has only a few spots and are deep green. I used Miracle Gro when I repotted them. I did fertilize them last week. I don't know if it's a virus or a deficiency. I'm not really finding anything that matches what the leaves look like. Help

- Top of tomato plants wilting -- quick onset! A couple of days ago, my tomato plants starting wilting from the top. They are seemingly healthy one day, then severely wilted the next -- with the top being impacted first. There is no indication that the plants are sick before they wilt -- no spotting or color change. They are nice and dark and green, and drooping. (Photos attached)I removed the first two affected plants, hoping that whatever blight or bug was causing the problem would be removed as well. No luck, through. Two more plants started wilting today -- since morning watering.When I removed the dying plants, their roots still seemed firmly in the ground. The garden is surrounded by lawn - not high weeds. There is a walnut tree in the area, but the garden is well beyond the drip line. A few leaves might have gotten tilled in last fall, but very few. I've been watering them every day -- it's been fairly warm and dry. The soil had pretty good drainage.Any suggestions would be very much appreciated. I've lost four plants in two days and at this rate, I'll lose them all.DeanThe attached photos show 1) one entire plant, showing that the top is wilted and the bottom leaves look much better. Also, there is no discoloration or spotting, and 2) a close up of lower leaves shows that some leaves look OK, while leaves from the branch above are severely wilted.

- Tomato problems. I have two separate issues. One is a leaf curl issue, which occurred last year as well. Both years we have had a long, cool spring, with nights in the 40's. The plant looks droopy, but actually is not limp. Lots of blossoms, but the fruit ends up deformed. This seems to be affecting all four tomato plants to some extent. (Four different varieties, some worse than others.)The second issue appears to be insect related. This is only on the Early Girl plant, which is also the least affected by the leaf curl.To clarify.....Last year when we had the leaf curl issue, we had just moved into the new home, and the tomatoes were planted in large pots, which I attributed the problem to. Subsequently we have had a major landscaping project completed, which includes two raised planting beds with new soil. So they are in totally different conditions this year, other than being in the same area of the yard.I am attaching pictures that I hope help. Thank you!

- Tomato Leaf Curl. Hi.I have been trying to figure out what is causing my tomato plants leaves to curl. I have 6 plants and only two are doing OK. From looking at Youtube videos it looks more like herbicide damage than anything else, but the lower leaves are drying out and dying as well.I amended my soil with an organic Ecogrow compost. After a few weeks the leaves were looking a little yellow so I added a tomato/nitrogen fertilizer from Happy Frog. Could I have over dosed them? Could it be herbicide spray drift from a neighbor? I live in town in Boulder.I have attached some photos. All images are from the same plant.Thanks in advance. Ken Bernstein

- Best varieties for tomatoes. I'm struggling with tomatoes, are there better varieties for yield or is determinate a better option than indeterminate? I make sauce, paste, stewed, and on a good year salsa but seldom do I get enough yield in my home garden.  I prefer romas for the better yield in sauce and have been growing San Marzanos. The first year I had 6 plants and my yield was around 20 pounds which seems really low. I've since increased to 12 plants and my yield last year was barely 40. This seems insane when I look at the plants photographed by local farms to announce their tomatoes will be ready soon that I feel i may need to try a new type of paste tomato that will give me some better yield but the variety i grow should be excellent in this zone so I'm not sure where to go from her

As I was removing them I realized that only the 'runners' were affected, and not the 'producer' stems.

Hello-  This program is great, you provided excellent advise on serviceberry rust... previously  I have a new raised bed that is part sun, PM full sun and over a mostly clay soil.

- Outer tomato foliage turning grey and yellow. Hello Master Gardeners!  I'm growing tomatoes in Earth Boxes (bins with water reservoirs) on my deck.  Overall, the plants are doing fantastic (see IMG_0900.JPG); they're big and have already produced lots and lots of fruit.  However, a few weeks ago, well after fruit production began, much of the outer smaller foliage started turning a bit grey and then yellow (see IMG_0901.JPG).  I tore some leaves off to take a clearer picture (see IMG_0888.JPG).  The problem occurred on 7 different plants of 3 types (sun golds, marglobes, and super sweet 100's).  The same problem occurred for the 1 of 7 plants that was in a normal pot, rather than an Earth Box.  I thought it might just be a nutrient deficiency.  Last year my plants started dying in mid-August.  They took off again after re-fertilizing and continued producing basically until winter.  So I re-fertilized all of the current plants with 5-10-10 tomato feed.  But I'm not sure I've corrected the problem.  New growth has been limited.  The existing fruit continues to do well, but I haven't seen any new flowers for quite some time (2-3 weeks perhaps).  I fill up the water reservoir daily and occasionally use a blossom-end-rot spray.  Old yellow foliage is occasionally pruned to encourage new growth.  The plants are located to receive full sun all day long.  Any idea what's causing the foliage to become discolored?  Thanks,      Joh

This plant is currently bearing lots of fruit towards the middle and top of the plant. But the bottom half is lacking any fruit and the leaves are turning light yellow. The other 3 tomato plants (Early Girl, Forth of July and Early Girl Bush varieties) do not show yellow leaves and are also bearing good fruit. All 4 of these tomato plants are in separate large containers, with potting soil mixed with compost, and with mulch on top. I water them deeply every other day or so.

- Can I get tomatoes in the fall from my spring indeterminate plants or should I plant new plants? Hello, I live in north Harris County. I grew a good crop this spring of tomatoes from several indeterminate plants (Better Boy variety). They stopped producing with the heat of the summer. They have continued to grow and now are a little out of control. From the beginning, I staked each plant on 7 foot tall 2x2 inch poles. They have grown taller than the stakes and are now growing on an adjacent trelise. My question is: if I want to try to get a crop of tomatoes in the fall, would you suggest that I trim them back and try to get them to produce in the fall or plant new plants? If you think that I have a chance at getting these plants to produce, how would you suggest that I pruning the plants? Do I prune a little at a time so that they don't go into shock?

Also, if you advise that I plant new plants to get tomatoes in the fall, what variety would you suggest planting and when would you suggest planting them? Thanks so much

Some are close to ripe, but many are still quite immature.  With temperatures falling below 50 degrees last night, and sustained below 70 degrees yesterday and today, and given that I did not cover the plants.  The only thing perhaps going for me is that the plants are in a raised garden, with some protective arborvitae windscreen cover from the east and south.  Is it likely the unripened fruit has "chill damage" and won't ripen?   Should I bring all the fruit inside to see if I can ripen in a paper bag in a cool location?

The only one I found had peppers and celery, and I would like a recipe that didn't have those, and is simply tomatoes, garlic, and herbs, maybe onion. I would like one for a water bath recipe, but if you had one for a refrigerator version I'd take both!Also, can you use frozen tomatoes in canning? I've been freezing my ripe cherry tomatoes as I've been harvesting them and didn't know if I could. Thank you!

- Pik rite tomatos. I have been raising pik rite tomatoes for years with great success.  I don't think I have had any of them show the white fibrous texture in the top of the tomato like they are doing this year.  The tomato looks beautiful, but when you slice the top off, they have a fibrous white look underneath.  Some of them really have a lot of this texture while some of them show none of it.  We have always planted in the same area, while trying to plant on one side of the garden and then the next year on the other side.  The garden is a rectangle 40' x 70 '. So they are always pretty close to the same area.  Could it be because of a blight?  Or by being planted too close year after year

- Tomato stem end showing black instead of white. Context: I have been growing Juliet tomatoes for several years in my above ground planter. The planter is 3 feet x 8 feet x 2 feet deep. I have excellent growth of the plant, and a bounty of tomatoes.  Issue: This year, I have noticed that many of the tomatoes show a black connection at the stem end rather than what I expect which is white. I don't find any internal differences in the tomatoes. I also seem to have more falling fruit this year than normal. That indicates to me that there might be a soil or nutrient problem. I am getting ready to winterize- pull the plant and fallow the soil. Should I be adding anything this fall, or next spring before planting the next Juliet tomato? Or is the black something else

- Tomato Blight. Every year I plant 10 tomato plants, usually Big Boy and Romas, in my garden.  I rotate crops every year, water the tomato plants using a soaker hose and lay down a red plastic barrier before planting.  Every year, about mid summer, the tomato plant leaves begin to turn yellow with brown spots, beginning at the bottom of the plant and slowly creeping up the plant. I try to remove the leaves as soon as I see them appear but the disease progresses quickly and totally kills the plant.  How can I stop this from happening?  I have taken a diseased leaf to an Extension Office and I am told that this problem is caused by a bacteria in my soil but no remedy is recommended.  Help!!!!!

- Tomatoes splitting their skins. This summer, I planted two varieties of small (cherry) tomatoes. They grew well and flourished, but as they ripened, a large fraction of them had split their skins. This was true even of some that were not yet ripe. Oddly, even a day or so after harvesting only those with intact skins initially, I found many would split their skins over a period of hours following harvesting.  What's going on, and how can I prevent this in the future? My location is about a mile south of the St. Paul campus. My soil is only fertilized with compost from the leaves that drop from our trees each Fall. With the fairly rainy summer we had, I only needed to water the plants a few times during the summer, and never watered in the latter part of the summer

I am new to hydroponics, when I went to the Hydo store I explained that I wanted to grow tomatoes in 20L buckets using DWC method with bubblers to each bucket. The plants (Improved Apollo)are growing in a shadehouse with polycarbonate roof. I was recommended to use Dutch Master Gold One Flower nutrient at the standard dosage. I have done this and the plants are almost at ceiling height with 5 or more trusses on each plant x (10) the fruits are looking very appealing but this is not the reality. The fruits have a very hard core under the calyx and a hard white icy looking band of flesh under the skin there is not much taste. I have done some googling and it appears that the problem is yellow shoulder caused through a potassium deficiency. Does this sound a likely cause and can I do anything to rectify it?

Unfortunately this year I am having trouble getting my tomato seeds to fully germinate and the Bradley seeds are the worse. The problem occurs with seeds that I have purchased and with seeds that I have saved and seasoned. I place the seeds in a white wet paper towel placed in a plastic bag and put on top of my refrigerator. About 95% sprout. Then I carefully pick up the seeds using a toothpick and a flat knife and place them in small square peat containers filled with wet Miracle-Gro seed starter.

First they started developing dark (silver-gray) spots on their cotyledons, which then turned yellow and dropped off or simply shriveled.  Now the true leaves seem to be affected as well. The stems seem OK. The plants have also more or less stopped growing.  The seedlings are in a well-lit south facing window (well lit by Portland, Oregon standards, anyway...), were sparsely planted and not particularly heavily watered. Essentially all plants from a number of seed sources and types of tomato are affected. Chili plants and tomatillos sprouted at the same time appear fine to date.  Early blight, or something else?   Any tips on how to avoid contamination of subsequent attempts?   Given all seedlings were affected at pretty much the same time is the seed starting mix a likely source?  Thanks!

- Hardening Tomatoes. Hello, I was at a garden center and bought tomato seedlings early last week. I don't have a great deal of sunlight, so I brought them outside for a couple of hours on warm days and built the number of hours up, mostly for getting better sunlight. They all seemed to do well. It's been rainy and cold for the last several days and so I kept them inside. And then when I brought them outside again (it was about 58/60 degrees), a couple of the tomato plants wilted. I brought them in and gave them water, and they seemed fine. I water about once a week. My questions are: 1. Should I have waited to buy the tomatoes? I guess the normal thing to do is plant on Mother's day and harden off a couple weeks beforehand. I was afraid that if I waited till the first week of May to buy the plants, they would have no more of the variety I wanted. 2. I had sown some eggplant seeds on March 1, and now some of the leaves are turning a light greenish/yellow. Is that because they aren't getting enough light? Or is it a lack of nutrients.  3. Looking at the forecast, it's going to be in the 80s and even 90s at the end of this week for about 4-5 days. With lows in the mid-60s. And then afterwards, it will be in the 70s for highs and around 53 for lows for the whole first week of May. I want to bring my plants out to get more sun, what should I do when it's really hot (like 90). Should I leave them in the shade or bring them back in. Or does it not matter since they're just seedlings and not producing fruit yet? Is it stressful for the plants to be in such fluctuating weather? 4. Are nights in the 52/53 degree range too cold to leave them outside at night? What happens if the week before Mother's Day, it's still low 50s. Should I wait to plant them? And if it's a consistent low 50s through mid-May, can I just transplant early May and not wait till Mother's Day? 5. In the middle of hardening, what happens if it rains? Should I bring it inside?  Thank you!

- Potted tomato plants and cold frames. Hi.  I have several potted tomato plants (patio plants) that are currently in my kitchen.  I believe it needs to be 50+ before they can stay outside.  I'm wondering if a sort of cold frame would allow me to get them outside earlier.  I was thinking of making a box style frame out of 2x4 and covering it with clear plastic  sheeting.  This would be kept on a south facing patio under a deck 10' above.  They would have plenty of natural light, but no direct sunlight here, but their permanent home after it warms up will.  I'm wondering if this would work, to what outside temp would they be safe, and would be necessary to have them elevated off the patio floor?  Thank you

Hello,It seems that my neighborhood in SE Fort Collins regularly gets sprayed for the West Nile virus and I assume this year will be no different.Last year I found no definitive information that the spray used would be totally harmless to me. So I did not eat any more of my garden tomatoes after the spraying occurred. It felt like such a waste - very delicious tomatoes going to waste, along with the money and time I spent on them. I also did not make purchases at the farmers' markets in town after the spraying, as I couldn't be sure if the produce had also been sprayed.Covering my tomatoes to protect from the spraying didn't feel like a good solution either.

- Tomato plant problems. I have a very small space to grow tomatoes, and until last year I was quite successful and canned a great number of tomatoes. Last year my tomato plants starting showing damage around mid-June. At first slowly, on one plant and the damage spread to the other plants. I harvested very few tomatoes, but I put it down to the very wet weather - lots of rain at the beginning and then no rain for large stretches of time. This year I've barely gotten my plants in and they're already showing damage. See attached picture. I have never had to treat my plants with chemicals and I don't really want to start, but I will if the chemical doesn't have a long residual life and won't get into the fruit early in the plants cycle. At this point they have no flowers and I tend to pinch off the first few flowers to encourage more growth and more flowers. I hope you can tell from the picture what is going on. I haven't fertilized them yet so I'll give them a light feeding this week. Thanks for any suggestions you can offer.

- Tomato Wilting. Hi there, I hope you can give me some advice, I watered my tomatoes this morning as I usually do, they were all looking quite vigorous and healthy, then I went out this afternoon to start staking them up as they are about 2 foot tall now and I noticed one plant had started to wilt quite noticeably. this morning it was fine and this afternoon it is all saggy, none of the other plants around it seem affected. I started these from seeds and transplanted them outside to raised beds a few weeks ago and they have been growing fine. I have 4 different varieties but I am not sure which one is the affected one as they got mixed up when I transplanted them outside. I hope you can help Thanks very much for your time and effort cheers!

The first year the tomato plant did great. The second year i planted an heirloom variety and it started out great. It had beautiful tomatoes, but about halfway through the growing season the leaves turned yellow and it died. It didn't seem to affect the fruit at all. Now this plant is doing the same thing. I purchased it at a local farmer's market in SE Aurora from the same vendor as the previous two years. The variety is Shady Lady and the vendor said it was their hardiest variety.

I am having a difficult time diagnosing problems with my apple tree and tomato plants.The apple tree has a large branch with bad peeling and some dead smaller branches and also some new shoots. There are also some smaller branches that have died or at least didn't leaf out this year. I am not sure if the smaller branches didn't leaf out because of the frost or if it is related to the bad large branch. If you could tell me what you think it is and how to treat it, that would be great. Some of the leaves of the apple tree have damage to them and there are a few that are turning yellow. But, in general, the tree looks quite healthy. A friend suggested that the leaf damage could be from hail. My tomatoes suddenly have some leaves that are yellow low down and some with brown spots higher up. The green leaves look like they are starting to get darker spots on them too.

This year I added a new third bed in case it was because I didn't rotate enough (I mainly grow tomatoes, zucchini and peppers so it's hard to rotate to a different crop everywhere).  The third bed was filled with new soil from a local soil/mulch distributer.  I use a homemade soaker hose and never water from above.  I did use some older seeds for 3 of my 5 plants but even the new seed plants have blight this year.  Is there anything I can do to prevent this next year?  I do not bleach my pruners could that be the problem?  I put 4 plants in a 4x4 box with marigolds and one small basil, and the attached 4x4 box just had one indeterminate cherry tomato.  Also, everywhere I read online said to pull the affected plants, but I couldn't bring myself to do that because they still have a lot of tomatoes!  Is that ok or am I making it worse for next year?   These pictures are of the leaves I removed, and the last one is a plant from today one week after removing all affected branches (a few are affected now one week later).  Last year all the determinate plants slowly died from bottom to top until I had no leaves left, and this year seems like it will end up the same way.  Thank you!!  Mauree

Note:  I have been planting the tomatoes in 5 gallon buckets, with several 1/4 inch round holes around their bottoms for drainage, and filled with a half &amp; half mixture of Miracle Grow potting soil and good local top soil.      I do keep them very adequately watered

- Tomato problem. My leaves are curling on the entire plant. This is an outdoor hydroponic system, Alaska Grow Buckets, and I have never had this before. This is my first year at this location. And it may be spreading to the other plants.   The plant is Bonnie Big Boy In Highlands Ranch.Thanks! PaulAdditional info: The bucket system is a constant water level with a peat moss mix to wick the water to the roots. The roots near the buckets edge are exposed to air via holes in the buckets. This has given me 5 foot tomato plants in Highlands Ranch.I have been stewing on this and came up with the biggest difference between my previous no-problem crops and this year. This is the first year in this house, which has a salt based water conditioner/softener. This conditioned water, which I suspect is low in minerals and high in salt/sodium, has been going to the plants. I have flushed the water system, rinsed the plants, and bypassed the softener until I create a reservoir I can fill with non-softened water. This crop may be a write-off due to the salt/sodium in the medium. BTW, the cucumbers are not affected by whatever the problem is.Paul

When nicely ripe, you couldn't stack them in a bucket or container because the weight would crush the ones on the bottom, splitting the skins.

## intent: askextension_tomato/89188_Maryland
- Tomato leaf disease(s) I've always called my late-season tomato leaf disease "Early Blight," but one of your recent postings about tomato diseases made me reconsider, so I've looked at several of the entries on the HGIC website about tomato diseases and have just about concluded that most of the late-season problem I have is more likely to be septoria leaf spot.  The lesions on all but one of the plants don't have even faint halos, as they should if it's early blight.  I'm attaching three photos.  *8685 shows typical leaves (I think from a Juliet), with the lesions going through the leaves and with no halos.  *8688 shows lesions on the stem, perhaps another clue.  *8687 is of a Celebrity hybrid plant showing the overall problem.  I cannot remember that I've had such a bad problem so early in the growing season, but we've had so much rain this year that I'll point in that direction.  On a positive note, I have one plant that has been minimally affected by leaf diseases and rain checking or cracking of the fruit.  It was a free sample from Seeds 'n Such: Warrior 5443 (VFFFAStTylcv).  Wow, that cultivar must have gone to all the tomato universities in the world!  It's a determinate variety, about 4' tall, and will give me 15, maybe 20, medium-sized fruit.  I picked a half dozen today and will send a photo if you are interested.  Bob Nixon, HoCo MG (emeritus)

- canning tomato sauce. Last night, after cooking tomato sauce all day, in which I followed the recipe in your PNW 300 canning tomatoes recipe.  Adding lemon juice was not in the instructions for no meat sauce, so I didn't add it.  Also I pressure cooked the quart jars for 25 minutes at 15 lbs (that's what my cooker does).  I now realize I should have put the lemon juice in even though the recipe doesn't include that step.  Can I open those jars now, and re-cook and re can the sauce to save the product?  Is there any harm to cooking at 15 lbs and not 11 as the recipe calls for

- Crispy Tomatoes. Crispy Tomatoes    Hi, I live at 6,600 ft on the western slope in Basalt CO. I have   planted in the same 15X20 garden over 30 years. I get 8-10 of good sun each   day. Daily summer temps 50 -90 degrees. I plant Tomatoes, Peas, Zucchini,   Squash, Cucumbers, Beans, Basil, Sunflowers and Radishes. I usually rotate my   plants each year. Peas and tomatoes back and forth. This year I did not. I do   till each year, add sheep shit and also put a fish under each plant. I   fertilize with Miracle Grow every 2-3 weeks during the summer. I do water by   hand only bottom of plants. All my other veggie plants are fine and producing   well except my tomatoes which are slowly turning crispy. I have 10 plants of   different varieties. Last year they produced about 1,400 tomatoes. This year   I will be lucky to get a few hundred. Of the 10 plants 4 were store bought, 6   are from seed. The crispy leaves began with one of the store boughts and has   slowly affected each plant. The Early Girls have survived the best, they were   from seeds. See photos. Thoughts?

- Reducing the Boiling Temperature for Tomatoes by Using a Vacuum. Instead of boiling tomatoes for hours on the stove top to reduce them to make tomato sauce, can one reduce the boiling temperature (and save energy) by using a pot that can be evacuated, thus reducing the boiling temperature, possibly to room temperature? Note that I don't know if such an apparatus exists, even if this is possible. If so, where does one acquire such, and do you have processing guidance for using this method? Also, I assume that the sauce would still have to be raised to a sufficient temperature to kill bacteria during the final canning process

- tomato and pepper diseases. Hi,My vegetable garden is in Lakewood. I've had a significant problem this year with my tomatoes - all varieties affected. The leaves turn yellow, and brown and the fruits become motteled. I believe this is a form of blight due to a fungus in the soil. I've had the problem the past few years and have been diligent in rotating my crops. Although I have disposed of affected plants the problem continues to spread to healthly plants.This year, I also have experience similar problems with my peppers - several varieties. The fruit of the peppers also begins to rot on the plant.I do use weed cloth and wonder if this could contribute to the spread of the blight fungus.Can you comment on how I confirm the disease and take steps to mitigate it next year?Thanks,Dean

- Tomato disease question. Hello!  I am grateful for your assistance.  I have raised bed vegetable garden that I believe has Verticillium wilt fungus.....possibly septoria but I haven't seen a lot of the spots.  I noticed it in August of last year and it spread like wildfire.  I took out all effected plants and rotated the bed as usual (I rotate beds every 2 years)  Unfortunately, its back.  I always start from seeds, ....only planted some peppers from Tagawa. I trimmed all lower branches and began treating with Copper fungicide weekly at first sign....still, my plants are sick! I did not try to mulch them at transplanting as I thought the distance from soil to lower branches was far enough the spores wouldn't reach the leaves and I couldn't decide on a mulch to use...I heard straw brings weeds. Consistent water system set for 15 minutes morning and evening.My question:  Should I pull everything out from all raised beds and try Solarizing the soil or is it too late for this year?  Or, have a vacuum truck come and suck out most of the top layers of soil and start again?Below are pics.....1st is last year and a good look at 4 of my 7 raised beds,  other pics are of my sick tomatoes.  Thank you so much in advance from a very sad gardener :-(

- What's killing my tomato plants? I planted two standard size tomatoes (an early girl and something like a beefsteak, but not as big), with basil next to them both (it's doing well), a lilac off to one side (doing well), and another grape tomato on the other side of the lilac. The grape tomato has done very well and even has 8-9 foot vines on it. However, the two standard tomatoes started wilting and turning brown, starting with the lower leaves and moving upward through the plant. Some of the tomatoes don't taste good (moldy sort of), but they have continued to produce, although it is a small crop and they have produced some abnormally small tomatoes. I water in the morning every day if there's no rain, and only an additional watering in the early evening if they look wilted. The limited evening watering took care of the earwigs that were eating them, but then the browning/wilting started! I tried watering with a liquid fertilizer, but it did nothing except perhaps boost the grape tomato plant. I have since removed the worst affected plant entirely, lest it be some sort of transmittable infection that could get to the grape tomato. I have trimmed off all brown parts from the other plant, leaving only a couple leaves and the stems where there are a couple tomatoes ripening still

Is it safe to use without boiling water bath?  1kg firm cherry tomatoes  (As I mentioned above, with this amount of cherry tomatoes, you will have left over pickling fluid.) mint leaves garlic cloves, peeled and roughly sliced Pickling fluid:  200g brown sugar 1 litre cider vinegar 1 teaspoon salt  teaspoon black peppercorns Lightly prick each tomato a few times with a skewer.  (My Balls Blue Book advises this helps prevent the skins from splitting.) Pack the tomatoes into sterilised jars, layering with the mint leaves and garlic cloves as you go.  Pack the tomatoes as firmly as you can without damaging them.  Make sure each jar is full. Place the sugar, cider vinegar, salt and peppercorns in a pan over low heat. Once the sugar has dissolved, remove from the heat and cool completely. Pour the pickling liquid over the tomatoes. Gently push the tomatoes down to prevent air pockets forming. Tap each jar gently with a spoon to raise any air bubbles. Seal the jars. Store in a cupboard for 4-6 weeks before opening.  Refrigerate after opening.  Cuisine Magazine indicates the tomatoes will last a year

- preventing tomato fungus. I am planning this years garden and have a bunch of questions.  Please read carefully and answer all.  Setup:  I have six 8ft by 4ft raised beds enclosed in a 8ft deer fence.  We live next to open space that has river and trees.  We love fresh tomatoes and plant four of the beds with two each; another with peppers, the last with herbs.  I use drip irrigation with timer and rain sensor which comes on in early morning. Each year I try to fend off fungus alternating with biologics Serenade and Actinovate (predominately Serenade).  The last several years I have gotten fungus.  Last year I believe it was Septoria.  Rotation isnt much of an option as I use four of the beds for tomatoes. 1)	Do these two biologics work o.k. together or do they fight one another? 2)	 Is there something else you would recommend over this? Mannon Gallegly, West Virginia University professor emeritus of plant pathology, has made it his mission to develop a disease-free tomato. He and his research partner Mahfuz Rahman, released two new varieties of tomato last summer. (One called Iron Ladylimited seed only as far as I can find) Gallegly said the stink bug, specifically the marmorated stink bug, is the likely cause of Septoria increasing on tomatoes. Each year I hang up two stink bug traps on two sides of my deer fence to try to keep them off the tomatoes.  They do catch a number of stink bugs.   3)	Is this self-defeating?  I had been told the lure doesnt attract from far distances away like the old Japanese beetle traps 4)	Other thoughts?  Thanks for your time and consideration.

- Tomato Plant Problem. My tomato seedlings are approaching their 2nd leaf. They all started out a vibrant, lush green.  A few of the plants are beginning to develop an extreme light tan color to the nice, well developed first leaves. Not yellow. The lightest tan I can still call tan.  Yellow would probably be over watering. I have no idea what this is. In 50 years of starting my own seedlings, I have never seen this.  The soil I used is without fertilizer as per recommended by ask an expert. I waited for the first leaves to develop before adding any fertilizer. I used 2 tsp of a 5-10-5 liquid product per gallon of water. The tan actually started to develop just prior to adding fertilizer to my watering. The veins in the leaves remain green.  I'm thinking I still have an over watering problem. I have started to let the small 2 1/2" pots dry out at the top, and somewhat at the bottom between watering.  Same solution for my pepper seedlings. Absolutely no problems with them.  Thank you for any help you can provide.  Vinc

- Tomato plant disease? Hi - I wanted to find out the diseases of tomatoes that are prevalent in northern MN (I'm in Bemidji).  Every summer around early August - just when fruit is starting to ripen - the plants start dying from the bottom up.  First the leaves start yellowing, then browning, and soon the entire plant is dead and brown.  Is this late blight or other disease?  I notice it only in the plants that are outside - not in my small greenhouse, so I am guessing this is a water-borne disease like blight.  I do rotate my plants each year, and mulch the base of the outdoor plants to try to keep dirt off them.  I water at the base of plants, but the outdoor ones do get rain.  Any thoughts you have on this, I apprecaite! Thanks - Dian

After doing this, the tomatoes are red on the side that faces us, but green on the side that faces the fence.  Makes sense.  And because they dont ripen evenly, they dont taste very good.  How do we fix this problem?  How do we get these vines to grow more bushy, rather than spindly so that we dont need to tie them against the fence?

- Help diagnose my tomato woes? Two questions!  1) I live in a development built in a former commercial farm and have been growing vegetables in a 400 sq ft garden since 2008.  Tomatoes, squash, peppers, lettuces, herbs, etc.  First few years had ample production of most items (except, oddly, string beans  , and cantaloupe.).  After production declined in my tomatoes, I started amending in the fall or early spring, as your site describes, with good success.  Past two years I have not done that and been forced to amend soil the week-two before planting.  I have tried to make up for this by side dressing but production in tomatoes especially not great and tomatoes kust seem "meh" and not really thriving and in fact were yellowing leaves and innsome.cases stems (tomatoes themselves were OK thoigh smaller).  I was careful to use only fully composted (but purchased) compost.   There are two other factors I should mention:  ***The side dressing I use is Tomato Tone and I use as directed...but still felt like I am being rough to the very superficial roots.  Can i truly apply this just on too of soil barely mixed in so I don't have to dig into roots?  Or should i just try to carefully tunnel in bw the roots to get it "X inches" deep.  *** Last year in partixular, I tilled right before a heavy rain.  Could the suspected suoer comoaction have impacted tomatoe growth?  Thank you very much!  Anni

Last year, my tomato plants got infested with a fungus that I also came to the extension for help, and was told I had to thoroughly clean the barrels with a diluted bleach solution and that should take care of the problem. This year, I've planted tomatoes in the pots with fresh organic soil, and the plants just aren't growing - the leaves are a dull green color, not like a normal growing tomato plant. I put some organic fertilizer on the plants a couple of weeks ago also, with no effect.

- some kind of tomato wilt... Hello   Like so many others, I have tomato wilt questions. Is it fusarium wilt, verticillium wilt, and bacterial wilt or Walnut? I think I pretty much answered my question after typing this up  it must be some fungi.    Can I have the soil tested just to confirm? Does it matter what kind?  If I continue to fertilize them, will they get through the season? Or give up now.  Do I have to put them in pot next year or try growing resistant varieties?  Here are some observations and info:  	It does not appear to be impacting other nightshades. Not yet at least. It has not in the past years (this is the 3 year of wilt) 	We put straw down to prevent splashing 	We have raised beds but I dont/cant rotate very well. Just not enough space.  	Yes, maybe I put too much in a bed but there is always plenty of air circulation 	Recovers with rain and improves over night 	We grow our own from seed but I sterilized containers 	The garden is about 20 feet from the walnut drip line. Should be fine, right?  	The continue to produce fruit to some extent so I hate to cut it down to look at the stem and vascular system.  	Some tomato plants are not impacted. I dont know off hand which I have and if they are the resistant breed.   The information and services you offer are amazing. We are forever grateful.   Thank you,   Denise   note: the photos are from a couple weeks ago. More yellow spotted leaves have appeared at the base of the plant.

Almost all of the plants are doing well, but ONE plant, a variety called Earliana, is suddenly wilted. I noticed it 3 days ago and gave it extra water (just in case) but it's still wilted today.

I have the emitters one per plant placed at the stem where it emerges from the ground. 1. Is this a good location or should I move it out to the canopy area of the plant?2. Is one emitter per plant enough? 3. How often should the plants be watered or how deep of moisture penetration should I work toward?I have similar questions for Yellow Squash, Zucchini, Cucumbers and Peppers. I'm using 1-gallon emitters on the peppers and 2-gallon emitters on the squash and cucumbers. Thanks for your help on this!Edit: Oh and by the way I'm watering for about 60 minutes per watering event. Since installing the drip irrigation last weekend (June 30, July 1) I've watered twice for about an hour each time.

- Fungus on Tomato Mulch. One of our 6 tomato plants started getting brown and yellow spots (large, irregular) at the bottom, then the whole plant wilted. As we were pulling it out, we discovered what looks like a fungus on the mulch (cardboard covered with straw) beneath--and then discovered the same stuff below all of the other, healthy-looking plants. The fungus is tiny white spots held up on little stems. It's only growing in the shade of the plants, not out in the sun. It's growing on the mulch straw around the base, and a little ways up the stem of some of the plants--no mold is showing on any of the leaves, including on the one wilted plant. One of the plants (the only other of the same variety that we pulled--heirloom Pink Brandywine) is starting to show some yellow spots on lower leaves. What is this stuff? And if it's a problem, what can we do about it?

- tomato plant leaves damage on bottom branches. Every year , no matter where I put my garden (in 3 different places on our large  property), I get this problem with tomato leaves. it's always on the bottom branches.  Generally, there is healthy green growth in the middle and top of the plant, and I still get good fruit.  This year, I tried to preempt the problem by cutting off the lowest branches. Also,  as I see branches with spotting leaves, I cut them off  and toss them out of the garden. As you can see from the pictures,  the leaves get brown and yellow spots and borders,  then turn yellow,  then turn brown.  Only one of my 40 tomato plants is really bad, it's the sun gold cherry tomato pictured. But all ofvt hg em have some spots and yellow dying branches at t hg e bottom. Other than snipping off affected branches,  can I do anything ? I should note the plants are planted thru weed block permeable fabric so no mulch or weeds around them  and very little  soil splashes up

The leaves are curling, and some of the leaves have yellow spots, and some of them are yellowed. They just started producing a few fruits.  They are cherry tomatoes that I am growing in a 5 gallon Root Pouch in soil that is a mix of compost, peat moss, and vermiculite. I water them if the soil feels dry about 1/2 inch down. They are in an exposed, sunny location in my front yard.   Also, I recently fed tall my veggies this: https://jobescompany.com/product/jobes-organics-vegetable-tomato-granular.

- damaged tomatoes. I've been taught that tomatoes should never be refrigerated.  I also understand that despite how much we hate the cardboard taste of hothouse tomatoes, once a tomato begins to show pink it can be picked to ripen on counter to then taste as good as picking when ripe.  Is this approach actually viable or is taste compromised?  Every morning I find at least one tomato on the ground or still on the vine with 1 bite to 1/4 eaten.  Assume it is squirrels.  Some are totally green while others have begun to ripen.  Instead of tossing, I have cut off the chewed end, then cooked the remainder.  However, I wonder if it is showing pink or red, can the cut be covered with saran wrap (to keep out bugs), then left of the counter to ripen, or is the ripening process stopped by the cut (or does it matter if the cut is at the vine or blossom end), or would a natural rotting process take precedence once the protective shield of the skin is broken?   tn

- BER already?! all I want is a good tomato! Hello fine folks!  I have 64 tomato plants in a 16X4 foot space... SFG... I may be in over my head, but that is besides the point. So everything is going well. plants are staked, and growing like crazy! here are the facts:  1) I am on a new program with the emulsified fish liquid for a nitrogen boost, it rings in as 5-1-1, apply to roots once every other week, per the recommended dosage, 1.5-2Tbls per gallon (Alaskan brand, FWIW). 2) I have automatic drip irrigation going every 2 days in the early AM for 15 minutes. 3) I am applying an epsom salt liquid solution once every three weeks, spraying on top canopy in evening. 4) I have raised beds. 5) I have a compost mixture from a local landscaper what is comprised of compost, soil and a little peat, no complaints with any of my other vegetables.  So I have a lot of flowers on these tomatoes plants, but the first fruit coming off have blossom end rot, see attachment. not all fruit has this, but enough that I am concerned, hence this email.    What I have read says it is 2 possible things, possibly both. 1)over/under watering or sporadic watering or 2) I have a calcium deficiency.   I purchased a bag of calcium nitrate but have yet to apply it. I should say this is the second season in this raised bed, though last year was abysmal, and that was all my fault unrelated to this current issue. I turned the bed this spring, and used tomato tone when I turned it, working it in a few inches.  I am tempted to go the calcium route but in the meantime I have also backed off my water from 15 minutes every other day, to 10 min every other day. I know drip is very efficient, but I do not have a rating on how much i am providing. if you have any idea on how to test that, I am all ears. Thanks kindly for your consideration of my question.  Kind regards,   Jo

- leaf curl on two tomato plants. Of the 40 tomato plants in our garden, two of them have developed a leaf curl problem. The plants are green and have green fruit on them (pictures).  All of my tomato plants have a little  bit of early blight on the bottom branches (diagnosed by another expert on HGIC). The plants had a lot of healthy growth on the middle and upper branches so a week ago,  I sprayed those with pre-mixed Daconil  (0.087% Chlorothalonil) and it seemed to stop the spread of the blight. I cut off the blighted lower branches.  I also use a foliar spray of fish emulsion and seaweed for fertilizer (hoping the smell deters bunnies and deer too). But unlike the early blight, this leaf curling appears on only a couple of the many tomato plants. None of the rest of the tomato plants exhibit it. Any suggestions?

That had no effect.  It is still growing tomatoes but not at the same rate as the other two and it is half the size of the other plants.

But it got me. Last summer i had it covered in black cloth / plastic and did limted garden in a new area, about 20  away. But blight got there also. This spring I uncovered the garden and was hopeful, but there it was. I used some sprays but the plants are not as lush and fruitful. I use soaker hoses and mulch etc. Im very frustrated. I cannot move the whole garden due to lack of sun in my yard. I was thinking of burning a lot of brush twigs all over the garden. A controlled little fire.  Would this kill the blight?

- Measuring Tomatoes and Peppers in Canned Salsa. Hello, when a salsa recipe for canning calls for a quart of tomatoes I assume this is a quart of whole tomatoes, not chopped, correct?If so, does this  "7 quarts peeled, cored, chopped paste tomatoes" also mean unchopped, whole tomatoes?And how do you measure a quart of whole tomatoes being there is airspace around them and their size and shape makes it difficult to fill a quart with the tomatoes decently packed together? I ask because I know for safety's sake it is important to have the correct proportions of ingredients. Lastly, when a recipe calls for a long green chili how do you know what size this means? All my recipes come from the National Center for Home Food Preservation, but when they speak of long green chilis in an article separate from the recipe they list a range of sizes for these peppers, so again, for the sake of safety, I'm not sure in terms of measurements what exactly this means.

I purchased a box of canning tomatoes from the farmers market, skinned and cored them, cut them into pieces, crushed some of them (not all) with potato masher, added 4 teaspoons of citric acid powder to the mixture and stirred thoroughly, loaded 32oz canning jars, and placed them in my new pressure canner. I've canned in water bath but this was my first time pressure canning. I placed the 10 weight on and maintained 10 or 240 degrees for 30 mins. All but 1 popped. I removed the rings and can lift the jars holding the lids so they have a good seal. I did all this yesterday evening so around 10-12 hours ago. I noticed 2 things: 1) the level of the jars has dropped  in other words there is more space between the top and the lid than there was when I filled them; and 2) there appears to be foam in the jar. When I shake it the foam forms and then it settles, though it doesnt seem to go away completely (see pictures). On the internet Ive seen some posts that say throw it all away and others that say this is normal. Any advice would be appreciated.

I just put the mixture into my pint "hot" bottles , heated the lids and cooked them for 50 minutes in a boiling water bath. All 23 sealed but 2 this morning which I then pushed the 2 lids down and they sealed. I am worried that I did not do the 10 minutes boiling.

- Tomato Plants Having Issues. I have been growing tomato plants inside the house since January.  I started them with a hydroponics system with peat inserts.  Once they got a few inches I transplanted them to larger 3 inch pots and filled them with starter seed soil.  I have been using daylight bright fluorescent bulbs.  They were the brightest bulbs I can find.  They were doing very well until the last week or so.  The color seems to be getting lighter but the leaves are green.  Now some of the leaves have started to dry up on the plants.  They are most definitely ready for planting in the garden except it is still too early to plant outside.  I do water them regularly.  I don't believe it is over-watering because they are not turning yellow.  I don't believe it is lack of water because the plant is still standing upright and I keep the pot dirt moist.  I check them pretty much every day.  It seems like either an over watering or possibly they need fertilizer.    My bet is the plants want the sun which I cannot give them until they get planted outside.  They are in my basement and the only light they receive is from the fluorescent lights.  I have not added any fertilizer since I transplanted them to bigger pots because the soil has fertilizer in it.  I didn't want to over fertilize them.  I have included 2 pictures.  I singled one of the plants that is drying out.  The other is a shot of a bunch of tomatoes so you can see all of them.  I have about 150 tomato plants growing and it is starting to happen to a number of them.  It figures it would be the purple cherekee too which is the first picture.

- Tomato problem. Hi!  I bought tomato and other various plants from a local vendor the first time in May 2016. The tomato plants I purchased, had some sort of problem near the end of the summer. As the fruit ripened the fruit and leaves began to get spots and die. It seemed to start at the bottom of the plant and spread to the top. I have attached a photo. The next year, plants from another vendor had the same problem in our raised bed and pots nearby - so there definitely seems to be contact problem and resistance in the winter. I did not plant any tomatoes last year. I have been advised that I need to remove all the soil and start over and that it was probably brought into my garden by the original May 2016 plants. Before that year, our soil was very healthy and plants would grow up to the roof. Reluctant to go to all that effort of replacing the soil, I thought I should reach out to you for help. Can you give me your thoughts on the photo below? Also, in your experience, do you think it would have come from the vendor or somewhere else? We have one raised bed in an enclosed courtyard, pretty shielded from anything. Cheers,Jackie

- Deformed tomato seedlings. Please see the attached photo of some of the tomatoes I started from seed indoors. The tops are all deformed. It's just the tomatoes planted in this "row" of cells, the others in the adjacent cells appear to be fine. I'm wondering what happened to them, if I should scrap the plants, and if so do I need to take care not to spread a virus or something

- What is happening to my tomato starts? Hi all,My tomato seedlings have been doing amazing. Today when I went to check on them I noticed some silver flat spots and wilting of the leaves. These were not there 2 days ago. I thought maybe powdery mildew, but the more I look into it, the less I believe that's what it is. The spots seem to be transparent except where it follows the main vein in the leaf.

- Yellow Spots on Tomato Seedling Leaves. Hi! I have some tomato seedlings/plants that are approximately 5 weeks old. Some recently started developing yellow spots on the leaves. They also have spots on the underneath side of the leaves. I know they are purple also, but I believe that to be from my cool house/possible phosphorous deficiency/intense grow lights as they get the purple color every year. The yellow, however, is new. These plants are a variety of breeds. Purple Russian, German Johnson, Mortgage Lifter, etc. Lots of varieties. Only probably 10 plants out of 175 are affected. Plants are watered from the bottom, and only when they have dried out. Seeds were started in Fertilome Ultimate Potting Mix, Potted up to cells in the same potting mix with a bit of compost mixed in. (Same mix as last year) Then potted up yesterday into a larger pot with the same mix again. I know I waited too long and they should have been moved to bigger containers sooner, so the plants were in very close quarters. Otherwise plants have not had anything else applied to them. Plants have been indoors the whole time under grow lights. Thoughts? Thanks in advance

- Tomato transplanting. I start seeds in 1.5" sq x 2"H cubes, then transplant tomatoes  to a 4"H pot when stem 4-5".  With all other plants, I transplant high in the pot so new soil below is available for root expansion.  However, knowing that tomatoes form adventitious roots along the stem, I only add about .5" of soil below the rootball to encourage those side roots.  After doing that for 45+ yrs a light bulb just went on.  Do those roots form anywhere along the stem or just at leaf nodes?  Invariably the new soil does not cover even the cotyledon nodes, so if roots are only at nodes, they should be planted above new soil to promote regular root growth.  Which technique is best?  BTW, when plant in garden, a cpl tiers of lower leaves are always removed and those nodes are planted below grade

- Tomato Seedlings turning yellow with white dots. Hi I transplanted 8 tomato seedlings in late April into a raised bed #1 and two other tomato transplants in a different bed #2. The bottom leaves of all 8 seedlings in bed #1 have turned yellow and have these whitish dots (and some holes). I plucked those leaves off. I'm not sure if it's a disease and if the rest of the yellowing will travel up and if there's no hope for them. The seedlings are still small and I'm wondering if I should remove the plants and plant new transplants in its place while it's still early May. There were some cold 40 degree nights here in there at the end of April and I didn't cover the transplants with floating row covers. The two tomato transplants that are in bed #2 are fine and thriving well. If I do purchase new tomato transplants, should I plant them in bed #2 in case there is a disease in bed #1. I have peppers and eggplants I transplanted into bed #2. Could I move those to bed #1 or would the disease spread there too? I grew green beans and squash in bed #1 last year.

- tomato and cucumber plant diseases. I started many types of seeds indoors in early April and some of the leaves of my tomato and cucumber plants at the margins of my plant trays which also were at the edges of the sodium vapor lamp field began to turn brown and curled and some of the cukes died. Some of the seeds are old and the dirt was old. These have now been outside for a couple weeks and still look unhealthy. In reading about this it was recommended I remove the diseased leaves. I have gardened similarly for nearly 40 years but have never experienced this much disease before. My garden was overwatered by others years ago and the tomatos got diseased but after the overwatering stopped the plants recovered. I was expecting the same here but have been surprised how the plants appear to be getting worse. Having similar trouble with some squash/pumpkin and melons as seen in later photos.

I've done research and cannot determine what might be the problem or disease. I had trouble with mosaic virus in my cucumbers last year from heirloom seeds I ordered from a catalog. The virus was evident on the first leaves that emerged from the ground, but I didn't realize what it was until later in in the season when my cucumbers were stunted and dying as I've never had trouble with the disease before. I actually never heard of it until I researched it last year.

- Tomato spots - bacterial? Good morning,I'm hoping you can help me figure out if my tomatoes are doomed from a bacterial infection or if this is just something I can manage without getting rid of them. First, my garden is new and was created through sheet mulching with about 5" of compost and 3-4 inches of a topsoil/compost mixture; no additional fertilizer worked in. I planted tomato seeds outside on May 20 and interspersed the row with two types of tomatoes (Roma and cherry) and two types of peppers. The other side of the row has cucumbers that are doing great.I don't think I watered the row enough and only added straw mulch on 7. I watered the plants from the top until June 14 when we installed a drip irrigation system. The seedlings seem slow to grow and as of June 4 had lots of brown spots on the first leaves and only 1 true leaf in all the seedlings that had germinated. Today there are quite a few tomato plants with tiny true leaves but I did pull many that had first leaves with brown spots. In some cases the leaves withered or curled. On some seedlings, the affected leaves fell right off when I picked the seedlings. Most seemed to have decent roots. The peppers also seem slow to grow and I've only seen one true leaf in all the seedlings, but they don't have the brown spots. I've attached photos.The important thing is that I'm managing the garden with organic processes, so I don't plan to use synthetic fertilizers or other treatments.One more question - I haven't yet sent the soil away for testing. Is it too late to do that?Thanks for all your help.

- Can I put my container tomato plants in the garage and/or a greenhouse? We've had so much rain lately, my container tomato plants are developing blossom end rot.

- Curled tomato leaves. I have 8 tomatoes, all different varieties, growing in a raised bed.  The new leaves (the last 3 weeks or so) are curled and haven't expanded.  The older leaves look healthy - green and fully expanded.  There are even some green tomatoes on these plants. I planted these in a mix of roughly equal amounts of commercial potting soil, home-made compost and native soil and have not fertilized them or treated them with any pesticides.  There was some starter fertilizer in the potting soil.  I'm wondering if you can tell me what is causing this unusual plant structure and more importantly if there is something I can do to help the plants recover. More details:  there is no sign of bleaching, yellowing, leaf streaking, etc. The plants don't look drought-stressed - certainly the lower leaves are fully turgid and healthy. There are cucumbers also in this bed, but no other plants. This bed was newly constructed this year.  There have not been any tomatoes in this area for at least 3 years. The compost pile is a "cool" pile - I don't turn it but just add material to the top and then dig down into it when ready to get the compost. I rely mostly on rain and existing soil moisture for this bed, but when I do irrigate it, I use well water, which is a bit on the acidic side.

- Tomato leaves suddenly turning bright yellow. I have two tomatoes planted next to each other in a raised bed: a Cosmonaut Volkov and a Sungold. They seemed to be doing fine until I checked in on them today and found a bunch of their lower leaves turning yellow. It seems to start with yellow spots, and then progresses to the whole leaf. The yellowing seems to be affecting lower leaves (for now). I have been watering deeply and regularly (about twice a week since we haven't had too many very hot days, but I increase watering depending on the temperatures). Do you know what could be causing this? Should I be concerned?

- tomato plants with problem. Have a customer who's had this problem in 2 different raised beds for the last two years.  Last year we suspected this to be a wilt, so this year he made a new bed and put fresh topsoil, peat moss, and sand mix in it.  Both year's tomatoes he purchased from us start looking good but then a couple of weeks after planting start showing signs of distress, then eventually die.  We have not heard from other customers that they have any problems with the same tomatoes.

I have attached 2 pictures showingthis purple veining.Does this look tobe beet curly top? One other plant has curly leaves and several patches where the leaves are very small and shriveled up, with deformed fruit, and some brown spots on bottom(but so far I see no purple veins).

- Is this blossom end rot and why do my tomatoes have tails? I have 8 large healthy (or so I thought) tomato plants, 2 of each of 4 varieties, all set with lots of large green fruit.  This evening I noticed black spots on a few tomatoes on two different plants. The spots were not completed centered on the base of the fruit in each case, and many of the tomatoes seem to have small tails.  I have never noticed this before.  Could the black spots be blossom end rot (BER), why are there tails on my fruit, do the tails have anything to do with the black spots, and what should I do if this is BER?  I thank you. The fruit with the spots seen in the photo are Tiren F1, a San Marzano  variety from Jonnyseed, and they are supposed to be resistant to  Fusarium Wilt (Race 1), Tomato Mosaic Virus, and Verticillium Wilt

- Identification of tomato issues. Hello. I would greatly appreciate any assistance you could offer to help me determine the problem with my tomato plants.  Ive conducted a lot of research but I cant figure out of this is bacterial, early blight or early blight and this issue showed up several weeks ago.  Ive been using an antifungal spray repeatedly but its not totally effective. I do everything recommended for growing tomatoes, amending soil with natural organic ingredients, mulching under plants, removing bottom branches, and spacing properly for aeration. Unfortunately whatever it is clearly it must be present in the garden.  The pictures dont show it well but the stem has some spots as well.   After identifying it I would appreciate if you could provide any suggestions as to what I can do to eliminate this problem in the future.  Do I need to take a break from growing tomatoes and solarize the soil and the mulch next year etc?  My grapes also appear to have grape rot which leads me to believe my entire garden has issues.

Since then it has produced tomatoes, but many of them have a brown-black ring at the bottom (looks like the top of an acorn) and they are squishy.

- Please help - ALL our tomato plants are in bad shape!! Hello,I would greatly appreciate help to diagnose the problem with our tomato plants. We live in a residential neighborhood in southeast Denver. In May I bought 11 tomato plants and transplanted them into pots. For over a month I took them in and out of the house - putting them out when it was sunny but keeping them in when we had hail and late snowstorms and frost. On June 8 we finally planted the tomatoes in the garden. We had purchased bags of manure from Ace Hardware and had it tilled in very deeply before we planted. All the plants were healthy and growing for over two weeks.We then went out of town from June 26-July 8 (a neighbor watered the garden while we were away) and when we got home, all 11 of the plants were in terrible shape. They look like they are all going to die. There are several distinct issues. On the stems there are both light-colored and dark spots. On some leaves there are also light-colored spots, but most of the leaves have black on them. Some look like they have been eaten away (with little of the leaf left), others look like they were beaten by hail, others are drying up and curling and cracking, like they were burned. We have almost no flowers and on the couple fruits we have, there are light-colored spots on them. The plants are thin and just don't look good at all (which you can see if you enlarge the last photo). I understood we did have a hail storm while we were gone, but clearly this cannot be the only problem. We don't know what to do to try and save these plants!Please, please give us some idea of what we are up against and how we can save these plants! I have many more photos but will add what I am allowed here.Thank you!!P.S. I found out after posting this my husband made an inquiry via email; not sure if it will go to the same office or not.

Will you take a look at the photos and help me explain what might be going on? And also, if there is any hope of reviving them this year and solutions for next year's crops.

- Tomato Issue. Hello "Ask an Expert",  I have seen something over the past few years, and finally thought I should ask someone and see if they know what it was.  It probably affects about 1 in 20 tomatoes or so.  I do experience the occasional blossom end rot as well, but this seems a little different.  It's kind of like the bottom of the inner seed column gets kind of dry and brown. It doesn't seem to affect the tomato too much, I just cut that part out and it seems mostly fine.  If there is a way to cut down on this though, I would be interested in finding out how to do so. The variety is "San Marzano". Any thoughts about what this is, and how to avoid it would be much appreciated. Thanks! Todd Holmberg

However, I noticed that a few of the plants had been chewed back, probably from deer, which we've seen in our yard.    I'm wondering if the deer could have passed along a fungus or virus to my otherwise healthy (robust) plants.    There are a lot of green tomatoes on the plants.  Should I leave the tomatoes on the dying vines and let them ripen, or pick them green and let them ripen inside.  (I'm assuming the tomatoes are OK to eat even if the plants are dying.)  Last question:  Once I pull the plants, what should I do to prevent a recurrence of this problem next year.

- Canning tomatoes question. Hi, I run a website where I've posted recipes, including preserving recipes, for 10 years (AnOregonCottage.com). I practice and promote safe canning techniques and try to educate my readers on what is safe and what isn't.  I have a question about water bath canning with tomatoes. Many years ago I stopped peeling tomatoes for things like salsa and chutney, skipping the step and just coring and pureeing the tomatoes before cooking with the other ingredients. My understanding is that peeling was mainly a texture/product issue and not a safety issue.   I've had a few readers tell me this is not safe because of bacteria on the peels. This doesn't really make sense to me, since if there was there wouldn't really be a way to keep it off the tomatoes as you peeled them, either. But I can only find articles in newspaper publications that say it is safe to keep peels in canned goods and not an actual extension office or the national preserving site.  Can you clarify this for me so that I can pass it on to my readers? Thank you, Jami Boy

- Do heirloom tomatoes get tired? Last year I grew a mix of heirloom and hybrid tomatoes in a community garden plot (full sun).  The soil was very rich and this was the first time in 3 years I planted tomatoes in that section.  The heirlooms were Cherokee Purple and Tiffen Mennonite.  The hybrids were Better Boy and Tolstoi.  They all got the same amount of watering and care.  I planted all of them in mid-May.  By early August, the heirlooms seemed exhausted, that is, the size and number of tomatoes dropped precipitously.  The hybrids continued producing as expected into September, when I pulled the plants out.  There did not seem to be much of a difference (hybrid vs. heirloom) in the amount of blight or other diseases on the plants as production was dropping, though later in the season (late August), the blight was more extensive on the heirlooms.  Can heirlooms get exhausted?  I dont recall this happening before (I always plant CP, though this was my first year with TM).  Should I stagger planting to ensure a longer season for the heirlooms?  Thank you for your help.

The sun-gro pro mix is a seedling mix comprised of Canadian sphagnum, vermiculite, bark, dolomite lime and a wetting agent. To this is added more vermiculite, about 2 qts. of sand, 2 lbs. hydrated lime, 8 oz. mycorrhizae, 2 lbs. earthworm castings, 1 oz. root stimulator powder, 1oz. fish bone meal , 12 0z. bat guano, 12-16 0z. azomite, 8 oz. langbeinite, 1 lb. dried molasses, 8-10 oz. biochar.While none of this may be harmful, I question the adding of more lime to a mix that already may have it in sufficient quantity. There is also no actual fertilizer component to this mix, but seemingly only traces of nutrients in small quantities. Bit of a long winded question, Thank You for your patience.

It is usually a "late-in-the-season" event.  I have tried various neem sprays and fusarium innoculates, but for the past few years, all my tomatoes eventually get this disease and fail.  I would like to get a "disease-resistant" tomato variety.  Given the diseases of tomatoes in our area, what varieties would you suggest as the least disease-prone

- Dying tomato seedlings. Hello,  For the second year in a row, my tomato seedlings have developed a problem with their leaves. Last year they ended up dying before planting them outside. Id like to avoid that if possible! Ive attached a few pictures of what they look like.  We started the seeds in peet moss, used a heat mat to help promote germination. When they had their 2nd set of true leaves we transplanted them to small pots with sterile seedling mix for soil. They have been under a grow light. Once we transplanted them, we began fertilizing once a week with half strength fertilizer.  I hope you are able to give us some clues as to what we are doing wrong.  Thank you so much! Libert

- Tomato & Tomatillo seedling disease. Ive started a variety of seedlings indoors within the last several weeks and have noticed something affecting my tomato and tomatillo seedlings. The leaves appear to get bumpy light spots and then become necrotic in those spots, before eventually the leaf dying completely. This is affecting the tomatillos far worse than the tomatoes. The oldest true leaves are the worst and new growth looks okay for now. I forgot to sterilize my seeds (ones that I collected years ago), but the trays and seed mix are all brand new. The last picture shows the fungus I have growing on the soil surface, but I didnt lose any seedlings, had fantastic germination, and all other plants are healthy (marigolds, herbs, lettuce, Mexican gherkins, etc).

- Tomato plant problem. I am starting 4 tomato plants inside right now.  Two are Early Girls, and two are some type of cherry tomatoes.  Two of them  started having wilted leaves and then they fall off.  This started with the first leaves ( the ones that come out when they first germinate) and now more are doing the same thing.  I did not document which we ones were the early girls or cherry tomatoes.  However, the same ones are having the same problem.  The other two plants are okay so far.  In other words, it's the early girls or cherries are having the problem.  You may be able to identify the types by the leaves.   I am not familiar with tomato plants enough to do so.    I started them from seeds in sterilized seed starter mix and then moved them to a 4" pots with Foxfarm Happy Frog potting soil.  I water them with 1 tsp of Foxfarm Grow Big liquid plant food in 2 liters of water daily.  I am growing them under cfl and neon bulbs in a cabinet with an oscillating fan in one of my bedrooms.

- Tomato Leaf Problem. I started some tomato plants in the house about 6-7 weeks ago and they have been doing great until this last week.  They have white spots on the back of the leaves now on a bunch and it is for the most part killing the leaves.  Suspect it will kill the plant eventually.  I have noticed some gnats flying around and was wondering if that is what is happening to them - flying insect eggs.  I don't see powder from what I can see so I don't believe it to be powdery mildew.  The dirt I am using is store bought from Lowes.  I have included two pictures which show my issue for the most part.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.  I have unique stuff growing here in the house and you can't get anywhere else.  By the way, I am growing these plants in my finished basement.  They are a heat mat.  Been on one since the beginning.  Never took them off.  The room is usually 78-80 degrees thanks to computers running and those heat mats.  There is humidity in the air.  Not a huge amount but definitely there.  I have full spectrum fluorescent bulbs giving light source.  No natural sun yet.  Was going to start taking them outside this week or next for hardening.  They really have looked good up to this week.  I was patting myself on the back they were doing so well.  I originally started them in peat plugs, then when they sprouted about 2 weeks or so I took the humidity lid off and transplanted to larger peat pod (3-4 inch size) and filled with dirt.  Been watching every day for watering and waiting till the peat pots start to feel dry and then I water so I don not believe I have been watering too much.  When I do water I put a little water on top dirt and fill containers with about half inch of water so the pots absorb the water.  I try to not get water on leaves but that does happen on occasion.  Most of the water does evaporate because of the heat mats.  Please help.

- Probable tomato or tobacco mosaic virus? Hi there, I believe our large garden has been hit by a mosaic virus, whether tobacco or tomato is uncertain. the disease appears to effect tomatoes, peppers, okra. have yet to see it in other types of plants (we have cantaloupe, cucumbers, ground cherries, and one recently-purchased eggplant). All the affected plants had been close together in our pit greenhouse, doing well until less than 2 weeks ago. I would like to get a confirmation on this self-diagnosis if possible.  In some plants, the disease distorts the overall shape of the plant, with leaf crinkling and pulling inwards, creating an impression of bubbly or blistered surface on the leaves. All  seem to have leaf vein involvement, the veins become brittle and sometimes discolor to a purple or yellow. when touching the leaves, they snap easily.  thinner-leafed varietes show a lot of leaf curl. many leaves have patches of yellow, especially close to the vein. some  show die-off of older leaves closer to the soil as they become more effected.

- Is it absolutely necessary to rotate Tomato plants to different raised beds every year? My husband and I LOVE home-grown tomatoes and really only want to grow tomatoes in the 3 raised beds in our back yard.  So far, we've been successful planting tomatoes in 2 of the beds for the past 2 years.  We always plant different varieties so there are not two plants of the same variety in the same bed.  Each bed is 8' x 4', and we've had 6 plants to each bed, mostly small to medium sized tomatoes.   I've spent the last few hours researching various sources online re: the necessity of crop rotation with tomatoes.  About 25% of the sources say that this is not absolutely necessary as long as the soil is amended each year to provide nutrients that might have been leached in previous growing seasons.  One source even said that tomatoes prefer to be planted in the same spot!   What does Cooperative Extension say?  While we also have 3 raised beds in our front yard next to the sidewalk, we'd prefer to keep the tomato plants in the backyard to prevent passers-by from helping themselves to our crops.  If we don't absolutely have to rotate the tomato plants to the front-yard beds, what else (besides amending the soil) can we do to ensure a good healthy crop of tomatoes?

- Tomato leaf spots and curling. Hello,  Can you help me identify the problem affecting my tomato plants? I believe I have two separate issues, though perhaps they're connected. All the plants were all grown in both organic and non-organic potting and compost planting mixes, sewn in a raised greenhouse bed and then potted and brought into open air during nice days.  1) Leaf spots. Especially on the lower leaves of a few of my plants, the leaves are developing dry, brown spots. It appears to be the spaces between major veins in the leaf that are drying. Affected types are Sungold Orange Cherry, Black Cherry, and Little Napoli. Couldn't come across any photos online that were an obvious match to help me ID the issue, but I've attached a close-up of some of my leaves.  2) Leaves curling. The leaves do not appear to be weak or droopingthey are green and crispbut pronouncedly curl downwards on some of my plants. On some cherry tomatoes, lower leaf stems stick out from the main stem at a right angle and then turn down (but individual leaves along the branch are not curling up nor down). On most of my Brandywines, the more obvious curl is in the newer leaves, with the new leaf stems and large individual leaves curling down almost like a fiddlehead (but otherwise appearing healthy). I've attached photos with examples of both.  Only one Sungold Cherry tomato plant appears to be affected by both leaf spots and downwards curling. There appears to be no other overlap between the two issues.  Can you advise what the problems may be and what I need to do with the affected plants?  Thanks in advance, Ca

I amended the raised beds last fall with manure, and all the beds with composted leaf manure that I got from a local guy this spring. Soil pH is 7.3. I have had my soil tested and can send you other readings, if needed. Any ideas? Thank you,

- Tomato leaf problems. Dear experts, I would very much appreciate help from you. I purchased sun sugar tomato plants from Valley View farms. They looked healthy but upon further inspection, the first plant (Shown in pictures 1 and 2) has blotches of yellow on the leaves. I cut off the lower leaves and sprayed a copper fungicide in the morning. Can you identify the problem? Is it leaf mold? Early blight?  The second tomato plant- also sun sugar has darker spots on the leaves and looks droopy overall. The dark spots appeared after I had brought the plant container inside to protect from the cold last weekend. I have sprayed copper fungicide on this one as well. Does it look like septoria or something else?  Please also recommend best treatments for both my plants. Thank you

- Pinching off early tomato flowers or buds. I heard you should pinch off buds (future fruit) if they appear early on tomato plants so the energy goes into growing at first. I remember leaving 2 early buds on a plant one year. I got 2 early tomatoes and the plant then died.Should early tomato buds be pinched off and when do you stop?Thank you very muc

- Matt's Wild Cherry Tomatoes. For many years, I have bought Matt's Wild Cherry Tomatoes at Tangle Town Gardens.  This year Tangle Town will not have any--the owner told me that the supplier informed him that they did not germinate well this year.  Bachman's have carried them in the past--but not on their list for this year.  Do you have any suggestions on where I can purchase these plants?  I have tried numerous stores, but to no avail.  Thanks, Caro

- low-acid tomatoes. We are allergic to Citric Acid, and can only eat low-acid tomatoes.  I know canning is a lot about pH, and Citric Acid is often used to pump up the acidity.  If I want to can tomatoes, tomato sauce, or Salsa, can I use another acid like Vinegar and use a meter to make sure the product hits a proper pH?  Or do you have specific canning recipes for people who can't use Citric Acid

- Whats going on with this tomato? I just planted a sungold tomato plant on Tuesday. It suddenly broke out in these spots. Do you think this is sunburn or septoria leaf spit? Or something else? Its starting on the lower leaves but working its way up.

- Dark areas on tomato vines. Hello I bought some plants from a local nursery and two of the beefmaster tomatoes came in bad shape. The tomatoes came 1.5 feet tall and Still in tiny containers. They were flowering and even producing some tomatoes. Some of the leaves had gotten very yellow and crinkly and there were darkened areas on some of the vines of both plants. I pruned off the flowers and tomatoes to help try and get some new leaves and after 3 days theyre starting to look a little better. But, the darkened areas on the vines are still there. So I am wondering if maybe the darkened areas are a virus, fungus, or infection and or that I may need to remove the plants and plant with new Tomato plants. Also, is there a place I can donate to the ask an expert/ master gardeners as thanks for all the help? Thank yo

- wilt in tomatoes. My tomato plant got vercitilium wilt (I think) about 4 years ago.  I planted another tomato plant in the same spot and that one got it too.  I have waited a couple of years now, putting other stuff in that place (swiss chard, mainly) but am leery of trying a tomato in that location.  How long do I have to wait to plant tomatoes there?  Is there any way to get rid of the wilt disease?  Or can I plant a wilt-resistant tomato plant there

- tomato plants ruined by an invader! Six tomato plants in a raised bed, planted about a week ago, a 8 - 10 inches high were mostly ruined over one day.  One is still in tact.  They others have all leaves eaten off, including side branches.  Two of them were dug up and lay next to the bed, with all but the main stem left. In the other beds are peas and beans that have germinated...a few inches high.  And strawberries.  All of these were left alone.  Any idea what animal would do this?  Thank you

- Tomato pests. Hi, We just transplanted our tomato from little pots inside to the garden. Within a couple days there were tiny white circles on the leaves. The back ups that are still inside don't have any problems. We thought it might be sun burn or fungus, but then whole sections of leaves were gone. Now, whole leaves are missing. Something very small is eating the leaves but we don't know what. We tried spraying watered down neem oil, but the little sprouts started to wilt.  We haven't seen the bugs in the act, only various tiny bugs on the plants.  Here's a picture of a cotyledon with bug bites. What could be the problem, and how do we stop or slow it?  Thank you for your help  Mike Tuccin

- Cucumber and tomato diseases. Hi there,  I would so much appreciate your expertise. We just planted these healthy cucumbers in a pot last week, and now they are completely wilted or diseased.  Right next to them are basils that look fine.  We also have a mal-colored tomato -- but maybe that's a soil deficiency?  The pic is a bit fuzzy but it's got white mottled leaves.  Thanks so much for your help
