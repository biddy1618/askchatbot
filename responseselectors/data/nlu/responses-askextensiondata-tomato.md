  - Suggestions:1. A soil test done by the CSU Soil Lab or another local lab may be useful. While a soil test cannot determine what types of fungi are in the soil, it may give you an indication of what is wrong with the soil, if anything. For example, a high level of salts (salinity) in the soil can damage roots of tomatoes, resulting in browning of leaves. High salts could result from using too much fertilizer or too much manure in the soil. See Horticultural Applications for Gardeners at http://www.soiltestinglab.colostate.edu/2. Try to grow tomato plants in a different area of the garden in 2013. IF soil-borne disease is the problem, moving tomato plants to another part of the garden will help.Where tomatoes grew in 2012, grow anythingother thantomatoesor relatives eggplant, peppers, potatoes, tomatillos.3. Try growing tomato plants with multiple disease resistance - the letters/abbreviations after the tomato name indicate that variety has some resistance to disease. For example, the letters VFATTSWV after a tomato variety name indicates it has some resistance (NOT immunity) to several common tomato diseases. 4. Avoid watering tomatoes with overhead irrigation, which promotes foliar diseases. Ideally, apply water at the soil level, for example with drip irrigation.5. Ensure that soil for tomatoes is loose and well-drained. Compacted clayey soils often result in root rots and in turn, poor tomato production. Adding sand to a clayey soilusually backfires. Better to add organic materials to the soil to amend and loosen it.See also:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.htmlhttp://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07235.html

  - There is an actual recipe in the latest edition of the Ball Blue Book on page 65. It makes a good base and then when you open it, make a rue with butter, flour and milk and slowly add the soup base and it makes a great soup. This is however a pressure canned version. I have also taken the tomato vegetable juice recipes in the OSU PNW 300 publication on canning tomatoes. In this recipe you add 3 cups of chopped vegetables such as onions, celery, garlic and carrots to 22 pounds of tomatoes. Cooked the mixture until tender, and puree. Then continue cooking it until it thickens into a sauce. I can mine in pints. Be sure to add 1 T bottled lemon juice per pint and process in a boiling water canner for 35 minutes or add 2 T lemon juice per quart and process for 40 minutes. This added to a rue of butter, flour and milk is excellent. Be careful to slowly add the tomatoes to the rue so the soup does not curdle. You can season it to taste after you make the soup.l (I like to add a little basil, powdered garlic, salt and little sugar to taste.Good luck and thanks for using Ask and Expert Nellie Oehler

  - We do not have enough information to diagnose the problem on the tomatoes. The fruits and foliage of tomatoes can be subject to damage by many different diseases. Also, a large number of problems may be cultural and environmental. These include, insufficient water, nutrients, space, sunlight and support; poor soil, low pH, temperature extremes, root damage from cultivation, planting too late or early, plants not hardened-off properly, and setting out poor transplants. Please see our online publication, "IPM Series: Tomatoes" http://hgic.umd.edu/_media/documents/hg56.pdf    for more information on tomatoes and their diseases. Also, go to our Plant diagnostic Website and view photos of Spots/Rots on tomatoes http://plantdiagnostics.umd.edu/level2.cfm?categoryID=61See our Photo Gallery of Tomato Diseases on Our Vegetable Website called "Grow It Eat It " http://growit.umd.edu/EarlyBlightPhotoGallery/mh

  - Michelle: IF you see that there is not an issue with the tomoatoes inside the jars then the product should be safe to eat. Mold will grow on the outside if she spilled a bit of tomatoes on the sides and did not get them wiped off. Also if the seal is intact then the product inside should be OK. However, to take the extra step to make sure the prodcut is safe... BEFORE consuming put the product in a pot and bring it to a rolling boil for 10 minutes prior to consuming the toamaotes. This will destroy any toxin or other bacteria that might be in the food... But I think they are good. Also I should mention we recommend that home canned foods should be consumed within two years of canning them. They are now 4 years old... However as I said before if the seal is intact and they were pressure canned properly then they should be safe after the 10 minutes of brought to a roling boil.

  - Page 13 of the following publication shows pot size, sunlight requirements for tomatoes and chillies. We do not usually grow maize in pots, because this crop is wind pollinated and a larger planting is needed to produce enough pollen to pollinate each kernel on each ear. For example if one row ofmaize is planted the ears do not pollinate well. Ifthe maizeis planted in a block of4 rowsgood pollination is obtained. http://www.ca.uky.edu/agc/pubs/id/id128/id128.pdfThere are many variations on potting mixes. I would suggest that you use3 partssandy red soil, 1 partor more vegetable compost and1 part composted goat dung. If peat moss or rice hulls are available, reducethe vegetable compost by half and make up the ballance with rice hulls or peat moss.Do not use fresh goat dung as it is high in ammonia and will burn or kill your plants. Itshould be composted for a minimum of 8 weeks, preferably 6 monthsto be usable.

  - This is an interesting question. If the tomato plant you have was not the result of a hybrid (i.e. controlled) cross, the seeds from the tomato fruit will be generally the same genetics as the original plant (tomatoes largely self-pollinate). If, however, you wanted to clone a hybrid plant, you can do that from cuttings. Here is one link that might be worthwhile: http://www.diyseattle.com/backyard/gardening/rooting-tomato-cuttings/ Back to your original question, I would select for vigor as a proxy for cutting choice but this is still a bit of a guess as to how any individual plant will perform come time to fruit. We had some grafted plants last year at a test garden that grew more vigorous than the non-grafted version but started fruiting later and ended up producing the same amount of fruit as the un-grafted one. Vegetative propagated plants can accumulate viruses so cutting propagation might not be worth doing more than one cycle. At a minimum, cull any plants exhibiting off-type appearance during the pre-fruiting stage. Hope this helps. Feel free to call or email me directly if you still have questions.

  - Dear Grower,There are lots of resources available on growing tomatoes in high tunnels. You can go to Google and find this information.The following publication from Minnesota would be worth a look:http://www.extension.umn.edu/distribution/horticulture/M1218.htmlThis document covers all aspects of tomato production in high tunnels, from sowing to harvest.The researchers in Minnesota recommend using early ripening determinate cultivars to capture the early market, followed by the use of indeterminate cultivars that will extend the season. 'Sunshine' is a standard determinate type; 'Cobra', 'Geronimo','Trust'and 'Buffalo' are popular indeterminate types. You may wish to look at the seed catalogs of some northern seed companies, including Johnny's Selected Seeds, Harris and Stoke Seeds. Please contact me if you need any more specific information.

  - You can grow just about any type of vegetable in a raised bed that is 10 inches deep. Usually the most common types of vegetables will be plants that dont have runners. Growing root vegetables like onions, potatoes,beets, carrots, turnips, and foliage plants like lettuce, spinach, swiss chard all do well. Plants that want to climbcan be grown in a raised bed but you will need to have a stake or trellis system to tie them up like beans, peas, and indeterminate tomato varieties. Growing summer squash will also work fine since they dont have runners.

  - I'm not sure what the bulbs are, but if you invert one and carefully pop out one of the seedlings - look at the rootball...if mostly roots/little soilvisible and it holds together easily, then it may already be past time to shift seedlings to a deep 6" pot. Last frost in CO Springs averages May 6. Many gardeners set out hardened tomato transplants prior to that in "walls o' water" or similar protective structures. Harden seedlings/plants over the 2-3 weeks prior to May 6 by gradually exposing them to ever-increasing exposure to wind, sunlight and colder temperatures. Plants can come back into the garage at night if temperatures could drop below 32.Many gardeners find that hardened tomato transplants set out late May "catch up" with those set out earlier under walls o' water or around May 6.See also: http://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/720.htmlhttp://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/743.pdfhttp://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/717.htmlhttp://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.htmlhttp://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/07220.html

  - StakingStaking requires wooden or metal stakes 5 to 6 feet long for indeterminate varieties and 3 to 4 feet long for determinate varieties. Wooden stakes should be at least 1 inch square. Metal stakes can be of smaller diameter and have the advantage of lasting many years. Do not use chemically treated wood. Sections of concrete reinforcing rods (rebar) make excellent tomato stakes. Space plants 18 to 24 inches apart in the row and drive a stake next to every plant or every other plant. Place the stake 3 to 4 inches from the base of the plant on the side away from the first bloom cluster to prevent trapping the fruit between the plant and the stake. There are many ways to prune and tie tomato plants. Limit staked indeterminate plants to two or three fruit-producing branches. A popular method is to select the main stem, the sucker that develops immediately below the first bloom cluster (a very strong sucker), and one other sucker below that. Remove all other suckers and as you tie the plants, periodically remove additional suckers that develop on selected branches. Tie individual branches to the stake with soft cord by first tying twine to the stake and then looping it loosely around the plant. Never tie a plant immediately below a fruit cluster because the weight of the fruit may cause the plant to sag and strip the cluster from the plant. Continue to prune and tie the plant as it grows. Practicing this method should give you good results.

  - What you are describing is a common issue among home tomato producers all over the country. There are many diseases that affect tomatoes and most are managed by buying disease resistant varieties and a frequent use of fungicides on the plants. The garden fungicides are not terribly toxic to humans and if you practice a little bit of care can be used safely. Soil treatments are often the most toxic and the least effective.Take a look at the following resources for information on varieties that have resistance to common blights and wilts and the guidance to good control of the other diseases. Unfortunately, many diseases require preemptiveapplications of the disease controls. Once the disease is seen, too much damage is done. http://contentdm.nmsu.edu:2011/cdm/compoundobject/collection/AgCircs/id/8112/rec/3http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/vegetable/tomato-problem-solver/http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G6461http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G6202http://extension.missouri.edu/p/G6203

  - Hello there-Growing tomatoes along the Front Range is always a challenge. Last year my tomatoes did great, but my neighbors were terrible. My suggestion to you is to try varieties that fruit early and sound delicious to you. Tomatoes like a temperatures around 85 degrees- which is becoming rare along the Front Range, so when we have the really high temperature (95+ degrees) the tomatoes have issues with pollination- thus a terrible yield for us.  I have included a CSU Colorado Master Gardener GardenNote on Growing Tomatoes http://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/717.html   I have also included a CSU Extension Fact Sheet on Irrigating the Vegetable Garden http://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/714.html   This information should help you manage your tomatoes, which is really the key to growing a healthy plant- trial and error also works!

  - Non-producing tomatoes are a big disappointment. This could be caused by diseases, low soil fertility, incorrect soil pH, or a combination of these factors. First, take a soil sample into the OSU Yamhill County Extension Office for a free pH test. Follow their directions for adjusting the pH if necessary. Vegetables in general are heavy feeders, so it is important toannually add a 2 - 3 inch layer ofcompost or composted manures. Growing plants in the same place year after year allows for a build-up of disease causing organisms. Try planting beans or peas in the tomato area this year. Here is a link to "Preventing Plant Diseases in Your Garden and Landscape" it has full details on crop rotation.http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/17465/fs242.pdfHere is a link to a publication, "Grow Your Own tomatoes" with helpful information on successfully growing tomatoes.http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/14210/ec1333.pdfFinally, plan to plant your tomatoes indifferent spots each year, even if that means planting them in large containers.

  - Your container should be at least a foot across and a foot wide, though there is no problem going a bit larger. There are advantages and disadvantages to each type. Plastic retains water better and holds up longer, but if it's black (like most nursery pots) it can get pretty hot. Here, we grow them in all three types and don't see any problems as long as you can keep them evenly moist. The smaller or shallower the pot, the quicker it will dry out - so you'll need to keep an eye on things. When tomatoes are allowed to dry out, they are more likely to get blossom end rot.

  - Hello Wade, and thank you for asking about your tomato plants. Nurseries sell plants before it is warm enough to plant them outside without protection. It has been in the 30 degree-range the last few nights in the Portland area. Tomatoes need much more warmth, even at night. It is very unlikely your plants have a disease or will benefit from any sprays or treatments. Check out this great information from the Clackamas County Extension Master Gardener Volunteers, Growing Tomatoes in the Home Garden http://extension.oregonstate.edu/mg/metro/sites/default/files/growing_tomatoes.pdf.   Regarding when to plant outside, it says Transplant when plants are 10 to 15 tall and soil temperature is 60F, usually in June. Im not sure if youll have success bringing your plants back inside, or if youll need to start over later with new plants. Even seasoned gardeners get excited and plant too early, then have to start over because we misjudged the chance for a cold-snap.  A site that beginning and experienced gardeners find useful is the Oregon State Extension Gardening home page, http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/. Youll find tips and monthly gardening calendar links on the right. In about the middle is a search box. Try season extenders for some articles about how to plant early and harvest later in our short growing season.  There is a lot of gardening information on the web and youll want to focus on advice for local gardeners. I wish you the best with your garden.

## 2008_Oregon

  - Good day, and thank you for submitting an inquiry to Ask an Expert about planting tomatoes.     Tomatoes require consistently warm temperatures of 50F to 55F after they are planted into the garden. As a result, most folks wait until the end of May or even into early June to do so. If planted outdoors prior to that time, you will need to rig temporary protection to keep them reasonably warm.    Growing your own (Oregon State University) provides an overview about growing vegetables, including everything from preparing the soil to growing in containers. (http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/21092) Notice that page 7 details planting dates for tomatoes and much more. In that chart, the Portland area is in Region 2. Its useful to know that youre most likely to be successful with tomatoes in our region if you plant a kind thats said to be early.    Enjoy your garden!

  - Sometimes this can be due to lack of nutrition (in addition to symptoms on older leaves, young leaves are starting to come out yellow or white). A simple way to check this out is to water it with a fertilizer solution and look for response in 48-72 hours. If younger leaves appear to green up and new leaves appear normal, then you have found and solved the problem.  If you are seeing white spots then it may be thrip damage with the pest probably coming from the greenhouse. Plants will probably outgrow once the weather warms. You can spray the underside of the plants to remedy.    One other common cause of white areas on leaf tips or whole leaves at this time of the year is cold or frost damage. The plant may recover from such damage, but if the damage is severe the plants will not survive, or take too long to recover.    If the plants dont improve then I would suggest taking one of the plants to your locale extension office in Venango County located at     867 Mercer Road Franklin, PA 16323  Phone: 814-437-7607Fax: 814-432-7123VenangoExt@psu.edu  Office Hours  Monday-Friday 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.

## 2158_OutsideUnitedStates

  - It looks like you have blossom end rot.  This is a physiological disorder that is not caused by a pest or disease but rather is due to low levels of calcium in the fruit.  Control of blossom end rot is dependent upon maintaining adequate supplies of moisture and calcium to the developing fruits.    Symptoms can occur at any time during fruit development and are apparent one the end of the fruit opposite the stem.  In the beginning you will see a small water soaked spot appear which enlarges as the fruit develops.  Over time this will usually darken and turn leathery.  All of this occurs because alarge amount of calcium  is needed for normal cell growth.  During rapid fruit growth if the cells do not get enough calcium, then the fruit doesn't grow correctly and blossom end rot occurs.  The low levels of calcium may be due to low levels in the soil, drought, excessive moisture or fluctuations between high and low levels of water.  All of these reduce calcium uptake in the plant.    Making sure you have adequqte calcium in your soil is a good first defense, so make sure to get a soil test and add nutrients as recommended.  Also, when you plant tomatoes early in cold soil blossom end rot is likely to develop on the first fruits, with the severity of the disease often subsiding on fruits set later.  So, planting tomatoes in warmer soils helps to alleviate the problem.  To help limit water fluctuations having irrigation is helpful.  Mulching of the soil is often helpful in maintaining adequate supplies of soil water in times of moisture stress.   Here is link to a fact sheet from Cornell University of blossom end rot as well. http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_BlossRt.htm

  - There is no emprical evidance that companion planting accually does what people claim it will do. Tomato hornworms have not been a major problem ever since the European paper wasp became established in Colorado; these wasps eat tomato hornworms. Tomatoes need good quality sunlight to ripen. It is possible that the tomatoes you grew set way too late in the growing season and did not have enough time to mature.

  - Using plastic mulch with your tomatoes is a wonderful way to help reduce weeds in your field/garden. However, you didn't mention anything about pairing it with a drip irrigation system and that is necessary for optimal production. I would strongly recommend that when you are using plastic mulch. I found a wonderful fact sheet from New Mexico State University on Commercial Vegetable Production with Plastic Mulches (http://aces.nmsu.edu/pubs/_h/H245.pdf) that might also be of assistance. In that they discuss also the various colors of plastic mulch available. While black is the most common, remember that it will absorb the heat and so will be very warm in the summer. You might want to consider white or silver.

Because of our regions generally mild climate, the tomatoes most likely to grow and produce best are those said to be early, a word which often appears in the plants name. Also look for those developed by Oregon State University, as they do best with our generally cool nights.Among those that come to mind are Oregon Spring and Siletz. http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/osu-develops-tomatoes-especially-pnw-gardenersLegend is among the few tomatoes said to be resistant to late blight. Some gardeners say flavor is lacking. http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/node/469     That said, suggesting a flavorful tomato for another person is tough. According to a blind tasting of tomatoes held some years ago by a wholesale seed grower, its not possible to determine a best tomato overall because a persons preference is strictly in their own taste buds.    Some answers to your questions can be found in Oregon State Universitys Vegetable Variety Trials of which, the most recent is for 2010. http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/20930/em8777-10.pdf     You may also want to review the earlier trial reports. http://extension.oregonstate.edu/catalog/details.php?search=vegetable+trials&amp;submit.x=-222&amp;submit.y=-299   Growing Your Own is also likely to be useful.

  - Thanks for your question. We needed to route it to avegetable specialist to get the best answer possible.This looks like herbicide residue. You mentioned youused compost or hay mulch, and more than likely that hay came from a field that was sprayed with Grazon.   Other possibility is 2,4-D (weed killer)drift.  If you or his neighbor used 2,4-D on the lawn or he used compost in his garden that might have had treated weeds.    I have been seeing a lot of this damage.

  - That's not disease symptoms but feeding damage from the caterpillar stage of an insect, mostly likely from armyworms, either the Beet Armyworm (Scientific name: Spodoptera exigua) or the Western Yellowstriped Armyworm(Scientific name: Spodoptera praefica). Of the two, it's most likely to be the Western Yellowstriped Armyworm.Biological control and include sprays of Bacillus thuringiensis (Dipel, Thuricide, along with others). Sevin or Malathion is also effective but check dayys-toharvest interval on label.Very remote possibility that it may be from the caterpillar stage of the tobbaco hornworm but the feeding damge does not look to be.Look carefully for evidence of worms (may not readily visibel). Could lay a white sheet or poster board unser the plant...shake plant well then watch to see if caterpillars fall down.Hope this helps,

  - Thank you for contacting the Cherokee County UGA Extension Office and Master Gardeners concerning problems with your tomatoes. While I couldnt tell exactly the condition of your plants from the photos, the affected areas do not appear to match the usual disease problems we have with tomatoes in our area. I have included a link to a good UGA paper on common diseases in tomatoes. Has anyone sprayed a herbicide like Roundup near the plants? Tomatoes are exceptionally vulnerable to glyphosate, the main active ingredient in Roundup and many other herbicides. The new leaves are most susceptible and will show affects first. I have also included a link to the UGA publication on growing tomatoes in Georgia. Please contact us if you have additional questions.  http://www.caes.uga.edu/applications/publications/files/pdf/B%201285_3.PDF  http://www.caes.uga.edu/applications/publications/files/pdf/B%201271_3.PDF

## 3354_Maryland

  - Heirloom tomatoes taste so good that all the energy we put towards growing them is worth all the hassles we face while they mature. I have talked to a number of growers this spring and many have noticed that the Colorado Potato bug totally defoliated the majority of their early tomatoes but they also saw the CPB during the day. This time of year it is often the young cutworm (grey, black or brown) that climbs up the stem and eats the leaves at night. The older cutworms do take the plants out at the stem but the young ones go for the tender foliage. During the day they crawl back down to the ground and burrow into the ground near the stems of the plants. Check around the base of the plants to see if there are any insect burrows. Because you mentioned that the plants were defoliated at night, I think that the culprit may be the young cut worms. Before planting more, be sure to make a collar around the tomato plant out of aluminum foil. Place the collar about 2-3 inches from the tomato plants to keep the cutworms at bay.http://hgic.umd.edu/_media/documents/hg56.pdf

  - It appears from your photo that the scarring is only on the underside of the stem, and generally not on the leaves?If this is so, we wonder if it is perhaps abiotic damage. That is, not caused by a pest or disease, but something like weather.... Is this stem one that could have been superficially injured/scarred when lifted by wind and rubbed against the edge of the planter?We also would review how often you are fertilizing this plant. Generally we recommend fertilizing tomatoes at planting and again at bloom time. It may be that you are fine with that product if it has very low levels of nutrients, but read the label to be certain.cm

  - I have taken a careful look at your photo and can not determine precisiely what the problem is with your tomato plant. It does look a little like a fungus diease, but there are indications that nutrtional issues may also be involved, or possibly there are some mealybugs on the underside of your leaf.At this time of year there are a number ofpests and problems with growing tomatoes due to increased humitidy, which is why we genrally do not recommend growing tomatoes in the Florida summertime. I can not recomend any pesticides,organic or not,until the causal agent is identified. I can suggest that the leaves of the plant not be allowed to get wet, rather the plant needs to be atered from the soil below.I would hightly recommend that you take a sample AND photos to your local County Extension office for a close examination.

  - There are a number of fungal and bacterialdiseases that may affect vegetables. You can review the symptoms of some of these which affect tomatoesat:http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-0797/ANR-0797.pdfLaboratory tests may be the only way to definitively idententify which disease (or diseases) you are dealing with. Prevention is key, but since you already have a problem, Consider these steps:1. Plant only highly-resistant varieties. Buy seeds and plants from reputable dealers.Do not save seeds or tubers (potatoes) from food purchased at grocery stores.2. Provide even watering, especially as the seasonal temperatures rise. Over watering can create as many problems as under watering.3. Try to keep the foliage dry when irrigating or watering.4. Clean the garden bed of all plant debris including foliage and fruits. Hot composting will usually kill any pathogens.5. Rotate your crops, preferably over 3-4 years. Do not plant solanaceous crops in the same soil more often since pathogens can build and live many years. This includes tomatoes, potatoes, egg plant and peppers.Finally, if it appears you have a serious soil pathogen, it may be necessary to create new beds using fresh, clean soil. Some fungal diseases affect a wide variety of plants, and the only "cure" is to avoid putting any susceptible plants in the affected soil.I hope this helps.

  - This looks like sun scald on tomato. The plants should have been hardened off before planting outdoors. That is putting the plants out for one to two hours a day for one day. Then two to three hours a second day. Three to four hours the third day until you have the plants out for a full eight hours in a day. Then put them out for a day and over night. Then plant them. These look like they went from greenhouse or indoor growing directly outdoors. They will likely recover from this.

## 3592_Ohio

  - Without a picture of your tomato leaves, it is hard to determine the exact cause of a "sunburn" look. Since you just planted the tomatoes, I assume you mean just the leaves of your tomato plant look sunburned. Leaf-burn or scorch generally indicates root injury, quite often caused by heavy  amounts of fertilizer applied too near the roots. This injury often results in  browning and die back of the ends and margins of the leaves. Other possible  causes are root injury caused by nematodes, insects or physical injury by  cultivation. Also overwatering or underwatering along with diseases might cause  leaf-tip burn.Tomato plants need to be hardened off before planting in bright sunshine. Its best done in four stages, with young tomatoes 4-5 days in each spot.1. bright shade with no direct sun.2. bright shade with an hour or two of direct sun3. bright shade with 2  3 hours of direct sun4. Full sunshineHere is a link to a Fact Sheet describing many tomato problems including leaf scorch http://www.hgic.umd.edu/_media/documents/hg56.pdf

## 3600_Texas
* askextension_tomato/3600_Texas
  - Dear Gardener,Thank you for contacting Bonnie Plants. Yellowing on the older leaves is commonly from a nitrogen deficiency which can be the result of overwatering. Most vegetables only need an inch to an inch and a half of water a week from either rainfall or irrigation. If in a container, water them when the top inch and a half or so of potting soil becomes dry to the touch. It is best to water in the morning at the base of the plant, keeping the foliage dry, to prevent some disease problems. Mulching around plants helps conserve moisture, keep weeds down, and prevent some disease problems by preventing splashing up onto the leaves.

## 3659_Arkansas

  - You can pick the blooms off if you want to get the plants larger before they begin to bear fruit. I would say the minimum size for a container for tomatoes would be a five gallon pot. While they will grow in a smaller container, they dry out so quickly in the heat of our summers.

## 3718_Colorado

  - Early Blight is more of a plant tissue problem than a soil problem. Dropped leaves are the source of the disease for the following years. Sounds like you are doing a lot of things right to control early blight. In Missouri, we battle early blight, too. There is a Colorado publication on identifying and controlling tomato problems:Here is a clip from that publication:Early blight(Alternarialeaf spot)is caused by the fungusAlternaria solani. Symptoms become prevalent during the hotter months. This disease produces brown to black, target-like spots on older leaves. If severe, the fungus also attacks stems and fruit. Affected leaves may turn yellow, then drop, leaving the fruit exposed to sunburn.Sanitation is the best control. Remove all diseased plant tissue on the ground, as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris. Do not plant tomatoes in the same place next year. Space plants farther apart to improve air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation. If the infestation is heavy, sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection.Septoria leaf spotis less common in Colorado than early blight. It, too, is a fungal disease. Characteristic symptoms are white or gray spots on leaves, surrounded by a black or brown margin. Control is similar to early blight.The recommendation of sulfur applications is mentioned. We sometimes uses sprays called Lime-Sulfur or Bordeaux mixtures. Both contain sulfur compounds and have a long history of safety. Most garden centers will have one or both spraymaterials. they have been used a long time in fruit production to control fungal diseases.

## 3743_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/3743_Michigan
  - If the leaves are yellowed, it could be a couple of things. It could be that the soil is deficient in nitrogen. This could happen because you have not fertilized them or the soil had so much water go through it that the nitrogen was leached out.It could be that the amount of water has forced the air out of the soil. Air getting into the soil pores is necessary for roots to be healthy. Roots are involved in respiration which means that roots take in air, use the carbon dioxide and make oxygen. If they cannot because the pores are filled with water, the plants could yellow. It is much more likely with loam or clay soils and not as likely with sandy soils...but it can happen.Or, leaves could yellow if they were moved to the garden from the house or a greenhouse without acclimating them. This is called hardening off. It is a process of introducing them to the bright sun gradually over a week or two. If this is the problem, some of these leaves could turn brown and fall off from too much sun.Thse are three possibilities. You will have to decide what fits your situation. You might need the soil to dry out or if it is not too wet, fertilize lightly. Or if it is sun, look at the top of the plant for new, smaller, darker leaves being produced. These are the sun leaves that are needed for the garden.

## 3800_Texas

  - Manure/stable bedding(composted or fresh) can carry herbicide residue, because picloram herbicide is labeled for broadleaf weed control in coastal Bermuda pastures and the residue passes in the urine. Symptoms are upward curling of leaf margins. Tomato is probably more sensitive than squash, but I would expect some squash symptoms if this were the cause. Symptoms in your photo don't seem to fit this as cause.Symptoms are reminiscent of accidental herbicide exposure, which may have drifted to the site from some distance away. Most common would be nearby right-of-way treatments.Another possibility: Beet curly top virus, vectored by leafhoppers or other virus. Dense plantings may reduce risk some over widely spaced plants. Row cover fabric over cages may reduce access by insects that carry viruses.I suggest sending a few samples (whole plants) to Texas Plant Disease Diagnostic Lab in College Station for further examination.

## 3808_Texas

  - The most common tomato issue in 2013 was the periodic cold and/or windy weather after transplanting, causing stunted plants, downward curled leaves, and some leaf necrosis. Plantsoften never recover fully once warm weather prevails.Row cover fabric around wire cages provides some protection from wind and cold.You may also have spider mites and this was a frequent issue in 2012, and neem oil is about as good of a treatment that the homeowner can use. I suggest that you submit representative samples to Texas Plant Disease Diagnostic lab in College Station forconfirmation.

## 3968_Colorado

  - Plants absorb nutrients required for growth and development, directly from the elements or chemical compounds in the soil. Plants can also use these same elements/compounds of they are on plant leaves or stems. They can't take complex chemical compounds found in organic matter or manure until they are broken down by soil microbes into simple chemical compounds. Nitrogen is absorbed in either NH4+ or NO3- forms.Phosphorus is adsorbed in the P203 form. Potassium is adsorbed in it's elemental ionic form: K+Zinc, Iron, Boron, Calcium, Magnesium, and other micro-nutrients are taken in like potassium in their elemental ionic form. All fertilizers including miraclegrow are mixtures of the chemical elements that plants can readily adsorb. When manure is applied to soils or directly onto plants (lawns), the plant nutrients are locked into proteins, carbohydrates, or fibers.. Soil micro-organisms feed on these complex organic compounds and eventually break them down into simple compounds that are then available for the plant roots to absorb. To the plant it really doesn't matter where it's essential nutrients come from. All they need are the nutrients in forms that they can absorb into their tissues for growth and development. I hope this helps.

  - Because of the cold wet weather we have had, you are lucky to be have tomatoes. Many farmers and homeowners have had to plant a second and a third time. Be sure to keep the soil mulched to keep the moisture even. Soil kept too wet and cold seems to cause this problem. The soil needs to be moist but not wet.  If the tomatoes are planted in a low area or poor draining soil, this will also be a problem.

  - Hi,Yes, day temperatures over 90 degrees F. and night temperatures over 70  degrees F. reduce fruit set in tomatoes. As few as 3 hours at 104  degrees F on two successive days may cause failure of fruit set so this week was a bad one for tomatoes.Splitting can be caused by overwatering when the fruit is ripe. Also by too much sun. Otherwise your methods seem fine.Peter

  - One non-chemical control method is to destroy eggs before they hatch or when they are very small. The eggs are barrel shaped and occur in neat clusters or rows on the plant leaves.A horticultural oil can be used if you'd like to try a less toxic approach. Or, you may use chemicals containing bifenthrin,permethrinor malathion. Make sure you follow the label prescribed waiting period from spray until harvest and wash the fruit in clean water before consuming.I'm also attaching a link to guide that may be helpful.http://harris.agrilife.org/files/2011/05/vegpests.pdfThanks for the question.

## 4211_Oregon

  - HI:It's not entirely clear what is going on with the foliage, but it looks like white spots? To be honest, at this time of the year it is not unusual for tomatoes to look a bit ragged around here. The basic problem is that they are tropical plants in origin and require heat for sustained growth and production. In late May and early June it can be fairly cool, so all sort of odd foliage problems crop up on these plants at that timer. As the weather remains consistently warm, the plants tend to start growing rapidly and these problems are much reduced, or disappear. I would look at the newest growth on the top of the plant-if it looks good then I would be inclined to say the plant is fine. Ensure that it is in full sun, fertilize appropriately and water consustently and the plant should be fine. If you would like to submit addition photos for clarification, please send them directly to me at neil.bell@oregonstate.edu.

  - It is not a disease or insect causing the round tomatoes such as Better Boy and Big Boy to not have fruit but the hot night-time temperatures is causing the pollen not to form correctly thus the embryo is not fertilized so no fruit. Cherry tomatoes have a much higher tolerance to the hotter temperatures so they can keep on setting while round tomatoes do not.

  - Upward leaf curl on tomatoes can be a clue to stress, or varietal characteristic. It is generally not too troubling. Your photo is out of focus, and we cannot tell for sure what is going on the other limbs.Twisting and abnormalelongation of leaves and stems can be an indication of herbicide injury. Some herbicides can travel for long distances and tomatoes are especially sensitive. If the herbicide 2-4D is the cause, the plants don't usually grow out of it.Here is a link to a photo that shows this: http://plantdiagnostics.umd.edu/level3.cfm?causeID=352 Take a lookto compareif this is what you are seeing.Here too is our IPM Tomato publication, which is very useful: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoes.pdfcm

  - A general browning is generally a large infestation of spider mites or some fungal disease. I can not really tell by the pictures as to what it is such as spider mites or fungal disease.

  - Hi Jacki,Thanks for the pictures, but is there a way to send the leaf one where it is not blurry? It's hard to tell what is wrong...I'm looking specifically at the leaves and petioles (attachment to the stem).Though the garden is organic, do you use any herbicides in your lawn area? Do your neighbors? It's not surprising they don't have fruit at this point...we went from spring to hot summer in a matter of a few days. On days above 90 degrees, the flower will abort and not be pollinated. It's probably been too warm. Moderate temperatures between 65-85 degrees are ideal. Where did you purchase the plants? The same place both this year and last year? Did you plant them in the same spot? Did you add any compost or manure last year or this year? Changed any cultural practices?

It discusses leaf cupping and twisting. There are multiple cause of leaf twisting.As far as watering. You should water with a slow rate of water at the ground or soil level, dont use a sprinkler or overhead water source, that will only cause problems. This time of year I like to water tomatoes 2-3 times a week. Water slow and deep. Watering to a depth of 6-8 inches by the plant is recommended. You can push a small rod into the ground to measure how deep you are watering.

  - That is not much information to go by but I will do my best. You have eliminated any soil issues by starting with new soil, sterilized pots and disease resistant varieties. I am assuming these are grown in pots on a patio? Issues that could arise are salt build up from fertilizer, poor watering practices and others. Ask them a few more questions about their cultural practices. The one that really comes to mind is to find out if they have a lawn service that is spraying their lawn (or a neighbors lawn) on a regular basis. What they spray is a combination of fertilizer and 2,4-D. Tomatoes are extremely sensitive to 2,4-D and just a little drift will curl their leaves.A picture might help if you could send it.

  - Thedescription of your tomato plantsis a common complaint fortomatoes that have received too much nitrogen. Has a soil test been taken inthe area? Tomatoes that have too much nitrogen will be dark green, have excessive foliage, and few (if any)blooms. If the plants have been overfertilized, any pruning at this point will be of little help. Tomatoes are medium feeders and should be fertilized based on a soil test report. If no report is available, you should fertilize lightly (2 tablespoons of 5-10-10 per plants) at planting. When the first tomatoes are about the size of a quarter, sidedress with a tablespoon of 10-10-10 per plant and again every 3-4 weeks throughout harvest.The University of Georgia's Extension publication, Georgia Home Grown Tomatoes, will provide additionalinformation: http://www.caes.uga.edu/applications/publications/files/pdf/B%201271_3.PDF.

  - This question was answered by Michelle Wallace, Durham County Horticulture/Agriculture Agent.Thank you for your question. Tomato hornworms can be very destructive-very quickly, Ify you dont mind handpicking them off  that is very effective and safe. However, if they are in abundance, use BT (Bacious Thermongensis) it is marketed under several different products in both liquid and dust form. Dipel, for example is one such brand name. Hornworms covered in parasitic wasp eggs are doomed to die. Just remove them from the garden. Un-ripened tomatoes can result from the plant not getting the indicator to ripen. You can ripen them off the vine as you mentioned and the newspaper method does work.There are 2 factors that cause tomatoes to ripen:1. Temperature  the optimum temperature is 68-77 degrees F. Tomatoes do not produce the pigments needed to ripen when temperatures rise above 85 degrees2. Ethylene (hormonal gas)To ripen off of the vine:Place mature green tomatoes in a shallow box with straw where the temperature is 55-70 Degrees F. It will take 3 to 4 weeks.

  - Typically, tomato plants benefit from a side dressing (application during production) of nitrogen to keep them vigorous and productive. Couple things could be going on; perhaps too much N made them too vegetative and your course of action at the moment is the correct one. Some varieties do not respond as well to high N rates as others; modern hybrid tomatoes often will continue to bloom at high rates than some older hybrids or heirloom varieties. Finally, except perhaps for cherry tomatoes, once daytime temperatures start hitting the mid-nineties (and night temps remain above the lower 70's), even if they do bloom, they typically will not set fruit under those conditions. If however you keep the plants healthy until temperatures moderate, then they will begin to set fruit again at that time.

  - Hello,Yes, it is possible to test well water and ditch water. In our Powell area salt concentration in the water can be detrimental to many plants. Of course, it may be a pesticide of some sort as well. I would start with a water test first that will give you the dissolved salt level. Pesticide tests are expensive.Testing water requires some special handling and quick timing. Water samples need to be at the laboratory no more than 24 hours after sampling. Samples need to be taken according to the lab's specific directions, using their containers.Two laboratories you may try are:Precision Analysis, (307) 856-0866, www.precision-labs.comWyoming Department of Agriculture Analytical Services1174 Snowy Range Rd, Laramie, WY 82070(307) 742-2984, EMAIL: aslab@state.wy.us

  - Good afternoon,   To make sure I have the facts correct, your tomato plants look healthy and are producing a lot of blossoms, then the blossom dries up and the plant does not set fruit. Tomato pollination is temperature dependent. Too cold or too hot temperatures the plants will not set fruit. As stated in the CSU publication  GardenNotes #717: If nighttime temperatures drop below 55% F, pollen fails to develop and flowers that open the following in morning will not set fruit If daytime temperatures reach 900 F by 10 a.m., blossoms that opened that morning abort. The following link will take you to this publication, page 6 talks about pollination and summer temperatures: http://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/717.pdf    Since this problem is caused by temperature this is not a factor you can control. Since the plants are healthy they should produce more blossoms and then set fruit.     Hope this information is helpful.    Linda

  - Photos would really help us to provide a better answer.....you can upload photos.Your description sounds like this heirloom tomato may have psyllid injury or one of several viruses that can affect tomatoes, possibly Curly Top virus or Cucumber Mosaic virus. Viruses are vectored (transmitted) by various insects that feed on infected weeds, then move the virus to tomato. If most leaves are badly shriveled, contorted or deformed it would be best to pull and discard this affected tomato plant.See also: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.html

## 5524_Indiana

  - Tomatoes are self-pollinating, but the blossoms need to be agitated in order for the pollen to fly off the anthers and onto the stigmas. In the garden/farm field, wind does this quite nicely, but in the greenhouse, high humidity and a lack of wind can prevent pollination.If you don't already have one, get some large oscillating fans and set them up in the greenhouse. You don't need to blow the plants over, but you do need enough of a breeze to shake the plants (and the flowers) up a bit. You may also want to check your ventilation, to reduce humidity a little.In grad school, I had to manually vibrate each blossom cluster to get pollination in our small greenhouse. The greenhouse managers gave me a tool that had been originally purchased at an "adult store." Rather disturbing...but it did work.

  - This is called blossom end rot.Blossom end rot is caused by weather that is too hot, too cold, too wet or too dry;  which has been our weather for the last two months.Each variety is different as to how it reacts to the weather conditions.Cure:  moderate the water so the soil is moist but not wet.  Adding calcium or lime helps to slow down the the blossom end rot.In rare cases, this is called soft rot, where the bottoms have been slightly damaged and the bottoms will rot. With BERot, the end become leathery. If soft rot, remove the affected fruits.

## 5607_Colorado

  - Hello,Thank you so much for the great photos. Yes, it could definitely be TSWV. The only way to know for certain would be to have your plant tested for virus at the CSU Plant Diagnostic Clinic:http://plantclinic.agsci.colostate.edu/Dr. Tamla Blunt runs the clinic and can do the testing for you. It's an easy test, but does require fresh tissues. You will have to contact Tamla for prices.If you prefer not to do that, the best thing to do is remove the plant and throw it in the trash. Once the host (the plant) is gone, the virus cannot be vectored to other plants. But the longer you leave it in the garden, the greater the chance that thrips can spread the virus.Here's information from CSU:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02947.htmlDo you know the cultivar? Have you checked to see if it is a resistant one?Honestly, if you have 10 plants, and if they are heirloom or not resistant to TSWV, it may be in your best interest to just remove it and not get it tested. Thrips can complete their lifecycles really quickly. The problem may worsen. But if you want to know for certain, definitely get it tested.

  - The spotted leaf on your tomato is the key clue to septoria leaf spot. It could also possibly be early blight, a fungal disease, but many varieties of tomatoes are resistant to that. In either case, the solution is to start prevention early. When you plant, lay 3-4 layers of newspapers in an overlapping mulch under and around the plants. This is because these diseases overwinter in soil and spores splash up by rain or irrigation onto the lower leaves first, then get splashed up higher and higher.. So, when you see spots on lower leaves, immediately pull off that infected leaf. If the infection gets going, you can spray with a fungicide containing chlorothalonil. Copper spray is also used by organic gardeners. ECN

  - Hi-We have seen a lot of this issue in our area due to the extremely wet conditions. This week is forecasted to dry out, which should help to reduce the amount of spread. Clean the worst leaves from the plant and throw them away. Wash your hands after handling the spotted leaves. Clean clippers or any tools with 91% alcohol to prevent the spreadof the pathogen.You are more than likely dealing with a fungal or bacterial spot/wilt issue. There are many fungicides on the market labeled for vegetable crops. Begin to apply. Read the label for all proper mixing, handling, and spraying instructions. There are also copper based fungicides on the market that are OMRI approved (organic production). Do you have a mulch over your soil? If not, think about adding a layer of straw, grass clippings, or compost to your soil. This may help to prevent the soil from splashing up when it rains. It will keep your leaves and fruit cleaner. Make sure to rotate your vegetable crops. Tomatoes should follow a 3 year rotation. Septoria Leaf Spot has been the most common issue I've seen this season. Here is a publication: http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/450/450-711/450-711_pdf.pdfTo determine your exactissue,please bringa full plant into your local Virginia Cooperative Extension office.

  - Robert,I have some thoughts but it is easier to make a diagnosis on something like this with an actual sample in front of you. If you would like to bring one in we would be happy to look at it. An overall picture of the plant would also help. Our office is on the County Fairgrounds (9755 Henderson Rd. Brighton) and someone should be around to the receive the sample M-F 8:00am-4:30pm.That said, there a few things that might be going on. The leaf curling you are seeing might be a water related issue- too much or too little water could lead to such symptoms. It could also be a viral issue there are several common viruses that tomatoes can get which lead to leaf curling including curly top virus and tomato spotted wilt virus. If the plant is infected with either of these viruses it should be removed from the garden. There is no cure and it could potentially spread to other health plants.It is hard to say from the picture but the tan spots you are seeing are likely the result of flea beetle feeding. While such feeding can slow plants down normally they are less bothered by it as they get a little larger.Here is a really good factsheet on diagnosing tomato issues which you might to go through:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.pdfAgain feel free to bring in a sample or let me know if you have any other questions.

  - The length of time needed in a water bath canner varies. If you are canning crushed tomatoes, it is 35 minutes for pints and 45 minutes for quarts. If they are whole or halved (packed in water) it is 40 minutes for pints and 45 minutes for quarts. If they are whole or halved and no liquid is added, then pints or quarts would need to be processed for 85 minutes (both sizes of jars). Also, it is recommended that tomatoes be acidified before processing. You can acidify them by adding 1 tablespoon of bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon of citric acid per pint of tomatoes. If canning quarts, use 2 tablespoons of lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon citric acid per quart jar. The amountsalt you mentioned is fine.

  - It depends on what you mean by "blight". Are the LEAVES affected in any way - browning, spotting? Or are you just seeing the bottom 1/3 to 1/2 of green tomatoes brown/rotted? "Blossom End Rot" (BER) is a very common malady of tomatoes locally, caused by a temporary lack of calcium uptake. See photos.Many local native soils are high to excessively highin calcium so there is no need to add more. If you are growing tomatoes in containers with "artificial" soil composed of bark, peat moss, etc, thentomatoes are even morelikely to develop BER. Usually BER can be prevented or minimized by avoiding excessive fertilization and by supplying adequate and regular irrigation for tomatoes; this allows them to take up enough dissolved calcium from soils.See http://www.ext.colostate.edu/ptlk/1471.html and http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.html

## 5844_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/5844_Colorado
  - BLossom end rot is caused by insufficient calcium reaching the fruit as it is developing. Since calcium travels into the plant via water absorbed by the roots, the answer to the problem involves water.Mulch your soil to reduce water loss from evaporation. Water deeply and infrequently. Make sure the water you apply is reaching the rooting area of the plant. You can dig a bit into the soil a few hours following irrigation to determine if your water has moved far enough into the soil. You're looking for water getting 6-8 inches deep at least.There is no need to add supplemental calcium.

## 5965_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/5965_Colorado
  - It appears that your tomato has a nutritional problem, which is not that unusual at this time of year. I suggest you apply fertilizer.Some of the leaves look a little like one of the tomato viruses, but not enough for me to call it that from the photos. So try adding fertilizer first and see if there is improvement. I expect you will see that happen.For the blossom end rot, just make sure the plants are receiving regular water. Blossom end rot occurs when the water supply fluctuates. Calcium is carried into the plant through water uptake.When there's not enough water to carry the calcium into the plant as the fruit is developing, there is fruit cell wall collapse and the resulting blossom end rot. (Calcium is like the "concrete" of fruit skin.) You are welcome to send pictures to me at msmall@jeffco.us

  - Hi,Yes, unfortunately there are no current USDA guidelines for canning tomatoes with skins. The problem with grinding the skins with the tomatoes is that it changes the consistency of the tomatoes and makes the saucevery thick. As a result, when you process the jars, the heat does not penetrate into the center of the jar to kill pathogens. USDA has recipes for spaghetti sauce but this recipe needs to be pressure canned. Also, USDA doesn't haveguidelines for canning whole tomatoes withskins. The reason is that the temperature in a boiling water canner does not penetrate through the thicker skins. Also,most people do not like skins in their canned tomatoes so this may explain why there is no research. Another option is to freeze your tomatoes. I realize this depends on the amount of freezer space you have.I hope this information is helpful. Thank you for contacting eXtension.Sincerely,Alice MullenField Specialist, Food and Agriculture, Food Safety

  - I'm not able to find specific information on the timing of using the spray in regards to the flower's stage. Tomato flowers must be pollinated within 50 hours or they will abort and fall off, so I would use the spray at the beginning side of the flower opening. Here is more information on tomato blossoms and fruit set.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs1195Also, research shows that these sprays do help when fruit set is poor due to low nighttime temperatures but not when we are experiencing too high night or day temperatures. This time of year in Texas, it's just too hot for many of our varieties to set fruit. Let me know if you have further questions.

  - Not sure why they are not growing to at least 3.5 inches long but it may be possible that you think you have San Marzano but you have another tomato variety. If fruit size is small could be virus problems but you mention the plants look good so that is probably not it. All other tomatoes in your garden are growing fine so its probably not lack of fertilizer. So not sure.

  - Hello Jack,Sounds like it could be one of two diseases called early blight or another called septoria leaf spot. High humidity is the primary cause of both and we have had quite a lot of that.Prune off the leaves and branches and destroy. look for any leaves that have yellow circles with dark spots on them. These will be the next leaf to be effected-remove. Be certain that you water your plants at the ground level. No overhead watering. The fungus splashes up from the ground to infect the plant.  It is possible that the inoculate for these diseases (if they are the cause) are present in stakes you use if they are of wood and have been used for your tomatoes in the past. Below is a link to the Cornell site that will offer pictures and explanation for septoria leaf spot. the site will also help to diagnose other tomato diseases. I hope this will be some help in determining the problem.An exact diagnosis can be made from a sample of the leaves and branches. If you choose, bring a representative sample of the leaves, and branches to Schuylkill Extension office which is open Monday-Friday 8:30 to 4:30 The buildling is just off Rte 901 (Gordon Nagle Trail) in Pottsville.septoria leaf spothttp://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Septoria.htmearly blighthttp://pubs.ext.vt.edu/450/450-708/450-708.html

  - It looks like sun scald. Sun scald looks like white or pale sunken tissue on the fruit. If fruit is in direct sunlight, sun scald can occur. Sometimes rot-causing organisms enter the fruit at the place where sun scald occurred, and the fruit rots. Tomato plants with fewer leaves are more likely to get sun scald. If a plant loses leaves from a disease then the tomatoes are more likely to get sun scald.

## 6310_Oregon

  - If your tomatoes are growing vigorously and have plenty of leaves, removing a few probably won't hurt anything, but you don't need sun hitting the fruit to ripen.Tomato fruits go through several stages of development during their maturation          process. During early stages, the fruit continues to grow in size and          remains green, typically requiring 40-50 days. Once the fruit has reached          full size (called "mature green"), changes in pigment begin          to take place, causing the green to fade to light green then to the appropriate          pigments for that particular cultivar, be it red, pink, yellow or orange.                Ripening and color development in tomatoes is governed primarily by two          factors: temperature and the presence of a naturally occurring hormone          called "ethylene."                The optimum temperature range for ripening mature green tomatoes is 6877          deg. F. The further temperatures stray from the optimum, the slower the          ripening process will be. And, when temperatures are outside the optimum          range for extended periods, conditions may become so stressful that the          ripening process virtually halts.                At the same time, tomatoes do not produce lycopene and carotene, the pigments          responsible for ripe tomato color, when temperatures are above 85 deg.          F. So, extended periods of extreme heat cause tomatoes to stop ripening.So now that our temperatures have dropped to more normal levels, we should be seeing our plants going back to normal.

  - Jesse,Thank you for contacting the Cherokee County UGA Extension Office and Master Gardeners concerning tomato skin cracking in your garden. There are two types of tomato skin cracking, radial and concentric, and both result fromrapid fruit growth. Radial cracking generally occurs during periods of high temperatures (above 90 deg F) and extended periods of wet soil conditions. Concentric cracking generally results from cyclic conditions of moisture (wet/dry)and/or temperature (hot/cool). Maintaining even moisture control, avoiding heavy pruning, using crack resistant varieties, having a heavy fruit load on the plants, and shading of the fruit during the hottest part of the day can help prevent both types. I have included a link to an excellent UGA publication for commercial tomato growers that is valuable to anyone wanting to optimize their garden yield.

  - Tomato pollination is temperature dependant. Moderate temperatures between 65 degrees and 85 degrees are the best temperatures for growing tomatoes.If nighttime temperatures drop below 55 degrees, pollen fails to develop and flowers that open the following morning will not set fruit. Also, the first week of June had nighttime temperatures of around 42 degrees, which will completely stop the growth of the plant: which results in extending the total growth period.If morningtemperatures reach 90 degrees before noon,blossoms that opened that morning will abort. Tomato plants will also stop growing when temperatures reach 95 degrees.The fluctuation in the weather this year is most likely the reason for the trouble.I'm attaching somelinks to growing tomatoesalong the Front Range:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.pdfhttp://www.cmg.colostate.edu/gardennotes/717.pdf

There is no exception of clearing the dead plants and debris from the garden. I will give you few other tips:1) Use black plastic mulch2) If possible, put a plastic canopy to keep the leaves dry, do not spray water on the foliage but irrigate through drip or put hose down on the soil, no splash3) Preventatively use Daconil/Mancozeb on a weekly basis starting pre-bloom.

  - Yes you can plant tomatoes now but don't delay too many more weeks as there is a fairly small production window in fall after the heat leaves and the tomatoes can set fruit but before the first frost or freeze shuts things down. Garden center vegetables for home gardens are not GMO. Look for a good garden center in your area where they sell vegetable seeds and plants and ask whether they are carrying fall tomatoes as many do not. One fairly close to you is Kingwood Garden Center. There are most likely others as well.

  - Photo 1 - scarred fruits could be result of cold temperatures at the time when small fruits were formed after flowering. Scarring could also be from insect damage when fruits were smaller.Photo 2 - tomatoes can develop roots directly from stems. The "bumps" you see are root initials ("baby roots"). Tomato stems that rest on the ground are very likely to develop some root initials and then roots. But even stems several inches off the ground will sometimes develop root initials if stems become a little more horizontally oriented. Some tomato varieties may have more of a tendency to develop root initialsfrom stemsthan others.Photo 3 - this leaf browning could be from MANY possible causes - insufficient water, root damage, soil salinityand many others.Most area soils have sufficient to excessive magnesium, the mineral element supplied by Epsom salts. Unless you are growing tomatoes in containers of "artificial" soil it may not be beneficial to use Epsom salts.See also: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.html

  - From your description of the damage to your tomatoes and other plants, it sounds like the western potato flea beetle, Epitrix subcrinata is enjoying your vegetable garden.This flea beetle should not damage the tomato production of your plant unless you have an unusually high number of the beetles. If youdo not moved where you are growing your affected plants each year you should do so if at all possible.

  - Tomatoes that do not produce many flowers can come from several causes. Excess nitrogen can cause the plants to put a lot of energy into growing lush, green foliage at the expense of blooms. The extra moisture in the ground from all the rainfall this year is an added boost to the foliage growth but doesn't mean they will produce flowers. Without seeing the plants and doing a soil analysis, my guess would be over fertilization is the problem with your tomatoes this year. Manure is usually high in nitrogen and so are some formulations ofMiracle Grow. Before next season, I strongly urge you to have a soil test done to see what, if anything, needs to be added to your garden soil. Virginia Tech soil lab does an excellent job and test kits should be available from your local office of Virginia Cooperative Extension. You can also go to this link and get the information needed to take the soil sample and submit it to the laboratory at VT. It's not very expensive and I've found it is usually the best investment a gardener can make towards a productive garden.The VA Techpublication at this site is an excellent guide to growing tomatoes. The section on Causes of Poor Tomato Fruit Set should be informative for you.Good luck with your tomatoes. I know how frustrating it can be to have beautiful plants and no fruit! If you have additional questions, please use the reply feature within this email or call any office of Virginia Cooperative Extension for help. You can locate contact information for the offices here.Sandra

  - The holes on your green tomatoes are probably too irregular to be made by the tomato fruitworm (corn earworm), though they make similarly clean holes, so they are probably from a turtle, bird, or even slugs. The "pattern", we suspect, is coincidence. Do cut them open and look for any other evidence inside.ECN

  - The tomato plants in the picture are looking rather yellow and not too healthy. If the leaves on the bottom and middle are dying I would suspect a spider mite infestation or some fungal disease. The sprinkler may be adding enough leaf moisture to make this fungal disease worse. I would suggest some increase fertility, do not sprinkle irrigate and send healthy and unhealthy leaves to an Extension office near your area to see if it is a fungal disease because it is difficult to tell from a picture.

  - I don't recommend keeping tomato plants more than one year. They tend to build up pest and disease problems and it can be a challenge to get them through the winter, requiring cold protection to do so. Tomato plants are not too expensive and I think you will have much better results choosing recommended varieties and replanting at the recommended times each year. The following web site provides some recommended varieties for Harris County:http://harris.agrilife.org/files/2011/05/vegvariety.pdfThis next web site provides the best times of the year to plant:http://harris.agrilife.org/files/2011/05/VegPlantingChart.pdfThanks for contacting your Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension Office in Harris County.

  - The tomatoes are safe to eat. If you let tomatoes ripen on the vine, the blight takes over and the fruit will be blighted. You can pick them green and let them ripen on the  windowsill, which seems to slow down progress of the blight, and simply  cutting off the blight spots makes the tomatoes edible. The taste is  unaffected.

  - It's impossible to absolutely diagnose your problem but we can give you an idea of the possibilities.The first thing you should do is to pick/prune off any dead or significantly diseased leaves. There are diseases (bacterial and fungal) which can affect tomatoes. Some are fairly common and can be managed with careful cultural modifications.You may have a combination of factors, both disease andenvironmental stress,especially since you are growing two large plants in a container without a great deal of sun. Tomatoes generally want 6 or more hours of full sun per day. They also need a good deal of water, whcih is hard to do in a pot.Here are two publications which should be helpful to you: The first is IPM:Tomatoes, which is useful for diagnosing common problems: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoes.pdfandthe second is on vegetable gardening in containers, including a self-watering bucket, which is great for tomatoes: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG600%20Container%20Vegetable%20Gardening.pdfWith your limited sunlight, salad greens would be an ideal choice.cm

  - Hi, Do you know if the tomato is determinate or indeterminate? Normally you want to prune indeterminate not determinate.If they are continuing to grow they may be indeterminate and you can cut them back removing any new shoots. If you have not done any pruning to date you may want to remove some large stems letting those that already have larger fruit set continue to develop and ripen. However if the remaining tomatoes become fully exposed to sunlight from the pruning they may end up with sunscald. So be selective in your pruning. Here is a publication from Idaho with additional information.http://www.cals.uidaho.edu/edcomm/pdf/BUL/BUL0864.pdfThanks, Amy Jo

  - The stem of the plant in your photo look broad and flattened. Genetic abberation is a plausible explanation. Additional insect damage when the stem is developing can also caused those kinds of symptoms. Yet another reason is the reaction of the plant to chemical stimuli (i.e. nutrient imbalance issue).If you have multiple plants of the same variety but only have this symptom showing up on one plant, it is most likely that you had a plant with a genetic abnormally.IF this is occurring only on one particular variety, then it is possible that one of theother explanation proide above might be possible.

  - The supports should not be a problem. You can leave them in the sun to  kill any living fungus and you could wash them off with a bleach  solution just to be sure that they are clean of any spores which might  have landed on them.The spores can be formed in two ways. One is asexually and usually spread in the wind. If they do not find another host, they die. They do not over winter.If, by chance, you have two types on your plants which can mate and form oospores, the spores formed can overwinter in the soil. Removing all the plants minimizes the chance of this later type of reproduction taking place. I could not find any reference to whether the spored from this kind of mating can survive a fire so burning may kill everything.The plastic bag generates enough heat from the sun to kill much of the fungal growth. This may not kill all of the spores but they are contained and you can then trash the bag and any potential infection goes with it.Here is an article which will give you the concerns and the problems with dealing with this disease.http://www.longislandhort.cornell.edu/vegpath/late_blight_recent_future.pdfHere is the sight with more references on late blighthttp://www.longislandhort.cornell.edu/vegpath/photos/lateblight_tomato.htm

  - Without seeing the plants, it is difficult to tell if it is Fusarium wilt or some other kind of wilt on the cucumber. It may just be intense insect feeding as well. The tomato most likely has a combination of tomato spotted wilt virus, early blight and blossom end rot based on your description. TSWV is vectored by thrips and there is no control for this. The early blight is a fungus that becomes pathogenic when the plants are nitrogen stressed. It starts with yellowing leaves on the bottom of the plant with brown, concentric rings, then moves up the plant due to splashing water and wind blowing the spores of the fungus up.Fertilizing plants with nitrogen about mid-season will help with this since the plants are starting to fruit and spending all their energy doing that, so nitrogen is helpful. Blossom end rot is a calcium deficiency in the plant coupled with inconsistent watering. There is no cure other than making sure the plants are regularly watered and do not dry out between waterings. We generally have plenty of calcium in our soils to sustain the plants. They just need regular water to be able to take up the calcium.

## 7330_Maryland
* askextension_tomato/7330_Maryland
  - We can only guess at the actual cause of your tomato plants browning and wilting, but chances are, the plants are suffering from one or both of two fungal diseases that have been very widespread this year. Alternaria, commonly known as 'early blight' displays yellowing leaves with dark blotches in the yellow areas and begins at the bottom of the plant and moves upward through the plant. Septoria displays many small dark spots and it too begins at the bottom of the plant and moves upward. Both are airborne diseases and are made worse during cool, damp spring weather and warm humid nights in May and June. We have experienced all of these conditions this year, so the diseases are quite rampant.Should you experience these problems in the future, the best way to slow the disease is to simply remove and destroy the lower leaves as soon as you see the symptoms. It is also possible to prevent or suppress the diseases by spraying your tomato plants with a fungicide before the symptoms appear and continuing fungicide applications every 7-10 days throughout the growing season.LS

  - Have you seen birds do this? I ask because quite often ground squirrels will take a bit out of tomatoes and then leave them. Are the tomatoes left on the vine? If so, one idea that I have is to cover the tomato plans with bird netting to prevent the birds from getting at them. You would remove the netting when you needed to get at the plants to harvest the tomatoes. If the culprits are birds, you may also try to "scare" them by placing pinwheels that move in the breeze or sticks with mylar flagging attached to them near the plants. The movement of the pinwheels and/or flagging is sometimes scary to birds and will keep them away. Do not bother with taste repellents. Birds (with the exception of Canada geese) do not have a good sense of smell or taste so taste repellents don't work with birds generally.Hope this helps!

  - Both symptoms can be related to a lack of calcium which can be fixed by an extra dose of calcium right now. The black in the middle of the tomato is a kind of internal blossom end rot. This is a common problem with pasta sauce tomatoes. As the growing season slows down, the problem should abate on its own without any treatment, but we would recommend the application of calcium.

  - From the picture, it appears to be late blight. I would highly recommend that you take a sample into your local extension office to confirm. Late blight is a very fast moving fungal disease that can wipe out fields of tomatoes. If it is confirmed as late blight, in order to overwinter, it needs living tissue to survive in. A very, very thorough garden cleanup this fall should eliminate any bits of tomato plant. I have attached a link about late blight.pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/PDFS/ul215.pdfThis fungal disease does not affect zucchini, but I suspect that what you may be seeing is powdery mildew. Most gardeners accept the fact that at some time during the season, this fungal disease will appear on the squash leaves. You can look for resistant varieties, keep plenty of space between plants, and/or try a fungicide - most gardeners report very little relief from the use of fungicides.Your county extension office is at:214 Donohoe Road, Suite E                                                                Donohoe Center                                                                Greensburg, PA 15601Directions to our officeContactPhone:                     724-837-1402Fax:                     724-837-7613WestmorelandExt@psu.eduOffice HoursMonday-Friday 8:30 a.m. - 4:30 p.m.

## 7598_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/7598_Oregon
  - Hello, thanks for the question. I found lots about thishere is a paragraph on the subject I foundfrom the Oregon State University. Cracking is a physiological disorder caused by soil moisture fluctuations. When the tomato reaches the mature green stage and the water supply to the plant is reduced or cut off, the tomato will begin to ripen. At this time, a cellophane-like "wrapper" around the outer surface of the tomato becomes thicker and more rigid to protect the tomato during and after harvest. If the water supply is restored after ripening begins, the plant will resume translocation of nutrients and moisture into the fruit. This will cause the fruit to enlarge, which in turn splits the wrapper around the fruit and results in cracking. The single best control for cracking is a constant and regular water supply. Apply a layer of organic mulch to the base of the plant to serve as a buffer and to prevent soil moisture fluctuation. Water plants thoroughly every week  this is especially important when the fruits are maturing. Some varieties are resistant to cracking, but their skin is tougher. My husband answered a question from you about watering your tomatoes this time of the year earlier today. When you stop watering thetomatoesin the late summer to ripen tomatoes and then the rains come in the fallthey will split if they are susceptible to splitting. Based on the information I found you should mulch the soil around your tomatoes to slow the moisture loss after you cease watering. When you know a major rain storm is coming in the fall you can harvest the riper tomatoes to prevent them fromsplitting and finish ripening them inside.

  - It is always recommended to add bottle lemon juice 1 T per pint or 2 T per quart or you can use citric acid 1/4 teaspoon per pint or 1/2 teapoon per quart. It doesn't matter whether you use the boiling water or pressure canner method they still need to be acidified to assure that the pH is adequate to make the tomatoes safe.If you did not add any before you canned them you need to be sure that you boil them for 10 minutes or use them in something cooked that boils at least 10 minutes before tasting. Tomatoes are one of those products that falls near the borderline pH between high acid and low acid. Asian Pears and figs are other fruits that need to be acidified to make them safe.Good luck.Thanks for using Ask and ExpertNellie Oehler

## 7635_Michigan

  - Hi Steve, It sounds like radial growth cracks you are describing. Please see attached photo to verify this diagnosis. Similar to blossom end rot, cracking is associated with rapid fruit development and wide fluctuations in water availability to the plant. Fruit that has reached the ripening stage during dry weather may show considerable cracking if the dry period is followed by heavy rains and high temperatures. Our weather this summer has certainly provided these conditions. Tomato varieties differ considerably in the amount and severity of cracking that may occur.  As with blossom end rot, mulching and avoiding heavy applications of nitrogen fertilizer should help reduce fruit cracking.The tomatoes may still be eaten without risk. It the attached photo does not match what you are seeing on your tomatoes, please let me know.

  - Your tomatoes have been damaged by blossom end rot, abbreviated BER. This is a physiological problem rather than a disease.     The fundamental causes of blossom end rot (BER) are deficiency of calcium in the plant and moisture stress. Calcium uptake by the plant may be inadequate for any of the following reasons:   - There is insufficient calcium in the soil.   - Excess nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, or sodium has been applied as fertilizer.   - Very wet or very dry conditions interfere with the uptake of calcium.   - Windy exposure and/or very low humidity   - Growing in a container where root room is limited.- Some kinds of tomatoes are more susceptible than others, among them Roma.    The keys to avoid BER:  - Supply adequate calcium by adding lime to your soil every 2 to 3 years, the amount as directed on the package label.- Use only moderate amounts of fertilizer.- Plant in well-drained soil.  - Provide adequate irrigation to maintain evenly moist soil.  - When needed, temporarily protect the plants with a windbreak or shade on a suddenly very bright, clear day.    Additional resources for you:- Much of the above is adapted from Blossom End Rot. But please notice that the comment in that publication about using a calcium chloride spray is outdated information.

  - I don't know where you are located so I'll tell you from the perspective of KY (which would include most of the midwest and south). Tomatoes can get a number of diseases. They are worse in rainy springs and summers. We've definitely had a wetter than usual summer in KY.A couple of the diseases that affect tomatoes hit at the bottom first and work their way up the plant til the entire plant is killed back. Those are septoria leaf spot and early blight. There are a number of other diseases that can cause big problems for tomatoes so I would suggest taking some leaves (or the entire plant) to your local Cooperative Extension Service office and let them get you a diagnosis. That's the only way to know for sure.If you are unable or don't know about your local Extension service, you are more than welcome to send a picture and I can take a look.

  - The most common cause of tomato skin splitting is irregular watering. When the plant is dry and the fruit has formed, a sudden watering will cause the fruit to absorb too much water at one time which causes the skin to split. The best way to prevent this problem is to supply a constant supply of water.

  - The only time salt is required in canning is when you are making pickles. It is optional in tomatoes and other vegetables, so your tomatoes should be fine to eat, as long as you followed a research-based, tested recipe and processed them properly. Be certainyou added acid to them before you canned them. Tomatoes need additional acid (usually in the form of bottled lemon juice) to prevent botulism from developing. Pleaserefer toour publication Canning Tomatoes and Tomato Productsfor the full canning instructions.Here are some other helpful online resources for you: OSU Extension food preservation publications:http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/food-preservation  National Center for Home Food Preservation:http://nchfp.uga.edu/

  - Early blight is very common on tomatoes grown in Michigan because our climate often provides ideal conditions for this fungal disease. The spores become active in late spring/early summer when moisture is able to sit on the leaves for an extended period of time. These spores may overwinter in the soil.Steps you can take to help prevent this disease inlcude: Water the soil, not the plants using drip irrigation, soaker hoses, etc.  Mulch around the plants to provide a barrier that may reduce the risk of spores being splashed or blown onto wet leaves.  Prune the bottom set ofleaves on the tomato plants and remove them when you plant the tomatoes.Diseased plantleaves &amp; stems should be removed from the garden to help prevent re-occurrence. Plant the tomatoes far enough apart so there is good air flow and light allowed to reach the bottom of the plants. Tilling the soil in the fallcan expose the upper level of soil to the freezing winter temperatures which maykill these spores. Fungicides containing copper sulfate are organic options butare only effect as a preventative measure.Pleaserefer to this fact sheet for additional information:http://learningstore.uwex.edu/assets/pdfs/A2606.PDFThe good news is that early blight is generally not detrimental to the crop, unless the infestation is severe.

  - As the growing season nears the end, it is normal for the plants to begin to die back. Certain factors can add to the demise of your garden plants, also. One factor which will encourage the plants to quit producing is allowing the fruit to go unpicked. Picking the fruit as it ripens stimulates the plant to keep producing. Allowing the fruit to go to seed stimulates the plant to stop producing and to die back. Also, many fungal diseases are common on each of the plants you mentioned during this time of year.

  - The white dry area on the side of the tomato that was facing the sun is called sunscald. These areas may become leathery and dry. Sunscald is the symptom of excess sun exposure of the fruit. These areas are often invaded by decay causing fungi and bacteria that rots the fruit. Try to shade the developing fruit. Some tomato varieties are not prone to sunscald. Control leaf diseases and insects using recommended pesticides to minimize leaf loss. You can cover fruit with straw or shade plants with row cover.

It looks more like tomato mosiac virus even though the leaves of your plants apparently do not show the problem.  http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/PhotoPages/Tomatoes/Tom_Viruses/Tom_VirusesFS2.htm You can also visit our disease diagnostic page http://www1.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/fruitspots.html It is almost the end of the season so the important part will be sanitation. Make sure you clean up and remove all plant debris this fall and plant in a different area next year. You also may wish to try a different variety of tomato.

  - Could be 1 of 2 things. Either a microbial disease agent such as soil rot or blossom-end rot caused by an imbalance of watering (too much then too little) which leads to lack of calcium properly being transported. Plant varieties that are more tolerant to blossom-end rot and water more routinely and a little calcium in the fertilizer will help to prevent this problem.

  - Tomato spotted wilt virus is difficult to manage.Yes, it is caused by thrips. It's best to scout for the insects earlier in the seasonand take action against the thrips before damage is done. That said, these insects are tiny and difficult to control.Please see this fact sheet which contains more information on the subject:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.htmlYes, you can eat the tomatoes. The virus that is transmitted affects only plants, not humans. The more severely affected fruit may have a "blah" taste, kind of like tomatoes shipped north in the winter months.

## 8554_Minnesota

  - It sounds like you are seeing early blight, a soil born disorder. Once they have it there is no cure, it must be prevented. Do not allow the leaves to touch the soil or the soil to splash onto the leaves. Check http://www.extension.umn.edu/projects/yardandgarden/ygbriefs/p256earlyblight-pot-tom.html for more information.

  - Tomatoes with hard white tissue in the cross-wall and center of the fruit have a physiological disorder called internal white tissue. They often have few external symptoms. High temperatures during the ripening period are thought to trigger the symptoms. Maintaining a sufficient potassium fertilization program (soil exchangeable potassium (K+) level of 130 PPM in sandy loams) can reduce symptoms but may not eliminate them. Resistance to this problem varies with varieties. The following sites may be of interest to you.http://msucares.com/crops/comhort/tomatodisease/  http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs200It is best to avoid watering your tomato plants in the evening as that might allow the leaves to stay wet through the nighttime and that will favor fungal diseases.   Information on late blight may be found at the following sites.http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/3000/3102.html http://www.agriculture.purdue.edu/aganswers/story.asp?storyID=5496

  - Yes, processing times have changed, and they are longer. Processing timedoes depend on what type of tomatoes you are processing. Pints of whole orhalf tomatoestake 40 minutes; quarts take 45 minutes. Unseasoned sauce or crushed tomatoes take 35 minutes for pints and 40 minutes for quarts. Many recipes also indicate that you should add lemon juice to the jars. This ensures acidity and is an important step.

  - The problem with using blemished tomatoes is that the mold may impact the internal parts of the tissue, lowering the acidity. In general, we recommend that people do not use heavily infected tomatoes, even for freezing. If the blemishes were primarily surface blemishes that were generouslyremoved, and the product was thoroughly cooked and then frozen, it should be okay.

  - Being able to see the damage would make answering this question much easier. If you could furnish a close up photo, or better take a sample to your local Extension Office the identification and solution would be more accurate. For the Metro Area Extension office near you go to: extension.oregonstate.edu/metro/ The immediate action that you should take is to remove the tomatoes that are damaged. Also remove tomatoes that are on the ground under the tomatoes. Both will attract whatever is damaging your tomatoes.

  - Although the infection is not very severe, the tomato fruit in the photo appears to exhibit symptoms of bacterial canker.Learn more here: Bacterial Diseases of Tomatoeshttp://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Bacterial.htm#ClickAlthough some damage may occur, tomatoes are not among the plants preferred by Japanese beetles.Tiny black bugs on tomatoes might be flea beetles, but we can't be sure without seeing them or sharp photos. Flea beetles create small white spots on the leaves, but the damage usually isn't severe. Or, as you suggest, the bugs might be aphids. They come in many colors, including black. They move slowly and could appear to be dead. Aphids are capable of damaging plants when large numbers are present.  Overwatering damages roots and plants so affected lack vigor, but this seems not to be the case with the plants in the photos you sent.

  - Your tomatoes look really quite good. One of the dark spots may be due to a slug trying to get into the tomato and the little indentationmark on the other could be anything. It is hard to tell from the photo. If the leaves look good, you are lucky since it is nearing the end of September. At this late date, I wouldn't worry about any disease problems. If any leaves do look diseased, remove them and place them in the trash. Do not compost them.

  - The tomatos should be safe to eat, provided you used the proper processing pressure (if you have a weighted gauge canner). Woodbury County would be at an altitude above 1000 feet so the weight needed would be 15lbs of pressure. If you have a dial gauge canner 11lbs of pressure is needed.The tomatoes should be safe to eat, but you can boil them (and any product made from them) for 10 minutes before eating to ensure safety. If you have leftovers made from this product you would again want to boil for 10 minutes before consuming the leftovers. Please don't hesitate to contact us directly with further questions.

  - We do not have laboratory tested recipes for canning roasted tomatoes with onion and garlic. If you were to do it you would need to pressure process them for the onion time and acidify the tomatoes with 1T bottled lemon juice per pint and 2 T. per quart. I would also recommend adding water or tomato juice liquid so the product is not too dense for adequate heat penetration.

  - Hello and thanks for submitting your questions to eXtension online. I am the horticulturist with Texas A&amp;M AgriLife Extension in Fort Bend County.  The insect that is bothering you and your tomato fruit are leaf-footed bug, which is a family member (Hemiptera) of the green or brown common stink bug. And like their relatives, they too stink! Complete control of these insects is off the table, but there are some things you can do to keep their numbers down.1. Early morning, carry a bucket of soapy water in your garden and pick off the mature adults and give them their last bath. They are easy to grab in the morning, no so easy once the day heats up.2. The small reddish-orange immatures are easy to kill with a little soapy water spray, but you do have to make direct contact on the insect. As listed in the publication below, you can use horticultural oils. Also, pyrethrin, which is an organic insecticide, will give you better control than soapy water and easier on plants than oils.The adults are hard to eliminate with any chemical. Again, manual removal of the adults is your best bet. Once you've eliminated the young, you will be able to keep their overall populations to a minimum. And then get back to harvesting the best home grown 'maters. For your reference.http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/plant_pests/veg_fruit/hgic2218.htmlBest of luck and good day,Boone

  - I don't see that that is too much of a problem. I would not squeeze the juice out but just draining them should be ok as long as you add the appropriate amount of vinegar. If you want to be sure it is acid enough, substitute equal amount of bottled lemon juice for the vinegar and then you will be extra safe. You just don't want the salsa so thick that it will not process properly. Thanks for using Ask an Expert.

  - Without the addition of acid (lemon juice, citric acid, or vinegar), tomatoes are not acidic enough to be safely home-canned. You might try citric acid, available in powdered form in stores where bulk products are sold as well as some natural food stores. See page 5 of the following documentfor quantities:http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/sites/default/files/documents/pnw_300_canningtomatoesandtomatoproducts.pdf.You should be able to obtain bottled lemon juice with no preservatives or other added ingredients at natural food stores. It should be the standard acid level. We recommend against trying to test the pH ofproducts. There are problems with consistency and accuracy. Freezing is also an option. There is no need to acidify frozen products.

  - Unfortunately, the FDA recommends that any produce that come in direct contact with flooded water be discarded and not consumed in any way. The following link from OSU explains in detail: http://ohioline.osu.edu/anr-fact/pdf/0027.pdf. The assumption is that the produce likely came in contact with pathogens from sewage or animal manureand possiblychemical or physical contaminants. For some produce (like beet or winter squash) there arerecommendations for bleach disinfectant- but in the case of tomatoes, this would not be advised. I know it is disappointing to enjoy your gardening efforts-butit is the sad situation at this time.

  - Your tomato is showing the signs of herbicide injury. My first guess is that somehow glyphosate (ingredient in Roundup) has gotten on them in a small, dilute dose. Perhaps drift from a nearby application, or using a sprayer for herbicide and then using it for something to spray on the tomatoes are possible ways this happened. Other possible herbicides would be something used on the turfgrass or something used on any mulch that was applied around the tomatoes. If any of these are likely please respond and let me know which one you think it may be. The tomatoes are not going to recover and with fall slowing down growth and frosts coming I don't think the plants will be fruitful. You can pull them and plan on replanting next spring.Skip

  - Blight diseases are common and discouraging but there are some things that you can do to stay ahead of the game. You have already identified some good cultural practices. If you are able to rotate the planting areas this is great...just allow about 4 years for the spores to die off, and don't plant similar crops in that area (such as eggplants, potatoes, peppers or other solanaceous plants) because they will perpetuate the problem.One of the most important things you can do is to plant blight resistant cultivars. Another good practice is to mulch the tomatoes. This helps conserve water, keeps the soil evenly moist and prevents the blight spores from reinfecting the plants when water splashes up from the ground.Even though we can't control the rain water, when you use the hose do not sprinkle water on the leaves. A well placed soaker hose would be the best way to water your tomatoes....again to avoid splashing the spores up into the plants.Maintain good spacing between the plants so that they are well ventilated. A full-sun location is best.Keep that area - both the beds and the surrounding area free of weeds. Many weeds are a good harbor for blight spores.Tilling the soil should not spread the disease. Just don't translocate the infected soil into your uninfected planting areas. You can chose to use fungicides but they should be considered preventative, rather than curative. Be vigilant about the weather conditions that may be favorable for blight and apply the appropriate chemicals right away.Here are a couple of links that explain these two different blight diseases:http://www.extension.umn.edu/projects/yardandgarden/ygbriefs/p230lateblight-pot-tom.htmlhttp://www.extension.umn.edu/projects/yardandgarden/ygbriefs/p256earlyblight-pot-tom.htmlI hope this information is helpful.

  - If you look at the blossom end of the fruit and you can see a yellowish star pattern the the tomato has matured enough to continue ripening by itself. You just put them in a warm dry place Many like to put them on their window sill, and wait. You can turn them over periodically which might even out the ripening process. Those tomatoes that don't have the star you can still enjoy. There are many great recipes for green tomatoes!

## 10465_Illinois

  - Most of my references state to use mature green tomatoes for relishes, fried tomato, etc. I do not believe they would be toxic if picked or used in a more immature stage, but I do believe flavor or quality would not be as good. Definitely, immature green tomatoes won't ripen properly, and if they did, the quality would be very poor.If most of the fruit is white, except for the shoulders (top), I'd go ahead and try some of them. You might want to prepare and sample a small batch of these first, before going through the effort of cooking an entire bushel of them.

  - You can heat them if you make them high enough as to not let the heating source melt or cause a fire. Plastic tends to keep the heat in and the wind and frost off as long as the sun shines. Unless you want to try this all winter, adding extra heat may be somewhat expensive. Without seeing your immediate environment, it is difficult to make any absolute suggestions. You might want to find your local Extension and discuss this with them since they will be familiar with your area better than I am.

  - Thanks for the question. Some reasons for flavor loss could be the environment, soil conditions and even the variety of tomato. Taste is a matter of personal preference. Some tomato enthusiast only plant heirloom tomatoes. However, there are risks associated with production. Heirloom varieties are not resistant to diseases and viruses that improved varieties are made to avoid. I suggest planting a few varieties each year. Sungold is a great variety for our area. If you like sweet and small. Celebrity and Tycoon are also good varieties for the medium size.

  - There are numerous reasons for them to turn yellow and wilt. Check http://www1.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/diseases/#vegetable to see if you can match symptoms. Too much water will also affect them, but from the look of the plants I don't think that is the problem. Most problems are soil borne so you must mulch with something to keep the soil from splashing onto the leaves. Yes, there are many, many varieties. Yes, they will not set fruit if temperatures stay too warm, but they also have problems with cold temperatures by not ripening on the vines. You might also get a soil test since the incorrect pH can give you the small leaves. Remember it takes time for your plants to respond to changes.

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to multiple diseases in our area, though not any that are horribly unmanageable. (For instance, we commonly get early blight, but can usually get a decent crop of tomatoes anyway, unlike late blight, which we hardly ever get here, but which is highly damaging.) It's good that you discarded diseased remains out of the garden. You should also remove leaf debris from your stakes/cages.In general, it is not necessary to disinfect your stakes and cages, however.. It would cut down on the amount of disease inoculum present, but not to a great degree.Your best bet is to select clean plants to begin with, and aim for those which have some purported disease resistance.

  - Fertilizing tomatoes is recommended. Using a timed release vegetable fertilizer may improve the results. It is also important to know that temperature has a big effect on tomato production. If temperatures are over 80 F tomatoes do not flower and bees do not pollinate existing flowers. Temperatures last year probably had the most impact on the yield. I would try growing some cherry tomatoes and a mix of early and regular varieties to be as ready as you can for the unpredictability and challenges of weather here.

## 11543_Texas

  - Starting tomato seeds is usually a 6-8 week affair that allows for germination, thinning, growth beyond the two true leaf stage and hardening off. Typically, you backtrack that amount of time from your average last frost date to get an idea of when you can begin starting seeds. If you look at the frost maps on page 3 of thet Texas Home Gardening Guide [http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/organic/files/2011/03/E-502_home_vegetable_guide.pdf],you can get an idea of the date.If I'm reading the map correctly, it's the end of January - mid February depending on what part of the county you are in.

  - First, I am wondering if you have correctly identified the cause of the wilt. There are several problems that can cause wilt on tomatoes, and the recommendations are different, depending on which problem you have. This article from Mississippi State Extension describes some of the possible causes:http://msucares.com/lawn/garden/msgardens/05/050620.htmlOne additional problem that the article does not describe is walnut wilt: http://burke.ces.ncsu.edu/2012/07/tomatoes-or-walnuts-3/If you determine that you truly did have bacterial wilt on your tomatoes, you should try planting your tomatoes somewhere else in 2014. There is no practical way to treat the soil or infected plants. Here is a link to an article about bacterial wilt on tomatoes from Alabama A&amp;M and Auburn http://www.aces.edu/pubs/docs/A/ANR-0862/ANR-0862.pdfBest wishes for a great tomato crop in 2014!

  - Thank you for your question about choosing the right variety of tomatoes to grow in containers. One excellent cherry tomato is Sweet 100, but it is a large plant that will require a container of at least 5-gallon size and support along a fence or from asubstantial tomato cage. Alternatively, you can prune the plant as it outgrows your particular space. Being indeterminate, it will keep putting out new growth and setting new tomatoes for the entire season it remains healthy. Big Beef is a good choice of beefsteak type, and Big Boy is somewhat smaller but still a great tomato. If you will tell me specific problems you've had with tomatoes, I may be able to give you additional help. Please use the reply feature within the email since a simple reply will not get to me directly.   This publication from VA Tech lists vegetable varieties recommended for VA gardeners.

Some of this is Really technical, and some of them are a bit more understandable for those of us with Liberal Arts -or less-degrees.   ;-)http://www.sunmastergrowlamps.com/PAR_Watts.htmhttps://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/HGICeNewCovers/HGIC%20ENews%20Winter%202012_2013_finalsm.pdfhttp://www.hort.purdue.edu/ext/ho-14.pdfYou will find that there are a number of choices of bulbs, from plain old compact fluorescents, thru fluorescents to the newer LED's. While you might want to consider the energy costs of lighting, some of these bulbs do not have a "full spectrum" of light and although they may be bright, they may not contain the best "quality" of light for your new seeds. I hope this information helps you with your research. Good luck with your new tomatoes...spring is just around the corner, I promise!Please contact Aae again if you have further questions.

  - If there are obvious signs of spoilage, we recommend that cans or jars not be opened or handled. They should be carefully discarded. If the container is opened and there are signs of spoilage, it should not be consumed. The bulging can and spurting juice were signs that spoilage of some type has occurred inside the container. It is likely that this can has been stored somewhere hot for some time and set off bacteria growth in the cans.There should be contact information for the food processor on the container. They may have further information about the product and what might have happened. If you do start feeling ill, be sure to check with your physician. In the future, I would not open or sample any containers that show signs of spoilage.

  - Unfortunately, tomatoes and most vegetables that produce a "fruit" require at least 6 to 8 hours of direct sun a day in order to produce. If your particular location is close to that, you can enhance the light by adding a white fence or other light reflecting surface on the north side of the plants and possibly have some success. Small fruited varieties such as Sweet 100 cherry tomatoes would be your best option if you want to give it a try.Otherwise, I suggest you go with vegetables that we grow for their leaves such as spinach, lettuce, kale, or swiss chard. Root vegetables such as carrots and green onions will also produce in partially shaded areas.This publication from North Carolina State University gives some advice on specific vegetables that can be grown in moderate shade. I hope it helps. If you have additional questions on this subject, please contact me through the reply feature within this email. And thanks for using Ask an Expert.

  - Dear Joe,From the photos it is hard to tell whether this is one plant or several. There does not seem to be any other signs of disease (yellowing leaves, dead tissue, etc.) so I would guess the damage was caused by physical factors.Weight and wind can cause cracking, so it is importanat tosupport all of theheavy side branches as the plant grows.Sudden changes in moisture levels andtemperatures can also cause cracks in the stalks andthe fruit.. Try to water deeply and evenly when the top half-inch of soil has dried out. If the temperatures in the green house fluctuate, try to keep it steady by ventilating during the heat of the day, and covering the plants with a floating row cloth at night.I hope this helps.

  - Beet curly top virus is certainly a consideration; it could also be from insect or mite feeding.The damage you describe could also be from herbicide injury. Herbicide damage can appear on plants from a few sourcesincluding manures, residues in grass clippings and herbicide drift.Some herbicides, when consumed by livestock, pass right through the animal's digestive tract and into the manure. When the manure is applied to garden soil, it can thenbe absorbed by plants.You can also accidentally introduce herbicides into your garden fromgrass clippings/straw that have been treated with herbicides. Please see this publication which discusses herbicide injury in gardens:http://smallfarms.oregonstate.edu/sfn/f09HerbicideAnother possibility is that herbicide has drifted onto your garden from another location. Certain forms of common herbicides can vaporize and be carried by breezes/winds to other, non-target locations such as your garden.I suggest you do the bioassay suggested in the above publication, using some of your garden soil to determine if herbicide residues might be present. You can send plants to certain labs to be tested for herbicide presence, but it is very expensive. If the problem develops during the growing season again,you are welcome to bring it to the CSU Extension/ Jefferson County Plant Diagnostic Clinic located on the Jefferson County fairgrounds. We can examine it for mites and insects to determine if those might be the problem. We also can run a few virus tests, although for beet curly top virus, we would have to send it to the CSU lab. We also do not test for herbicide residue. There are fees involved with the testing.

Some paste types I have planted and like are:San Marzano Gigante (Ind.), Princepe Borghese (Det.), Cordova (Det.), and Jersey Devil aka Polish Linguisa (Ind.). there are a lot more out there. Keep good notes as to the growing season (heat or lack thereof, rain leading to disease, etc.) and results.As to other tomatoes, I generally plant Stupice for early tomatoes, Black Krim, Siletz, Peron, Cherokee purple, Valencia (orange), and Sungolds for cherry type. Experiment. Keep notes. Watch the ones that survive late blight if we get early rains (Black Krim will not).Hope this helps.

  - The short answer is to a failed attempt toavoid paying import taxes under the Tariff if 1833. Nix v Hadden 1893) was the court ruling that made tomatoes legally a vegetable and therefore subject to the tariff. Nix sued a customs official for fees charged on Nix's imported tomato. Nix claimed they were fruit, which was not subject to the tariff. Nix lost and, for legal purposes, was declareda vegetable.

  - Thank you for your question to Ask an Expert.Great idea to try to plant two crops per year in each bed to get the most out of your garden. If you plant peas now, they will take 7-10 days to germinate and then grow for about 60 days until first harvest. That would take you to mid-May and then peas continue producing for about a month. So, if you plan to remove the peas before they have totally petered out and plant the tomatoes in the first half of June, then your timing will likely work. Also, if you can plant the tomatoes in another location, you could plant carrots, beets or other crops after the peas are totally finished producing in late June or early July.Please let me know if you have any further questions

  - Tomato plants like consistent warm weather. The evenings in Boulder regularly become quite cool. The cool nights can delay the ripening of fruit. Never the less tomatos do quite well here andhome grown ones are much tastier than store bought. Delay planting warm weather plants until after Mother's Day. There are many varieties available in seed or at local nurseries and big box stores. The variety is a matter of personal taste and how you plan to use the tomatos. A local florist or nursery may provide some help in plant selection.Click on this link to read more about growing tomatos:http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/717.htmlHope this helps.

  - Hi,We first should identify which blight/s affected your tomatoes. There are three blights which could have caused damage on your plants either alone or in combination. The blights are early blight, septoria leaf blight, and late blight. We had a number of folks with tomatoes affected by septoria last year. Early blight is a fungus that over winters here and typically starts on the lowest leaves of the plant and slowly works its way up the plant. Septoria is also caused by a fungus.Late blight is caused by a water mold and does not overwinter here unless it has living tissue of a tomato or potato plant to survive on. The fact sheet goes into more detail on the life cycle. The following link takes you to our late blight fact sheet:http://pubs.cas.psu.edu/freepubs/pdfs/ul215.pdf The following link takes you to a fact sheet on septoria and early blight: http://learningstore.uwex.edu/Assets/pdfs/A2606.pdf Also, tomato disease management strategies: http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/NewsArticles/Tomato_Strategies_Fungicide.pdfPlease read the factsheets and if you need clarification or additional information, please let me know.

  - Good morning. First, you should get your soil tested. Tomatoes need a balanced fertilizer and if there are specific soil nutrient deficiencies you really can't tell unless you do a test. Forms and containers for these tests are available at local libraries and at the Fairlington Community Center in Arlington. Generally an excess of vine/leaf growth would indicate that there was too much nitrogen compared to other nutrients. Even though the test will not tell you the N in the soil, it will give you a recommendation for how much to apply this year. Second, anytime we see a lot of vegetative growth and not a lot of flower/fruit production we suspect that there might be insufficient light. Tomatoes will require a minimum of 6-8 hours of direct sunlight per day for good fruit production. Finally, if the top growth is just too much it sounds like you got a variety that is "indeterminate" Next time select a determinate or a plant that suitable for "patio" or "container" use. If you still need answers contact the Horticululture Help Desk in the Fairlington Community Center at 3308 S. Stafford St. Arlington VA 22206, it is staffed every day between 9-12 and you can send email to mgarlalex@gmail.com or call them at 703 539 9855Happy gardening!

  - The blossoms on your tomatoes are not pollinating for some reason, there are a variety of things that can cause this. Temperature can be a contributing factor, extreme temperatures can cause the blossoms to drop. Make sure that you plant tomatoes that are developed to tolerate hot weather. Humidity can also affect pollination. During real high temperatures and low humidity, it's a good idea to water the actual plant during the afternoon or evening. You need to thoroughly water every 3-4 days to promote root growthsoak soil 3-4 feet around plant. Please callme at (254) 559-2313 for additional information and a brochure on tomato gardening.

A soil test is essentially a fertility test. A soil test does not check for the presence of disease pathogens or contaminants in the soil. Gardeners can submit soil samples to the ISU Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory.

  - Hi there -Since the common tomato diseases (Early Blight, Verticillium and Fusarium wilt) are soil borne, crop rotation is an effective management tool. However, this may not be practical in most home garden situations, particularly since rotation allows no tomatoes, peppers, potatoes, eggplants, vine crops (cucumbers, squash, pumpkins, and melons), strawberries, or raspberries in the same growing area forat least four years. In a garden bed, moving the tomatoes a few rows to the left or right is not an effective rotation. So if you did want to plant tomatoes in your containers again, I would suggest replacing the soil. Ensuring proper drainage is especially important for containers. Here's a link to further information: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/717.html

Cover the jar using a paper towel and a rubber band, and then set it  aside. The mixture may produce an odor as it begins to ferment. 				  Within five days, the seeds should sink to the bottom of the  jar. Skim off any surface mold and then pour the mixture into a  strainer. Rinse the seeds well and spread them on a paper plate to air  dry. 				  Once they're completely dry, store the seeds in an airtight container in a cool, dry place.

  - It is not too uncommon to see purplish color on young early season plants exposed to cool weather. It is usually a nutrient issue, primarily lack of phosphorous. I also saw the bright yellow leaf which is sometimes anindicator of over watering. If watering a lot you could be flushing a lot of nutrients out of the soil and when this iscombined with not quite warm enough tomato weather you could have issues. Concerning brown spots, I really don't know. Fungal? Maybe? I would keep soil moist not wet. I wouldn't water every day but only as needed. Just finger check the soil. I know you applied corn meal around plant as an organic optionto deter fungal problems. I don't know if a fungus or mold is involved or just purely growing conditions and lacking nutrients. I would prepare my garden spot by adding 3 pounds of 10-10-10 fertilizer for every 100 square feet and plant my tomatoes. If they did'nt pull out of it, then start over. You don't need weak sickly plants that you have to nurse along. They'll never produce well and will be susceptible to disease and pest attacks.

  - Heres the secret to thick stems: The best way to keep seedlings from getting leggy is to place fluorescent lights 2 to 3 inches from the canopy of the growing plants. Fluorescent lights dont give off the heat that incandescent lights do, so dont be afraid to position them close to the seedlings. Keep in mind, youll need to have a way to move the lights up as the plants grow. When the tomatoes start looking leggy, transplant the seedling as deep as you can. Here's hoping for an early spring.

  - There is a bit of a conflict with your question.You don't like the taste of heirloom tomatoes, but these were the tomato varieties that were grown 50 years ago.Maybe your memories are playing a bit of a trick on you; what do you think?The heart of the question is:What is a good tasting tomato? As far as varieties offered widely today, I would recommend 'Big Beef'. It won the All-America Selections Award for its flavor. Generally, I am not a big fan of heirlooms. They are difficult to grow and yields are poor. However, many people grow them for the flavor of the fruits. 'Brandywine' is becoming more available these days and it is considered by many to be the best tasting tomato. Personally, I think 'Stupice' is the best tasting tomato. You will not find plants of it locally; let me know if you need a few seeds of it.This high acid/low acid comparisons are not very meaningful. Differences are not significant. Very few seed catalogs, including tomato seed catalogs will even mention it. I've never heard a gardener request for a high acid tomato before. Perhaps this year you should try a few plants of several varieties and see what appeals to you.Hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions. .

  - Although more prevalent in soils, your photo suggests that seedlings may have developed a fungal diseasecalled damping off (Pythium). Seedling stems become browned and "pinched". Stems may fall over and leaves drop or die.The strange leafspots may be edema.The most common cause  of edema is the presence of abundant, warm water and a cool, moist  atmosphere. Under these conditions roots absorb water at a rate faster than  is lost through transpiration. Excess water accumulates in the leaf, some  parenchyma cells enlarge and block the stomatal openings through which water  vapor is normally released from the plant; thereby contributing to further water  retention in the leaf. As cells divide, they take on a raised, corky, gall-likeappearance.

  - Hi,Sorry for the slow response. I am just now seeing your post but it should not have been from "Making it Public". That only turns on an option to allow the general public to make comments about your post.Here is what I was able to find out for you. According to LSU Extensionhttp://www.lsuagcenter.com/en/lawn_garden/home_gardening/vegetables/home_garden_crops/ContainerGrown...Determinate tomato varieties can be grown in containers better than indeterminate varieties because they are not as tall and are less prone to being blown over. Therefore, Goliath or Heinz would be better suited than Mortgage Lifter for container growing. I personally recommend you plant any container grown tomato in the biggest possible pot you can handle to keep the soil moisture as consistent as possible. If the tomato plant is allowed to get too dry during fruit production you can get blossom end rot which is a calcium deficiency due to the lack of water transporting it. Best of luck with your tomatoes. It looks like you have some tasty tomatoes in your future.Sincerely,Todd

  - It sounds like some of your seedling were affected by a fungal disease of the stem called "damping off". That seems less likely considering your use of a sterile seed starting medium. A quick summary of Damping off:  Damping  off is the fungal infection of seeds or seedlings that leads to death.  When infected with damping off,seedlings  develop but eventually fall over and die.   An examination of stems at the soil line reveals a discolored, pinched  in appearance.  Most plants are  susceptible to damping off because of the soft immature nature of seedling tissue  that is more susceptible to infection.The  best method to manage damping off is to avoid it in the first place.  For starting seeds indoors, use pasteurized  soil or planting mix and ensure that plants receive optimum light, water, and  heat for rapid germination and growth.  In  home situations, damping off frequently develops due to poor lighting and  overwatering.  These conditions stress  plants and make conditions optimal for the development of the soil-borne  organisms that cause damping off.  In  the garden, plant seeds at appropriate times (soil temperature for rapid  germination) for the crop and avoid overwatering for optimal germination and  growth.  A strong healthy plant is better  equipped to fight off infection.

Here is a link to the OSU Extension gardening calendar for May, with navigations to each month: http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/gardening-calendar/may.The gardening home page includes a link to download the excellent publication "Growing Your Own", which is valuable because it gives regional advice.

Most mint will spread rapidly, so growing in a container placed on a hard surface so the roots won't move through the drain holes into the garden is a safe method. Some gardeners have a separate area they can devote to mint, and as a perennial, you'll always have some once it is there.

  - Strawberries generally produce useable fruit between 18 and 45 days after blooming. The date varies with the variety and weather. Cooler weather will delay fruiting and ripening, warmer will speed it up.Your tomatoes should recover without nutrients. Generally when plants are stressed (as they are now, from sunscald), the last thing you want to do is add nutrients. You do want to fertilize tomatoes, avoiding too much nitrogen. Too much nitrogen causes leaves and stems to form at the expense of tomato fruit. If you are following the label directions of your fertilizer product you should be okay.To prepare tomatoes for full sun and outdoor conditions, it is best to gradually expose them to the outdoors (called "hardening off".) For 7-10 days, gradually expose them to full sun, wind, etc. Start off by setting them outside in the shade for a few hours. Then begin increasing the hours outdoors and the amount ofsunlight so that by the end of the week or ten days they have been outdoors around the clock for a couple days.

Some of the Oregon developed varieties like Oregon Spring, Legend, Willamette, Santiam, Siletz, etc will set fruit at lower night temperatures which is an advantage. For cherry tomatoes, Sungold is great (it is orange). Most other cherry tomatoes also do well. Some older varieties that are worth looking at for large slicing types include Big Beef, Cherokee purple and Brandywine. But almost anything you can buy locally should do well if we have a normal summer. Chip Bubl OSU Extension/Columbia County 503 397-3462.

  - Iron deficiencies are usually associated with soil pH's that are too high. I'm not familiar enough with the soils of Washington County, Texas to judge if that is reasonable or not, but I know parts of Texas do have have pH soils.Iron deficiency will be most acute in the newest growth with green leaf veins and yellow tissue between the veins. Chelated or liquid iron can be applied as a foliar spray and will reverse the situation quickly if the plants are growing reasonably well. It would be a good idea to treat with the iron several times at 3 to 5 day intervals to keep the plants green and growing. But, each treatment will only last a short time as the iron is used by the plant and the soil does not provide adequate iron to be taken up by the roots. Make sure you treat during the early morning or evening when the temperatures are lower.The ultimate solution is to reduce the soil pH which requires sulfur applications. Prilled or pelletized 90% sulfur is usually available in areas with high pH. A good rule of thumb is to apply 5 pounds per 1000 square feet per application. Mix lightly with the soil and water it in. This process will have to be repeated numerous times depending on where the soil pH is. A soil test before you begin would be helpful. All of this effort may not be worth it for the current tomato crop. But, working on the pH, adding pine-bark-based organic matter, adding sulfur, will pay dividends for future crops.

  - Tomatoes grow quite well in this area since there are over 2000 varieties out there you will probably need to limit yourself to some of the common types available in the local nurseries. Other varieties are available through mail order and can open up your choices. Keep the number of days to ripen in mind when selecting any variety since this will be a factor in how soon they are ready and if your growing season is long enough. The link included will provide you with some good information on growing and planting tomatoes.http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/717.html

  - Tomatoes are subject to a number of leaf diseases, and many growers experience the problems you have encountered. The severity of these diseases varies from year to year depending upon growing conditions. Following are some cultural practices that will reduce, if not eliminate, the effects of these diseases:1. Plant disease resistant varieties. Look for letters such as VNFT on seed packets. 2. Allow plenty of space between plants. Good air circulation reduces moist conditions that promote the growth of fungal diseases.3. Avoid overhead watering.4. Remove (do not compost) diseased vines from the garden after the growing season.5. Mulch the plants to keep soil borne disease spores from splashing onto the leaves.6. Apply fungicides labeled to control tomato leaf diseases before evidence of disease is present.If the plants continue to fail, try growing some in containers well away from the garden plot. Do not fill the containers with garden soil.Go here to learn more about tomato leaf diseases:Controlling Tomato leaf Spot Diseaseshttp://byf.unl.edu/TomatoLeafDiseases

## 16529_Illinois

  - Thank you for your letter to eXtension. I see no benefit to using aspirin as a pest control. The link you provide discusses the use of salicylic acid (a chemical similar to the active ingredient in aspirin) against one very particular bacterial disease. Several things of importance to note: Salicylic acid is not aspirin. The active ingredient is acetyl-salicylic acid, which is similar, but not identical to, the product from willow trees. Also, there are many additives and buffers in aspirin that may negate the effect as a chemical protectant. The disease, potato purple top phytoplasma, is not a common problem in the midwest. In fact, it's so rare, it's not listed in either of my tomato disease textbooks. So, there's no reason to control for this disease. According to the article, at best, only half of the plants were protected by this treatment. Even if this was a common disease in the midwest, 50% plant loss is terrible control. Finally...technically...using aspirin as a pest control chemical is illegal. What does every aspirin commercial say? "Use only as directed." Indeed, it is a violation of federal pesticide laws to use any chemical contrary to its label directions. While this is mostly a technical point (the pesticide police will not kick your door down because you're using aspirin on your tomatoes), it is still a consideration, especially if someone allergic to aspirin gets sick after eating one of your tomatoes. In short: don't waste your time or money dosing your plants with aspirin, or any other non-labeled product. There is no benefit.

  - Looks like flea beetles are attacking the plant. The damage can be important on very young transplants such as small seedlings. Youll help the plants gain an advantage by growing them on in containers until they grow a bit larger before you plant them in the garden.     Flea beetles are metallic greenish brown to black in color and from 0.06 to 0.12 inch long. Adults survive the winter in trash around the garden margins. The adults become active in late March through May. So, it can help avoid at least some of the problem by waiting to plant in the garden until late May or even into June. By then, the weather is also usually consistently warm which encourages the tomatoes to grow rapidly.    If you want to try pesticides, azadirachtin (neem) and pyrethrins are organic options listed for home garden use. Dilute (if needed) and apply the product according to label directions.

  - Thank you for sending your pictures to eXtension. I'll have to admit that even with all my years of working with tomatoes, I've never seen anything quite like this. The spots are not the typical spots I'd see for the more common leaf spot diseases of tomatoes (early blight or septoria leaf spot), nor do they look like bacterial spot. Blowing up the picture to maximum, I see a lot of debris or objects that I'm not sure what they are. Iwould suggest that you bring some fresh samples to the Purdue Extension Office in your county. Jon Cain is the Agriculture Educator in Hendricks County, and the address is: 1900 E. Main St., Danville, IN. I would suggest that Jon send these samples to the Purdue Diagnostic Lab for analysis; this will cost you $11. If you choose not to go this route, than keep monitoring the plants over the next couple of weeks. If the spots continue to spread or enlarge, spray them with chlorothalonil (sold as Daconil) according to label directions. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

  - This appears to be Tomato Leaf-mold, Fulvia fulva (formerly Cladosporium fulvum), a fungus. Read the descriptions about what the underside of the leaf spots look like, which will help with your diagnosis. (A long-distance diagnosis from me isn't 100% positive. I've attached link to descriptions below.)What makes me consider that this is the problem is how it looks, and the fact that they were in a greenhouse. This is more commonly a greenhouse plant issue. Also, some cultivars are more susceptible than others, so that explains why not all of your plants have it yet. Are these on the older leaves? That is also a clue.So, what to do? Certainly remove leaves with visible fungus, increase air circulation, don't get the leaves wet when watering. Perhaps isolate these plants from the others, and consider removing them totally if the leaf problem continues. Fungal infections can transfer to other plants.Here is the Pacific-Northwest Handbook page about Leaf-Mold giving description including the leaf under-side, and controls. http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/node/6140/print This page from Cornell, though focused on New York growing conditions, explains the disease well, and offers many photos, http://www.longislandhort.cornell.edu/vegpath/photos/leafmold_tomato.html

## 16795_Oregon

  - This is most likely a nutrient deficiency of either nitrogen and/or iron. These deficiency symptoms tend to show up most vividly in the newest growth. Unfortunately, the "why" of a nutrient deficiency is not easy to answer since it involves what is in the soil re the N or Fe and how effectively the plants roots can retrieve the nutrients and distribute them to the above-ground portions of the plants. Your comment that you haven't watered much yet may be part of the answer. Even though the plant isn't showing any wilting, a marginal moisture stress could impact the capturing and transport of the iron or nitrogen by the roots. So I would water some (not excessively) and drench the soil once or twice with a liquid fertilizer that contained both nitrogen and iron. You might see results fairly quickly (a week or two). The plants do look healthy overall. You might see some yellowing of the lower older leaves as a they try to export some of their stored nitrogen to the upper portion of the plant. This is normal on plants that don't show any deficiency symptoms. There may even be some variety issues coming into play. Some tomato types do better than others in specific circumstances (i.e. greenhouse conditions, cooler temps, marginal moisture stress) than others. So I don't think there is a root disease issue. And it is possible it might clear up with just some irrigation alone. There is an outside chance of Roundup herbicide injury (perhaps mist from a spray when the greenhouse was opened up). But that probably isn't too likely. . Anyway, these are the most likely possibilities in my experience. If you have more information, let me know. Chip  OSU Extension Agent

  - I am sorry that cutworms ate your tomato plants. In early spring, young cutworms climbs up the stem and eat the tender foliage at night. The older cutworms also take the upper stem off. During the day they crawl back down to the ground and burrow into the ground near the stems of the plants. Check around the base of the plants to see if there are any insect burrows. There are a number of things that work fairly well to prevent cutworm damage to plants.

  - That looks like a severe case of zippering and catfacing. This phenomenon occurs when the anther of the tomato sticks to the developing fruit and produces a scar as the fruit develops. Catfacing occurs when there are deformities on the developing flower. Both these phenomenons are more prone to occur when there are cold conditions during flower and fruit development. Large fruited tomato varieties such as brandywine are prone to catfacing.If possible, I would appreciate if you would be able to take some high resolution photos of the damaged fruit (on the plant and when picked) and send the to me for use in training programs. I would appreciate that greatly. (kevo@tamu.edu)

  - A layer of mulch (straw, plastic, grass ) will help conserve soil moisture during the hot, dry days of July and August. In addition to moisture, tomatoes need warm soil. Black plastic mulch will work wonders if you live in a land of cool summers.  In a raised bed, your soil will warm up quicker so you can plant earlier in spring. Of course it also will cool down more quickly in fall. But a raised bed also provides a ready structure to support a clear lid for a season-extending cold frame. Or add hoops to support translucent fabric that can add weeks to the growing season in spring and fall and shade greens from bolting in the hot summer sun, or netting to protect plants from insects and birds. A raised bed with 8- to 10-inch-high walls and a low fence of chicken wire is also an excellent defense against rabbits.

  - What you described is not necessarily bad. The fact that you have a bad smell suggest that there are microbes growing. This could be good microbe and/or bad microbes. Your photos does not tell much either. But I am guessing that the root are rotting. This could be due to excessive wetness in the root zone. I would suggest that you sacrifice 1-2 plants to look at their root system. My guess is that you would find few roots and/or the roots look unhealthy (brown or black). There is also the possibility that one or more pathogens may be involved in the root rot. IF that is the case, then there is no much that can be done for recovery.Here is the following plan of action that I would suggest:1. Check roots2. If root appear rotting but see some new (white) roots forming, then be careful with irrigation (reduce water), pinch off top (reduce green plant parts) and utilize product to encourage root growth (NOT green growth. ie. avoid hi Nitrogen fertilizers).3. If not see new root and root appear to be severely damage, remove and destroy plants. Start preparing for fall garden. i.e. Prepare garden soils (solarize soil, etc...)

  - From the size of the holes as well as your description of the small black bugs, my guess is that the pests are flea beetles. The beetles have that name because, when disturbed, they jump like fleas.    With so many holes in the laves, I can understand your concern. Even so, its very unlikely those holes add up to more than 10 percent of the foliage. In other words, your tomatoes will be fine as long as you ensure the soil is evenly moist.

  - If the leaves are truly dry  as in papery and crunchy  then its likely the plant ran out of water at some point. If the water immediately runs out the drains holes, then you will need to submerge the rootball in water. Keep it there for a maximum of 20 minutes; if longer, you roots will be damaged. But if the leaf tissues are fresh, slightly thickened, and brittle such that the leaves break when you try to unroll them, its possible it inadvertently received a dose of herbicide (weed killer). Any chance of that, however unlikely you think that might be? If the above doesnt provide an answer, please reply with additional details of what has occurred since you brought the plant home. Please include the details of the potting mix (commercial or homemade) and what you might have added to it.   Also include another image which shows the tip of one of the main stems.

  - Thank you including images with your question as it helps me sort between the two most common reasons for distorted new growth on tomatoes: Virus or herbicide. In home gardens, my experience is that inadvertent herbicide damage is much more common than is virus. The leaves on your tomatoes have classic symptoms of a phenoxy herbicide, most likely a formulation that contains 2,4-D or dicamba. Unintended damage to desirable plants may occur via over-spray; volatilization when temperatures rise; drift (a breeze or the wind); spray turbulence; or even if a sprayer used to apply an insecticide or fungicide was previously used for herbicides. Virus infected plants continue to show deformed growth throughout their lives, often becoming worse with time, whereas plants may grow out of herbicide damage.

In reading the description of your problem, it appeared that it could well be common mosaic of tomato http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-double-streak .The tomato may well have had the problem when purchased as it seemed to quickly deteriorate. However, this disease may be carried from potatoes or tomatoes that are growing or in the vacinity from a previous season. The obvious solution is to pull any that are showing these symptoms immediately. It is also good practice not to let volunteers come up in your garden or compost as they may well be harboring the disease. You would probably be safe to replant, but choose a different location in your garden if you do.The plant clinic is a good place in Myrtle Point is a good place to take your specimens for a 'live' look into your problem as well.

  - When it comes to tomatoes dropping flowers there are many reasons: possible moisture issue, fluctuations, over watering, under watering, excessive heat, wind or fertilizing practices and nutrients that are available in the soil. These are all questions that must have answers to narrow the possible causes down.Pruning off suckers at the base is a mater of preference and does not guarantee heavy production up top. Many gardeners only do tip pruning late in the season to promote fruit set. You can leave them on or prune them off for a clean appearance.As for fertilizers that becomes varies depending on a soil analysis and available nutrients. If you add finished compost to the soil or compost tea, the soil will feed the plant in small amounts and the plant will grow appropriately to what the conditions provide. If you you a standard organic or chemical tomato feed you may add more of an nutrient that is already available in adequate quantities in the soil. If this nutrient is nitrogen you could end up with a very large plant with no fruit.A complete soil test every two years can give you a good base to understand what you plants will need in the growing to come.

  - Thank you for using Ask an Expert. Let's separate your question into two subjects: raspberries and tomatoes. Your raspberries are likely suffering from a common affliction: phytophora root rot.This is a soil-borne disease which is exacerbated by poor drainage. Unfortunately there is no cure for it. For specifics of this disease, you can consult pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/raspberry. Search for rubus--root rot. Please do not try to salvage your older plants or move them. If you want to grow raspberries, try some of the newer varieties which may have more resistance to the disease. Plant on a raised bed well away from your current site. Go easy on soil additives such as compost and manures which tend to keep moisture around the plants. Raspberries do not have a long lifespan in the best of conditions, so replacing your older vines in a new location and monitoring the drainage and water use carefully is your best option. As for the tomatoes, you did not give us enough information . Are the leaves yellowing and the plants dying as a result? Some leaf yellowing is normal (the very bottom row of leaves in some varieties always yellows), but if the plant is dying, you may be facing a blight situation. Do you relocate your tomato patch each year? Planting in the same location each yearhelpsdiseases build up in the soil. Once the disease takes hold, it can infect any member of the solanaceous family (tomato, potato, pepper, eggplant) that you plant there. OSU Extension recommends a 3 year crop rotation plan to help avoid soil issues.( Do not plant any member of a family in the same place that any member of that family grew the previous 3 years.) For a firm diagnosis, you can take a sample of the tomato problem (or a photograph) to the Jackson County OSU Extension Office Master Gardener Plant Clinic , 569 Hanley Road, Central Point. Telephone 541-776-7371 for current hours. We hope you have better luck in the future!

  - Thank you for your question to Ask an Expert.For the raspberries, verticillium wilt damage does travel up the stem, so that could be the culprit. Do you see bluish streaks on the stems and a tuft of green leaves at the tip? If not, then you could check the symptoms that you see with other major problems with raspberries here:http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/blackberries.htmlFor the tomatoes and potatoes, the verticillum causes them to wilt by day and revive at night, so that too seems like the cause: http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-wilts-fusarium-wilt-verticillium...For all of the crops, I would remove them and grow other types of plants that are not susceptible to this disease andAvoid planting other susceptible crops, which may increase rather than lower the soil's Verticillium  content. Susceptible crops include potato, tomato, strawberry,  caneberry, stone fruit, eggplant, pepper, and, among nursery trees,  maple, as well as many common weeds in the nightshade family.If you want to plant these crops in this same location, try using containers, which you could still do this year and should do for 5+ years. In terms of solarization, clear plastic is recommended for that practice and it has not been shown to be effective in the PNW, but it is shaping up to be a warm summer, so you could try, but you will not know whether it has worked until you plant susceptible crops again or potentially perform testing for the disease in the soil.Please let me know if you have any further questions.Weston

  - The formation of atomato following pollination is caused bycertain plant hormones. The commercial product blossom-set contains gibberillic acid, one of the hormones produced naturally after pollination. Thus the tomato flower is stimulated to start enlarging the ovary and forming a fruit even though pollination has not occurred.Tomato plants will not set fruit when air temperatures are too cool.

  - Your tomatoes have one, possibly two, fungal diseases. Early blight disease is infecting the leaves and will eventually kill the plant if you do not take steps. Pick off all infected leaves and gather any dead leaves that have fallen, in other words, all infected material. Dispose of it off-site. This disease starts at the bottom of the plant and works its way up, so keep a close eye on the plants and continue to remove infect parts. You can also spray with a fungicide, but do it in the evening when bees are less active. Fungicides have been shown to be toxic enough to weaken pollinators. See our website's tomato fact sheet for information on fungicides to use and other preventive measures for the future: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoe...Wet leaves contributes to this disease. Be sure to water your plants without wetting the foliage. Direct the hose only at the base and roots of the plants. Because the spores of this disease overwinter in the soil, remove all tomato debris at the end of the season and place 3-4 layers of newspaper under your mulch next year to prevent new spores from splashing on the lower leaves and starting infection all over again.

  - Growing tomatoes at the Oregon coast can be a challenge because of the cool temperatures during the growing season. Cover early planted tomatoes with a mini-hoop or use another season-extending technique like a greenhouse to keep the plants warmer. You'll also want to optimize for the short growing season. Choose a cool-season adapted variety with a shorter time to maturity. Look for varieties that are under 70 to 80 days to maturity like Early Girl, Oregon Spring, Santiam, Oregon Pride, Oregon Star, Siletz, or Legend. The type of fertilizer you use should also be considered: tomatoes will respond to high nitrogen fertilizer by producing lush foliage but very few flowers. Use a fertilizer that has some nitrogen but a lower ratio of nitrogen to phosphorus to potassium (N-P-K): look for a fertilizer labeled specifically for tomatoes or in the range of 8-32-16 or 6-24-24. Oregon State University Extension has a publication called Growing Your Own with general information on vegetable gardening; page 18 has some specific advice for gardening at the coast. You can also check with the Master Gardeners in the Lincoln County Extension Office in Newport. They will have first-hand experience gardening at the coast. Here is their contact information. It is best to call ahead to make sure they are in the office: http://extension.oregonstate.edu/lincoln/find-usGood luck and happy gardening!

  - To give you the best answer for controlling the larvae that is damaging your asparagus it would be helpful if you could provide a live sample of the larvae. If you select to bring in a living larvae, or the beetle, place them in a container with some of the plant material on which they are feeding. Here is the link to the website for the asparagus beetle. There are photos of the various phases in its life cycle, including the larvae stage. http://insect.pnwhandbooks.org/vegetable/vegetable-pests/hosts-and-pests/asparagus-asparagus-beetle. In this paper there are measures that can be used to control the beetle, to include organic measures. As for your question on the Beef Steak tomatoes, my all-time favorite cultivar of tomato, I have grown them (and eaten them) all over the USA, Unfortunately, the Beef Steak does not do well in our area. The Beefsteak takes 85 days to mature and produce fruit. It also wants a soil temperature of 60 degrees (F) or higher. The length of our growing season and the soil temperature requirement both negatively impact the success of the Beefsteak in our area. The curling of the leave may be caused by our current night temperature that dip below 55 degrees (F). However, there are many causes for tomato leaf curl. Here is a link to an excellent paper on Tomato Leaf Curl. http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/PNW616/PNW616.pdf. My suggestion is to find and plant one of the many tomato cultivars that do well in the Willamette Valley.

## 18852_Ohio

  - From your description, it sounds like Blossom End Rot. Blossom End Rot is a common problem with tomatoes. It is not caused by a disease. It is caused by an inadequate supply of calcium. I don't know what formulation of Miracle Gro you are using, but you should not use a fertilizer that is high in Nitrogen. One drawback of growing plants in a pot or planter is that they do require frequent watering and the frequent watering flushes the fertilizer from the planter. Following are a few links to fact sheets with additional information about Blossom End Rot and how to control it:http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/hot_topics/2007/07blossomendrot.html http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_BlossRt.htm

  - Do you mean safe for the plant or safe because of the weather? If you are going to remove the walls-o-water it should be done before the plant get too big or heavy with fruit that you do not damage the plant when taking off the walls-o-water. If you are asking because of weather, it can freeze any time here on the high desert. Many people leave their walls-o-water on all season. At any rate be ready to cover the part of the plant that is not inside the season extender if there is a chance of a freeze.

## 19360_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/19360_Oregon
  - It appears that your tomatoes have early blight which is generally an uncommon disease in western Oregon. If it is early blight, the small, dark spots will become elongated lesions with concentric markings such as you can see in Fig. 3 at http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/450/450-708/450-708_pdf.pdf     Spotting may be on older leaves early in the season, but the greatest injury usually is as fruit begins to mature because defoliation (leaf loss) may be severe, exposing the fruit to sun scald. The disease also affects the fruit directly.     Unfortunately, environmental conditions are currently very favorable for disease on tomatoes. And in your case, overhead watering is a contributing factor.     Management must include cultural methods:  - Maintain plant vigor and proper fertilization.  - To help keep leaves dry, irrigate at ground level.   - If you must continue with overhead watering, do so early in the day so that the leaves dry before nightfall. (With our current cool humid weather, this wont be possible.) - Because your plants are already infected, you may want to consider rigging temporary overhead protection from rainfall. - Remove and destroy plant debris at season-end.   - Eradicate volunteer tomato plants.- In future seasons, use a 3-4 year rotation with nonhost crops.     To reinforce the above actions, protect healthy growth with Bonide Fung-onil as directed on the label.

## 19487_Minnesota
* askextension_tomato/19487_Minnesota
  - Are all the tomatoes the same variety? If not, this could account for the difference. Some varieties mature faster and bear fruit sooner than others. If the plants are all the same variety and the seeds were planted at the same time and the transplants were set into the garden or container at the same time, variables such as soil conditions (fertility and moisture), light and stress of one kind or another could explain why the tardy plant hasn't flowered. If the plant appears to be healthy, it's possible that nothing is wrong and that in time it will bear flowers and fruit normally.

  - What you describe is usually caused by weed killers, either an overspray or could be Weed and Feed granules put on the lawn got into the soil.

  - It looks like a combination of a fungal pathogen and an insect called western flower thrips. Hard to tell from the picture, but the black dots might be from the thrips feeding (excrement). The thrips' feeding cause the "bleached" looking areas on the foliage.The disease is more of an issue, and from the picture, looks like it might be early blight. Here is some more info: http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/450/450-708/450-708_pdf.pdf. But I would recommend that you submit a sample to the Utah Plant Pest Diagnostic Lab at http://utahpests.usu.edu/uppdl/htm/forms ($7). There is a possibility that it is "late blight" which is a much more serious disease. If the necrotic (dead) areas appear shiny/greasy, that could be late blight (http://usablight.org/node/29)

## 19742_Delaware
* askextension_tomato/19742_Delaware
  - This type question is impossible to 100% diagnose without a physical examination by a horticultural specialist -- but based on your description and my examination of the picture, I think you have damage due to a herbicide coming in contact with the tomato plants. I am attaching an excellent link from the Univ of Tennessee with several photos of herbicide-damaged tomatoes - their photos seem to resemble your photo:https://utextension.tennessee.edu/publications/Documents/W295-B.pdfIf this isn't the problem (which may or may not be fatal - depending on the level of damage) then the only likely alternative is a virus - or several viruses. These are highly contagious and can spread throughout your garden, so if you think this might be it, then I would definitely destroy all plants.Sorry for the bad news - but there's always next season; unfortunately, since they veggie growing season is short for most plants, once they become unhealthy (for whatever reason) it is often impossible to bring them back to health in time, and save that season's crop.

## 19762_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/19762_Michigan
  - Here are several possibilities, going from the common to the uncommon, as to why your tomato plants might be wilting and dying: 1. There is a walnut tree within 50 to 70 feet of the garden. Walnut roots contain juglone and when tomato roots and walnut roots make contact, the tomato dies. Or for some reason, a quantity of walnut wood chips were used in the garden.2. These are antique or heritage varieties that are not resistant to Verticillium or Fusarium. Those are vascular diseases that cause the sap in the plant to get sticky and it does not go anywhere. Plants wilt and die. Modern varieties are resistant and tell you on the tag. Following the tomato name are the letters VFN. That stands for resistant to Verticillium, Fusarium, and nematodes.3. Look at the base of the plant where it comes out of the ground. If the that area is dark brown or black, it could be collar rot. Several fungi cause this. It might only be a small lesion and not all the way around the stem. Cut a stem off and look at the inside. Rhizoctonia will cause the center of the stem to collapse and darkenwhile the outside looks fine.4. Lawn clippings were used on the garden thathad a broadleaf weed killer with 2,4D in it applied. By their very definition, tomatoes are broadleaf weeds. It usually happens when grass clippings are used within six weeks of a broadleaf weed application.5. Bacterial canker is not common but is worth mentioning. Leaflets wilt first and die and turn brown from the leaf edges going in on the leaf.6. You need to carefully remove a plant and look at the root system. If it is abnormally small, there is a tiny chance of grub activity. You should be able to find grubs.

## 19783_Maryland

  - Your photo is so out of focus that we can't tell what the problem may be. We'd invite you to send us another photo.Tomatoes are very sensitive to herbicide damage, especially 2-4D weed killer. Herbicides can be wafted over to a plant on a slight breeze. Or, oftentime the nozzle of a sprayer has a very fine spray that goes beyond the spray that you see with the naked eye and you can inadvertantly end up spraying weedkiller on your desirable plants. If the contact is minor, the plants will recover. If the plants absorbed too much herbicide, they will die.

  - There are a few thoughts about squirrels liking tomatoes - one may be that they need water, so including a bird bath in your garden may help with that, also including a squirrel feeder that moves them away from your garden is an option. There is a specific hot pepper was animal repellent that may help rather than red pepper.  You may put noise makers, shiny pinwheels or things moved by wind, which they may eventually move past.Also, squirrels are awake by day, sleeping by night, so if the damage is happening at night (which you haven't mentioned) it can be other critters eating your tomatoes.

* askextension_tomato/19844_Connecticut
  - The stunting you refer to in your peppers, could be caused by several issues. First of all, as you mentioned the, planting peppers in the same location as tomatoes were last year could be part of the problem. Since peppers and tomatoes are in the same family, they should be rotated to a different location within the garden each year. Also, soil fertility plays a major role in the production garden plants. I would highly suggest that you contact your local Cooperative office to see about having your soil tested.

## 19927_Texas

  - I imagine it is grasshoppers causing the problem but rabbits and birds can cause similar problems too. Our research garden is located in a large pasture and the grasshoppers are relentless and we are having the same problems. We are not spraying pesticide either. We are considering adding insect screening or row cover cloth over PVC hoops to keep the grasshoppers out. However it is too late for this current crop. We might replant or cut back the plants for a fall crop.

## 19973_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/19973_Michigan
  - Tomatoes are susceptible to several leaf diseases and it is hard to say which one it might be. However, this is the time of year early blight typically shows up. Early blight overwinters in the soil and is splashed onto the plant by rain and then moves around in the plant by additional rain events. The general symptoms are a yellowing of the older leaves first and gradually moving up the plant until only a tuft of new leaves are left at the tips. The first steps in preventing it (and many other diseases) are to create a barrier between the plant and the soil so soil cannot splash onto the plant during heavy rains. This is done with organic or plastic mulch. The next step is to get the plant off the ground by using cages or stakes. The final stage is spraying them for control. Sprays need to be applied ahead of any rain event since they work by protecting the plant. They do not cure the disease. A general garden fungicide with chlorothalonil as the active ingredient will work. Organic controls are Serenade, Trilogy and various copper products. A good general disease control is a copper plus the chlorothalonil. They can be applied together and should be applied every 7 to 10 days.

  - Hi Lisa, I cannot be sure, but this could be late blight on your tomato (Phytopthora infestans). The lesions on the stems and the greasy lesions that initially appearon the leaves suggests this to me. I don't see any distinct rings around the lesions, which occurs with other, more common tomato diseases.  I encourage you to go to the web site http://usablight.org/and watch a video on how to distinguish late blight from other tomato diseases. There is a test where you can trim off an infected branch, and put it in a Ziploc bag with moist paper towels overnight to trigger the white sporulation of the blight.  I encourage you to send these photos and e-mail message to Kasia Kinzer, our state pathologist for crops at kasia.kinzer@ndsu.edu. Late blight is very destructive. Pick off infected leaves and spray chlorothalonil (Daconil, Bravo) or mancozeb (Maneb, Dithane) to protect against further infection. Keep the foliage dry when watering. Prompt action is needed since this fungus can kill plants in a matter of days.  Images of late blight can be found at Google Images. Kasia would be a good person to contact. Let me know if you have any more information. - Tom

  - Any infected plant tissue cannot be saved but new growth has a chance. Blights are soil born and every effort must be made to stop soil from splashing onto the leaves. Newspaper isn't necessary but mulch is. Plants should be staked and tied with leaves anywhere near the ground removed. Water only from the bottom and then do it in the morning giving plants a chance to be dry during overnight hours. I haven't heard about newspaper ink containing GMO's but it does make sense. I suppose one could use cardboard instead.

## 20210_Colorado

  - It looks like your tomato plant has early blight---here is an excerpt from our fact sheet on common tomato problems:   "Early blight (Alternaria leaf spot) is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. Symptoms become prevalent during the hotter months. This disease produces brown to black, target-like spots on older leaves. If severe, the fungus also attacks stems and fruit. Affected leaves may turn yellow, then drop, leaving the fruit exposed to sunburn. Sanitation is the best control. Remove all diseased plant tissue on the ground, as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris. Do not plant tomatoes in the same place next year. Space plants farther apart to improve air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation. If the infestation is heavy, sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection."      Here is a link to the entire fact sheet: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/garden/02949.html as well as a link to another fact sheet on early blight: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/718.html      I am not sure about the black flies. There are insects called a flea beetles, they are tiny beetles that jump like fleas when disturbed. Several species feed on potatoes, eggplant, corn, spinach, sweet potatoes, tomatoes, peppers, cucumbers, squash, and other vegetables. The easiest way to identify them is by their tiny size and the fact that they jump like a flea. They also typically make "shot hole  like damage to leaves. If your plants look riddled with tiny holes as well it might be flea beetles. Here is a fact sheet with more information: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/pubs/insect/05592.html      You are more than welcome to bring a sample of your plant to the Denver Extension office at 888 E.

## 20216_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/20216_Oregon
  - This isn't an easy question, in part, due the the widely variable genetic makeup of tomato varieties, particularly in regards to their responses to cool and/or very hot conditions. Assuming both are getting the same amount of sun, my best guess would be that the problem plant may be getting either over or under watered for its size. Either situation could cause the same outward "cupping" symptoms in the leaves. Earlier in the year, I might have questioned the cool tolerance of one variety over the other. Some of the large tomatoes like Beefmaster and others don't like cool night temps and refuse to set fruit or set deformed fruit. But we are now past cool night temperatures so that isn't an issue with the plant foliage now though it may account for the "double" tomato that you reported which would have been pollinated several weeks ago. For growing tomatoes in pots, you should buy a cheap moisture meter with a 12-inch probe to periodically check the moisture conditions in your pots. Hope this helps.

  - Your message seems to include three somewhat related problems. First, the yellowing branches could very well be nitrogen deficiency. The heavy June rains have leached nitrogen out of the soil. I'd suggest a boost of a high-N fertilizer. If you can't find such a thing, then try one of the various "vegetable" or "tomato foods":http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/717.html#fertilizationThe brown spots are probably early signs of some fungal blight, such as Septoria leaf spot or early blight. Proper culture can reduce such blights, but some years are worse than others. This may be a bad year, again because of the June rains.http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato/http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/early-blight-of-tomatoes-and-potatoes/Failure to set fruit can be due to many factors,includingtemperature,moisture levelandpollinators.

  - Hi, When I read your question I thought it might be a disease as early blight and a few other diseases have been noticed but your leaves look okay except for the yellow color so I am guessing nitrogen deficiency. Container plants need to be fertilized often because of the constant watering. I fertilize mine every few days with a dilute fertilizer. So I would use either an organic or synthetic liquid fertilizer and mix it as directed into your watering can and apply it at the frequency listed on the label.

## 20287_Michigan

  - I suspect that it is a water problem.   Many plants and trees  (especially in clay based soils) are struggling with excessive moisture.  The spaces between the particles of soil fill with water instead of air and the plant suffocates. Since there are no other symptoms described this is most likely the problem.  Tomatoes need 1" of wter per week. It is possible that some root rot has begun also. One way to check for root rot is to keep an ye on the stem of the plant near where it enters the ground to see if it gets black and/or mushy looking. If  this is present there is not hope for saving the plants.  If any other symptoms develop please send pictures to help in the diagnosis.  Thank you.

  - Hello Gardener,I'm in Alabama, but this sounds familiar to many gardeners in any location.While we all love a fresh tomato, they are one of the most persnickety of all veggies to grow. They need consistent soil moisture (not too wet, and never dry) - cool soil (mulch is a must) - air temp's between 60F-90F (each variety varies in preference though) - steady nutrition - soil calcium - soil pH between 6.0-7.0 - and patience.When tomatoes fail to set fruit, I normally suspect stress either from moisture (too much or not enough), temperature (nights too cool/too hot,or days too hot), or excess nitrogen. Noticing your location, I'll suspect the cool nights are causing the flowers to drop. They do this anytime an environmental stress causes the pollen to fail. Dead pollen then makes the flower drop off the plant.Once the temperatures are a little warmer, you plants should set fruit as expected.I hope this information was helpful. Happy gardening.

  - Tobacco Mosaic Virus of Tomato    Unlike fungicidal chemicals used to control fungal diseases, to date there are no efficient chemical treatments that protect plant parts from virus infection.    The virus enters plants through wounds sustained in transplanting or pruning. It spreads rapidly once it is in the host. Tobacco products are the most common source of inoculum; smokers can infect plants by handling them. The virus is not spread by aphids.   Additionally, there are no known chemical treatments used under field conditions that eliminate viral infections from plant tissues once they do occur. Practically speaking, plants infected by viruses remain so. Thus, control of tobacco mosaic virus is primarily focused on reducing and eliminating sources of the virus and limiting the spread by insects. Tobacco mosaic virus is the most persistent plant virus known. It has been known to survive up to 50 years in infected seeds, plant debris, and even clothing. Also, it is extremely tolerant of very high temperatures. Therefore, sanitation is the single most important practice in controlling tobacco mosaic virus.    Organic Pest Management Strategies   1. Remove and destroy infected plants. Pull plants with mosaic symptoms immediately. Remove the debris from the garden area and bury them if possible.   2. Keep your garden weed-free. Use an appropriate organic herbicide on weeds or remove weeds by hand.   3. Always wash your hands thoroughly and disinfect tools. Before handling plants, wash with soap and water, especially if you're a smoker.   4. Plant resistant varieties of tomato. Suggested varieties include: Big Pick, Celebrity, President, and Park's Extra Early Hybrid. Other resistant varieties will be labeled TMV resistant.

  - This may be a combination of early blight and septoria leaf spot. The life cycles are similar.  Unfortunately, plants can still get early blight even with all the good measures you have taken.  Please read over the info on early blight in our "IPM Series: Tomatoes" to be sure you do each possible task, such as removing all infected debris at the end of the season: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoe...Fungicides cannot cure a fungal disease, but are preventative. Spray when you plant, or as soon as you see the first trace of the disease remove the infected part and spray. Keep in mind that fungicides have been discovered to be toxic to bees, so do not spray the flowers. ECN

  - You are most likely referring to blossom end rot. The  bottom (blossom) end of the fruit bottoms becomes brown and rotted.  Promptly remove any fruits that have blossom-end rot or are badly  malformed. This nutritional disorder is caused by a lack of calcium in  developing fruits and is brought on by dry conditions and inconsistent  watering. Water your plants deeply and regularly and keep them mulched.  Tomato plants may need 1-2 gallons of water each at least twice a week  during droughty periods. Plants tend to grow out of the problem.

  - Tomato leaves will curl due to several factors.  For example, some varieties are more prone to leaf curl in hot weather than others.  The following publication may offer some suggestions:http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoe...Tomato plants are also very sensitive to herbicidal burn. 2,4-D and glyphosate (Roundup) will volatilize in hot weather and will drift with the slightest breeze for a great distance. Typically, the top leaves of tomatoes will become distorted and twisted when hit by one of these chemicals. The plant usually grows out of this damage.Tomatoes and some other plants are two or three weeks behind their normal schedule this year. This was due to the late spring and the delay in the soil temperature warming up.LS

  - Tom:  The condition you describe has several things that can cause the buds to not mature and to drop from the vine. Some of the causes are lack of water, insufficient nitrogen, several plant diseases, lack of pollination, stress on the plant, mechanical damage, and insect damage. This link will give additional information on causes.      http://www.njfarmfresh.rutgers.edu/documents/BlossomDropinTomatoes.pdf      I suggest that you consider how and when you water your tomatoes. Tomatoes should be deep watered to establish a healthy root system. You should also ensure that the plant has adequate nitrogen. You should prune the dead buds from the plant and put them in the trash (not in your compose). If you are still getting flowers on your plants the deep watering and fertilizer may help. If the plant is diseased you should remove the plant, bag it, and place it in the trash to be hauled away. I highly recommend that you annually rotate where you plant your tomatoes.

## 20802_Maryland

  - There are lots of environmental and cultural factors that could result in flowers but no fruit. Excessive heat kills the pollen of tomato flowers. Excessive rain can hamper the pollination process. Excessive nitrogen fertilizer can result in excessive foliage and not much fruit. Also, the extended cool spring weather we experienced set everything back at least two weeks this year, so it may be that patience is the best advice for now. Incidentally, you're in good company. This is a common complaint this year.LS

Regarding pinching back, however, I can give you a more specific answer and that would be to pinch out the 'laterals' which are the tiny new branches growing in between each tomato leaf and the stem. You must do this often to prevent too much green growth because if the energy of the plant goes into growing those sideshoots, you'll end up with many fewer flowers, and even fewer tomatoes. They'll also come on later and take longer to ripen. If you are growing a long-season (needing more heat) variety, this means that the result will be especially disapointing--as it's a challenge to grow tomatoes in our cooler coastal climate anyhow!

  - Unfortunately, it is too late to control tomato diseases for 2014.  However, good cultural practices may help prevent this problem from reoccurring in 2015.    This fall, carefully remove as much of the plant debris as possible from the garden and destroy it.  Next spring, plant tomatoes in a different location in the garden.  Rotate crops so that tomatoes and other solanaceous crops (potatoes, peppers, and eggplants) are not grown in the same area for at least 3 years.  There is no home garden treatment that effectively destroys the disease pathogens in the soil.    When planting tomatoes, space plants approximately 3 feet apart.  Wide plant spacing increases air movement and promotes rapid drying of plant foliage.    Grow tomato plants in wire cages or train them to a stake.  The foliage of tomatoes grown in wire cages and those trained to stakes dries more quickly than those sprawling on the ground.      Avoid wetting tomato foliage when watering.  Apply water directly to the ground around plants with a soaker hose, slow running hose, or watering can.  If a sprinkler must be used, water in the morning so the foliage dries quickly.  While cultural practices can help control diseases of tomatoes, fungicides may also be needed.  Apply fungicides, such as chlorothalonil, at regular intervals beginning 3 to 4 weeks after planting.  Thorough coverage is essential.  Be sure to spray both the upper and lower leaf surfaces as well as the centers of the plants.  Spray to the point of runoff.

  - The small, round, tomato-like bjects are the fruit of the potato plant.  	Tomatoes and potatoes belong to the Solanaceae or Nightshade family.  Plants within a family share certain morphological characteristics. The  flowers on tomatoes and potatoes are similar in appearance. Potato fruit  are similar in shape (though much smaller in size) to those on  tomatoes. 	Most flowers on potato plants dry up and drop from the plant and dont  develop into fruit. The fruit that do develop are relatively small and  inconspicuous and often go unnoticed by most gardeners. The cultivar  Yukon Gold fruits more heavily than most other potato cultivars.  	Potato fruit are of no value to gardeners. The small fruit should not  be eaten, as they contain a poisonous alkaloid (solanine). The fruit are  not useful for planting purposes, as potatoes dont reproduce true from  seed.

  - Hello,I'm based in Oregon and work with small farms rather than gardens, so I'm not quite sure why I got your question. Up here we often prune and tip tomatoes to slow down vegetative growth about this time of year and encourage more fruiting. That helps us get more fruit before the end of the growing season. In your area the best technique would depend on the length of your growing season and the variety (i.e. determinate vs. indeterminate). I would recommend you refer to this UC publication and get an opinion from the advisors at your local Master Gardener location - I think their experience would be more relevant than mine.http://ucanr.org/repository/fileaccess.cfm?article=54222&amp;p=%20ZKXKHX You might also consider larger trellising systems. With your long growing season, I expect you could ripen a lot of fruit on a relatively large plant.Good luck - it sounds like a lot of things are going well with your plants!

## 20931_Virginia

  - The leaf problems on your early girl tomatoes appear to be from more than one cause. First, some of the spots in the pictures seem to be early blight. The one leaf with the almost sooty appearance (multiple dark areas over the entire leaf) may be from a nutrient deficiency. Let's start with the fungicide you used. I cannot find any label directions that indicate it should be used on vegetables. The recommended fungicides for use on tomatoes include copper, chlorothalonil, mancozeb, and maneb. A full service garden center should be able to direct you to products that contain one or more of these ingredients and are registered for use on vegetables. Spraying with a fungicide will not eliminate the damage that's already been done but by following label directions for use it should slow down the spread of the disease. The possible nutrient problem may be lack of magnesium but only a soil test can tell you for sure and that may not be practical for one potted plant. If you notice any additional leaves with the overall black spots similar to the one in the picture, I suggest you apply a fertilizer specifically for tomatoes and use it at half the recommend strength and rate. Over use of fertilizer can harm the plant and by not knowing what was added to the soil it's difficult to tell exactly what needs to be done. This publication from Virginia Tech gives good advice on growing tomatoes.If you have additional questions on this subject, please use the reply feature within this email or call your local office of Virginia Cooperative Extension at (540) 245-5750.

  - Dear Gardener,Blossom end rot is caused by extremes in watering and/or poor calcium distribution in the plant. You can remove the affected fruits and take some steps to try to correct the adverse conditions.This problem can be caused by several factors. Too much fertilizer is one possible cause. Be especially careful when applying nitrogen or phosphorus. I suggest using only well-aged compost rather than chemical fertilizers for most plants. A more common cause is uneven moisture: too much, too little or alternating both. Tomato plants require about 1.5 inches of water per week during fruiting, and this includes irrigation and rainfall. Use a rain gauge, and water slowly and deeply. A drip hose is best because it keeps the foliage dry and allows the moisture to sink into the soil gradually. Allow the soil to dry down to a depth of about 1 inch before watering again.A less common cause of blossom end rot is calcium deficiency, but this is generally associated with a low pH. Sometimes there is plenty of calcium in the soil, but with a pH below 6.5the plant is not able to take up the calcium. A soil test is recommended before amending the soil.I hope this information is helpful.Best Regards,

  - Tomato pruning is optional. You may leave your plants as is and still harvest plenty of tomatoes. Pruning also consumes lots of time that you might want to spend doing something else.Tomato plants fall into two growth pattern catagories, determinate and indeterminate. Determinate plants grow only a predetermined amount and that is it. They are well-behaved and you do not want to prune them. Indeterminate plants will continue to grow until the end of the season. They are not as well behaved. Before you go any further down the tomato pruning path, look at the seed packets or the plant tags to figure out whether your plants are determinate or indeterminate.Here are some reasons for pruning. 1. You can no longer reach the fruit it is so high and you don't want to climb a ladder. 2. Leaves or fruit are on the ground where slugs will get to them. 3. A diseased or broken branch should be pruned out.Towards the end of tomato season in September, you might want to prune back the flowering clusters to force the remaining green fruit to ripen prior to the cool temperatures and the rain.Tomatoes send out new shoots from the crotch between the stem and leaf branches. Pinch out these shoots before they are 3 to 4 inches long. After that it is best to just leave them alone.Stake the tomatoes and enjoy the summer from a lawn chair in the shade.

You may receive a short survey after the answer to this question.Some tomato cultivars have curling of the leaves that is a normal genetic feature of those plants. However, often curling and distortion of leaves and stems is a sign of herbicide exposure or injury. It is impossible to tell for sure without seeing your plants.

  - From your photo it looks like the tomatoes were subject to one or more foliar diseases such as early blight and/or septoria, and gray leaf spot. All produce spots   or lesions on     leaves, start at the bottom of the  plant and progress   through the     season if conditions are right, to  defoliate tomato plants   (spotting,     yellowing, dying.) You can remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing and spray with a copper fungicide (early in the season)  to  lessen spread of the disease. It is too late to spray this season. Fungicide treatments can help to protect  new or un-infected foliage they are not curatives.

## 21217_Michigan

  - Tomato diseases result in marking of the leaves and/or fruit.Rolled leavesare a physiological problem (not a problem caused by insects or disease). The edges of the leaves roll upward and inward. They may roll so completely that the sides touch each other. This problem is the result of irregular water supply to the plant. Symptoms are intensified by pruning. Correct the water problem, and the plant should return to normal.Irregular water supply to a tomato plant will not cause the flowers to fall off. If flowers are not pollinated, they fall off. Tomatoes are wind pollinated, so if the plant is in a sheltered area, there may not be enough wind to cause the pollen to float around.If any twisting, curling, or elongated stem growth is associated with the leaf curling, the problem could be damage from 2,4-D, a broadleaf herbicide that is put on lawns. In warm weather, the material can turn into a gas soon after application and make contact with susceptible plants, such as tomatoes. If the dose is light enough, an affected plant eventually grows beyond the problem.

  - If this is happening primarily on the lower stems (which it seems per your photo), and the top / middle of the plant seems healthy, it's merely natural 'aging' - prune off the older, yellowing stems. However, if it's happening all over the plant, you have either a bacterial or viral infection on the plants. Once a tomato (or most short-lived veggies) get any infection, it is- to be honest - too late to fix; you need to pull out the plants, destroy them, and try again next year. Hopefully your problem is merely the former - just the natural aging of the lower leaves, which need to be pruned off. It's natural to see some curling in tomato leaves in mid-summer; the plant does this as a defense mechanism to preserve water on hot days.

  - Hello,  It sounds like you have used too much compost, unfortunately, and that the plants are burned. Mamixum amount of compost should only be 10% of the soil mixture. There's really nothing you can do at this point beyond planting some new ones in a different area. We recommend that you have the soil tested early next spring. In order to restore the area you are speaking of to a healthy condition, you can try leaching it with lots of water. If the salt content is too high from the compost, you can add sulphur and/or gypsum to the soil, 1-2 pounds per hundred square feet.

  - Sounds like juglone toxicity. Tomato roots go much further than a foot into the soil so a 12" raised bed isn't going to make a lot of difference. the squash, beans and carrots aren't affected by juglone so they should be ok. I would suspect the peppers would start to be affected soon as well, although they are not quite as susceptible as tomatoes so it would take longer or symptoms to show. If that is the case there is nothing you can do about this, other than to grow your tomatoes in large containers next year or grow them further away from the walnut tree.

  - Difficult to say; this could be due to a multitude of possible factors- but when plants (any type)produce a lot of foliage but little fruit, the main culprit is too much Nitrogen in the soil. You could also have a lack of bees, i.e., poor pollination. Tomatoes are native to South America and love heat, so I doubt if the temperature is a problem. Also "little tomatoes, little problems; big tomatoes, big problems...." -- it's absolutely true that cherry tomatoes have far less growing problems than the larger varieties.

So I can't give you a specific disease or pest to point to, but I will suggest you look at the Tomato Diagnoistic Key at Cornell to point you in the right direction. (http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/DiagnosticKeys/TomKey.html).If you haveany photos oradetaileddescriptiononhowtheproblem progressesthatwould beof helpin narrowingit down.Forinstance,if yousawsmall brown spots on the leaves,there areseveraldiseases thatmight bethe cause, but if yousaidthespotsgrewin sizeandappearedlikeabullseyeof light anddarkbrownconcentric circles, thenI couldsuggest youhadearly blight.I don't have many details on your garden, but I always suggest using a 3 year rotation plan of where you put your tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, etc. This helps break disease or pest cycles. I also suggest if you have any diseases or dying plants, to remove them from your garden and not use them to create compost. I hope this site helps you identify your problem this year and leads to better tomatoes next year.

  - The photo of the tomato shows the foliage may be affected by early blight, a fungal disease. You may also want to look for spider mites, a sucking insect. We cannot see a wilt disease.  Some reasons for wilt include overwatering, underwatering, are they  located in the vicinity of a black walnut tree, and possible wilt  diseases.  See our publication on tomatoes for symptoms and causeshttp://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoe...Early blight  produces spots   or lesions on     leaves, start at the bottom of the    plant and progress   through the     season if conditions are right,  to   defoliate tomato plants   (spotting,     yellowing, dying.) You  can remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease,  keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base  of the plants, provide adequate spacing and spray with a copper  fungicide (early in the season)  to   lessen spread of the disease. It  is too late to spray this season. Fungicide treatments can help to  protect   new or un-infected foliage they are not curatives.

  - There are lots of possible explanations for why you are seeing few tomatoes this year.Assuming your plants are receiving enough sun, it may be that some of your varieties are late season ones, and have yet to start blooming. It was a late spring and it has set many plants back by a few weeks. In addition, that cool weather may have caused some of the flowers to drop off.You may be fertilizing them incorrectly - either too little or too much. Tomatoes are heavy feeders and usually do need fertilizer unless your soil is very rich. Choose a fertilizer that has a nutrient ratio where the middle number (phosphorus) is larger than the first number (nitrogen), such as 2-3-1.Too much nitrogen will produce lush leaves, but will depress fruit production. Lack of adequate water, or inconsistent watering will cause blossoms to drop.Tomatoes are self-fertile. That means that the pollen produced by a flower can fertilize its own pistil to produce fruit. If the pistil becomes fertilized, it will produce a tomato. If the pistil is not fertilized, the bud will drop from the plant. The problem lies in the fact that though tomatoes are self-fertile, they don't fertilize themselves very well. They need wind or bees to help the process along. If you use pesticides in you yard or garden you may be killing of the insects that do the pollination.Extreme temperatures, above 90 degrees or below 55 degrees, for extended periods will make blossoms drop off without setting fruit.Then there are disease problems but you have not mentioned that you are seeing any problems here.I hope this is helpful. Please contact AaE again if you have further questions.

## 21650_Pennsylvania

  - Your problem could be "water wilt". Tomatoes are highly susceptible to "water wilt," and         especially so when grown in poorly drained soils.The question is frequently asked, "Why are my tomato plants wilting?         I thought they loved water." In most cases this is true, but too         much of a good thing leads to problems when gardens with poorly drained         soil receive rainfall almost every day.        The first signs of "water wilt" is a slight wilting of foliage         in the top of plants. Wilted plants cannot survive when exposed to waterlogged         soil conditions even for a few days and quickly decline. Three or four         days of wilt as a result of soggy soils often leads to plant death.         Under soggy soil conditions, tomato roots use up available supplies         of gaseous soil oxygen and carbon dioxide levels rapidly build up. Roots         of tomato plants can't survive without oxygen, and root death leads to         plant wilting. Peppers and other vegetable crops are also susceptible         to         "water wilt."         If saturated soils dry quickly enough, tomato plants suffering the effects         of "water wilt" may survive. However, gardeners shouldn't count         on plant survival, since in most cases root systems have been damaged         beyond recovery and replacement with a new tomato trans- plant will probably         be necessary.         Replanting of damaged plants in a new garden location is rarely successful,         since damaged roots are frequently attacked by Pythium or Phytophthora         root rot and other soil diseases.         Water wilt is a good reason to think about making raised-row         gardening part of your vegetable production program.

  - It can be very difficult and frustrating to keep squirrels and chipmunks from eating the tomatoes in your garden. Completely fencing or caging the plants with fence wire that has holes no larger than one inch can help, such as hardware cloth (rat wire) or small opening chicken wire, but the cages or fences have to have tops on them also which then makes it hard to tend to the plants. There are repellents that will help deter them. They are best used in a rotation, one applied this time, a different one applied the next time. And they must be reapplied according to directions. Be sure any repellent you use is labeled for use on vegetables.Having food and water available for the critters somewhere at a distance from the garden will sometimes help encourage them to stay away but it is a hit and miss solution and may end up actually attracting more of them to your yard.It may not be practical for you, but growing a large number of plants, more than you need, will make the loss seem not so bad. They will eat about the same amount regardless of how many tomatoes you grow, and having an abundance means you will still have some for yourself.Unfortunately, I don't have a sure-fire answer for you. Live trapping and transporting them is illegal in Virginia. And if you kill them, the neighboring population just moves into the area to take their place. Good luck with your four legged pests. I have half eaten tomatoes scattered around my yard every day and I know how frustrating it is.

  - Dan, it looks like as disease known as Septoria leaf spot. It will defoliate the tomatoes starting at the bottom. Sunscalded fruit may result. Fungicides containing chlorothalonil or a fixed copper should help. Fungicides protect, but do not cure. Treatment should begin immediately after planting and then continued weekly through the growing season. If you can take as sample to the Lehigh County Extension office, they sdhould be able to confirm the diagnosis.Tom Ford tgf2@psu.edu

  - Even though the trees were removed there is probably residual  root material in the area.  Roots can take a long time (years) to decompose.  Walnut roots can extend in the soil well beyond the crown or drip line  of the tree, affecting susceptible plants far from the black walnut. Tomatoes are very susceptible to juglone.

  - You can't process half full jars; they need to be full of sauce to the amount of recommended head space for safe processing. Half full jars should go in the refrigerator and get consumed soon.Regarding the lemon juice, to quote the USDA's Complete Guide to Home Canning "To ensure proper acidity in whole, crushed, or juiced tomatoes (this would include sauce) add 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice per quart of tomatoes. For pints, use 1 tablespoon bottled lemon juice." Botulism can start populating your jars after three days, so since it has been two weeks we unfortunately don't recommend that you consume the jars you have canned without lemon juice.

  - Hello,Thank you for contacting Delaware Cooperative Extension. You may receive a short survey after the answer to this question.The picture shows a tomato hornworm with pupal cases of a parasite attached. The tomato hornworm is a caterpillar that is a serious pest of tomato, and will eat the foliage. Nature helps us out with this one, but means of a small wasp that is a parasite on the caterpillar. The braconid wasp lays its eggs on the caterpillar, the eggs hatch, the small wasp larvae feed on the insides of the caterpillar. As the wasps grow and develop, the caterpillar dies. By the time they are adults and ready to fly the caterpillar is done. So, although you may feel that it harms the caterpillar, it is nature's perfect biological control of this tomato pest. Of course not all caterpillars of the tomato hornworm get parasitized, so their populations are still around.My best,Nancy

A  vigilant gardener is required to see the  culprit at work so that it can  be identified. An accurate identification is critical  before a remedy  can be suggested.           I hope your plants are nearby so that  you can frequently  peak at them during the day to check what  creature  might be dining at your expense.  Also check at night, perhaps just  before you go  to bed, because slugs and some caterpillars snack at that  time.

Do you amend your soil/strawbales every year before you plant? Do you plants get the morning sun? Do you water your plants in the morning? Also if you are using the same tomato cages each year, you do need to disinfect them before you reuse them each year.

  - Its true that the vigor, disease resistance, and increased yield is highly touted for grafted tomatoes. They've been successfully used by commercial greenhouses for years. Grafted tomatoes are used in those artificial environments to avoid the many potential diseases that may occur. The growers must be on top of every small detail to avoid problems.      But I hear varying opinions from local home gardeners, varying from amazing success to not much difference. Generally, garden tomatoes hereabouts do well and normally escape the diseases common elsewhere. Questions that come to the Extension Service offices are often diagnosed as a need to adjust cultural conditions, among them water, soil preparation, fertilizer, and hours exposed to sunlight.     In your case, perhaps the graft was displaced or broken during transport home and/or the planting process. Also, consider the condition of the plants at purchase. If, when purchased, the lower leaves were yellow, tan, or dry, the plant had run short of water prior to that time and was already stressed.      Grafting Guide, a 78-page manual for commercial growers, lists additional possible causes for failed grafts on page 72. http://web.extension.illinois.edu/smallfarm/downloads/50570.pdf      So, before you again purchase grafted tomatoes, I suggest you consider what sort of success youve had with the tomatoes youve grown. If theyve been vigorous and productive, grafted kinds may not be worth the extra money.     I dont know if the nursery will refund your money. If not, consider this an experiment that has provided you with information valuable for your site and growing practices.

  - That information is generally correct, but varies wildly by variety and seasonal ,cultural and degree or ripeness when picked. Tomatoes are acidic food stuffs. Yellow tomatoes are generally slightly higher in brix (sweetness) and lower acid, but some varieties of reds are lower and some varieties of yellows are higher. I do not have tables with that kind of information nor know where that information can be found. There are well over 1,000 varieties of tomatoes. Add in the seasonal and cultural influences and I'm not sure that kind of information would be accurate or helpful. Grape tomatoes have the highest sugar content. You may want to experiment on your own and start with yellow grape and cherry types.

  - A few yellow tomato leaves toward the bottom of the  plant is nothing to worry about. These leaves probably  arent getting nutrients and arent getting sunshine. This especially happens when the plant is more mature and bearing fruit. The plant is putting most of its energy into producing fruit.  You can trim them off the plants.  However, if there are brown spots on the leaves or if the leaves are curling, etc., then you might have some kind of tomato disease. Below is a link to tomato diseases and what they look like.

  - The short answer is no!  Pruning tomatoes is not an old (or young) wifes (or husbands) tale. Other than adding to your gardening chores the benefits of pruning your tomatoes are several, many you have found in your readings. Is it necessary? No, but you will get better tomatoes if you prune (not more, but better). The priority I use for pruning tomatoes is 1) prune out damaged branches (reduces the chance of introducing disease to the healthy parts of the plant 2) branches that are touching the ground (leaves or fruit touching the ground provide a path for slug to get to the fruit before you do) 3) prune out non-fruit barring branches (will allow the Sun to get to the ripening fruit and to help air circulation to keep the leaves and fruit dry ( Helps to prevent viruses) 4) In late September to mid-October prune out branches with flowers and / or green tomatoes that do not have time to develop. The pruning will help keep the plant healthy, to get the plants energy into producing the fruit, thereby giving you better and bigger tomatoes. Dont forget to fertilize and water (especially with the heat we are having now). Good Luck!

  - Thank you for the pictures. It helps. The spots are caused by a bacterial pathogen and unfortunately, there is no control for this. There are two different bacteria that can cause these types of symptoms. Based on the temperatures we have been experiencing, I suspect this is caused by Xanthomonas bacteria. This particular bacteria like high humidity/moisture and higher temperatures. This is generally a seedborne pathogen but can also survive on plant debris. Disease development is favored by high temps and high moisture. The bacteria get around within the plantings by wind-driven rain droplets and handling of plants (pruning, etc.). The bacteria get into the plant through stomates and wounds created by wind-driven sand, insect punctures or mechanical means. At this point there is no control. I would recommend cleaning up the tomato area thoroughly, leaving no plant debris and rotating out of tomatoes in that particular area for at least a year. I would also not save any seed from these tomatoes. If you have plants that are not affected, then I would cull the infected plants so the bacteria does not get spread to the healthy plants.

Please check out the website "what's wrong with my plant" to confirm the symptoms you are seeing with your plants.  http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/index.html  If this is blight you are dealing with, the fungus will remain present in the soil and it is recommended that you rotate out for 3-4 years before replanting tomatoes or potatoes.  Planting varieties that are resistant to blight, if you haven't already done so would also be recommended.  It was a pretty wet start of the summer which could contribute to fungal issues.

  - This is Septoria: bottom leaves get small dark spots that grow larger and develop a tan or gray center. The leaf turns yellow around the spot, then all yellow, then brown and then crispy and falls off. It works from the bottom of the plant upwards. It usually takes weeks for a plant to end up with clusters of leaves at the end of the branches. Fruit is unmarked unless it gets sunburned.This is late blight: Spots develop on leaves in irregular brown-purple patterns.On damp mornings, the dark spots may appear almost fuzzy.Stems are darkened in places and fruit develops bubbled, tan-brown skin. The entire plant develops a stinky, moldy odor when put into a plastic bag and smelled. The plants are dead in three or four days. The disease moves so fast you can almost stand and watch your plants die.There is no doubt that the photos are Septoria. Like all fungal diseases, it can be prevented but not cured. Many more leaves are infected before they show symptoms.Even if you start spraying now, you may not be able to stop it at this point. The best control is really prevention. Begin spraying plants in late June or when there are tiny fruit, whichever comes first. Follow label direction which usually involves spraying every 7-10 days. You must repeat if the plant is hit by overhead irrigation or it rains. The product iswater soluble. Chlorothalonil whichcan be found in Daconil or Fungonil is usually used. Serenade is an organic product that is labeled for this use but I have not talked to anyone that has used it so I do not know how effective it is.You can treat for Septoria but it is almost impossible to treat for late blight. By the time you know the plants have it, it is too late.Septoria is the most common tomato disease that I have seen for a number of decades.

  - Wilting could be something as simple as a water issue (too much or too little). But it also could be an indication of something more dire, such as verticillium or fusarium wilt. One early indicator of these diseases is wilting, especially on one side of the plant, accompanied by yellowing and curling.Because of our love of heirloom tomatoes, we sometimes forget one of the reasons to plant hybrids: that VFN tag on the label, which stands for resistance to verticillium, fusarium, and nematodes. These wilt diseases are difficult to deal with because the pathogens remain in the soil for many years. Rotate the tomatoes out of the area and plant resistant varieties. Here are references for those two diseases: Verticillium Wilt of Tomatoes and Potatoes Fusarium and Verticillium Wilts of Tomato, Potato, Pepper, and Eggplant

  - Hi -Without a sample, I cannot be 100% sure of what is happening.Early blight, though, is the most common tomato disease. This is a fungus which lives in the ground. The rain splashes soil and this fungus up on to leaves of your plant. Moisture helps the fungus group and it continues to develop up the plant from bottom to top.You cannot eliminate the fungus, but you can:1. Leave proper space between plants.2. Use newspaper or other mulch to prevent splashing of rain up onto plants.3. Prune off lower leaves when they show signs of the disease.Here is a factsheet with complete details.http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/3000/3101.html

## 22845_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/22845_Michigan
  - There are no widespread problems with tomatoes. It's the same old thing. Your friend is incorrect.If you were told that it was Verticillium on the bottom of the plants, you were told incorrectly. Tomatoes, unless they are heirloom varieties, are resistant to Verticillium and Fusarium. These kill plants completely dead almost overnight. The entire plant wilts at the same time. That's why the diseases are called Verticillium wilt and Fusarium wilt.Septoria leaf spot will kill plants from the bottom to the top but it takes longer than two weeks. Bottom leaves get small dark spots that enlarge to have tan or gray centers. A yellow halo surrounds the spot, then the leaf turns yellow, then brown and gets crunchy and drops off. It spreads up the plant.Septoria is the most common problem for many growers. It occurs the next year because those dead leaves from last year start it again. Bouncing rain or irrigation get the fungal spores to the bottom leaves and it spreads upward.This answers what you asked soI don't know what to add.

  - Hello,It could be either late or early blight, but I didn't see any lesions on the stems of the plant from the photos you sent. That doesn't mean they aren't there, but in the case of late blight, you would see brown lesions on the stems.With early blight, you generally see brown concentric rings on the leaf or fruit. From your photos, the fruit appears to be unaffected.If it is a blight, then the plant should be pulled, as the fungi can overwinter in soils. If you don't want to pull it now, you can wait until the end of the year. You can remove the leaves that are most infected and see if the fruit will develop. You can also prune lower leaves to prevent splashing.Have you made any cultural changes to how you're growing the tomatoes? I see they are covered with plastic mulch...is the irrigation working properly? Have you checked soil moisture?

## 22895_Minnesota
* askextension_tomato/22895_Minnesota
  - It is probably caused by septoria leaf blight. Mulching under the leaves to prevent water splashing from the soil in the pot on to the leaves will help. Picking  off the yellow leaves will also help and using container mix next year in the pots will help. This year has been very wet and this disease is very common and is promoted by wet weather.

## 22915_Minnesota
* askextension_tomato/22915_Minnesota
  - Several tomato diseases produce effects commonly referred to as "blight." The following management practices will reduce, but probably not eliminate, the damage they do.1. Plant disease resistant varieties. Look for letters such as VNFT on the seed packet that indicate a variety's disease resistance.2. Allow plenty of space between the plants to provide good air circulation so they dry off quickly after wetness.3. Avoid overhead watering.4. Spread mulch around the plants to keep soil from splashing onto the leaves during heavy rain.5. Remove and dispose of dead and dying leaves.6. Remove diseased tomato plants after the growing season. Do not compost them.7. Do not grow tomatoes and related plants such as potatoes and peppers in the same place year after year. Practice "crop rotation." If tomatoes are grown in containers, use fresh soil each year.8. Apply fungicides if the above measures aren't sufficient. Begin using them before any evidence of disease is present.Some years conditions are more favorable for tomato diseases than others. The amount will vary whether or not you follow the recommended management practices.

## 22950_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/22950_Colorado
  - You are correct, it is a good practice to clean all tomato cages at the end of the season.   Crop rotation is also another option in the vegetable garden as you mentioned.   There should be 4 years before any plant in the same plant family is planted back into the same spots. The main rule is that families of vegetables, i.e. solanaceous, legumes, etc, should be rotated. For example, you would not plant peppers after tomatoes, because they are both solanaceous vegetables.   If you can't avoid it, as you said it is harder to do in a smaller space,  be sure you are picking up and disposing of all plant material at the end of the season and clean all tomato cages, like you mentioned.   Also, each season make sure to plant using correct spacing between the plants and look regularly for any problems that might come up.    If you would like to plant a cover crop next year, here is a great fact sheet that outlines what to plant: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/gardennotes/244.html   Here is a fact sheet on crop rotation:  http://pubs.ext.vt.edu/2906/2906-1393/2906-1393.html  Here are some fact sheets on growing tomatoes and common tomato problems:  http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/717.html#sanitation  If you have not already done so, you may want to get your soil tested to rule out any nutrient deficiencies.

  - It all depends on what the lowest temperatures are that you have experienced. But if the temperatures did not drop into the mid to low 30's, it is unlikely."Sick" is a word that I am not understanding what you are trying to convey. Is this only dead leaves in branches?Have you had so much ran that the soil has been saturated in the last few weeks? Soaked soils could cause wilting.Are leaves spotted or marked in some way? Is this just ends on branches?Have you had a thunderstorm in the last few weeks with lightning that may have hit the ground around the garden? A lightning strike near plants (general vicinity)can cause ends of branches to wilt. Sometimes, it progresses to an entirely wilted plant. It is sudden. When a wilted stem is split in half, the pith cavity in the interior looks like a ladder... cavities between thin dividing tissue that looks like rungs on a ladder.Have more of the tomatoes or more on an individual plantwilted? Is there a large black walnut tree withing 50-70 feet of the garden?Right now, I have more questions than answers.

  - I think you may have a combination of not enough sun and too much fruit. Pick some to ripen in the house or sunny window. I have a bumper crop this year all the rain has promoted lots of growth of the vines and some of it is pretty weak. The vines grew too fast and are thin, they also have been short on sun so they are spindly and thinner than they would be if there had been more sunny days.

  - Cherry tomatoes may be canned or frozen.OSU Extension recommends removing the skin of all varieties of tomatoes before canning. Easy directions are available on page 4 of PNW 300 Canning Tomatoes and Tomato Products. http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/food-preservation Be sure to follow up-to-date instructions for processing any tomato products. Some sources on the internet or in magazines or cookbooks have not been up-dated and have processing times that could result in an unsafe product. Botulism is a risk when processing times are too short.If you have a lot of cherry tomatoes and you don't have a lot of time, you may want to freeze them with or without the skins removed. If you don't remove the skins, the skins will slip right off when the tomatoes are thawed.

  - There are so many variables at play between temperature, watering schedules, soil fertility, vegetable varieties, and timing of harvest that it is difficult to pin down an issue like flavor with one variable. That said, since this is the hottest year in about 60-70 years it would seem likely that the heat and need to water more would bethe most likely factor. What is interesting is thatlast year was also one of the hottest years in the past 60-70 years and youmentionedyour tomatoes tasted better last year. The difference between this and last year is that the low temps at night are warmer this year. That smaller diurnal difference between the high and low temps in a day does have an impact on flavorand acidity in wine grapes so it might in tomatoes too.Ihave noticed in my garden this year that the earlier season green beans were nice straight long thin beans and as the summer heat progressed the beans were shorter, lumpy, and slightly curved. That is caused by the heat.You will see as we get into cooler weather the beans will be reinvigorated and start producing nicer beans again.Observing our gardens closelymakes us aware of how every growing season is different with some crops doing better one year and not so well the next. All those factors I mentioned earlier change from year to year.

  - Hi,  This is called vivpary (meaning live birth in Latin) and is more common in certain varieties tomatoes often including the vine- ripened tomatoes. It also occurs in fruit that is overmature. I have cut and paste the following response from one of our other "Ask an Expert" responders: "What you have observed is a condition called vivipary. Vivipary in tomatoes is not uncommon, although some cultivars have a tendency for more vivipary than others. It occurs in overripe fruit when seeds have reached maturity and the natural hormone, abscisic acid (ABA), is reduced. Then, seed dormancy is lost gradually. The tomato fruit allows vivipary since the seeds do not desiccate in the moist environment inside the fruit.   Organically produced fruit and fruit grown for farmers markets is typically harvested older, and so the chance of detecting vivipary is higher.  Tomato fruit stored in the refrigerator may also be more likely to show vivipary since cold temperatures also reduce seed dormancy.I would notrecommendeating thesetomatoes.  Back to Top

  - Saving seeds from heirloom tomatoes such as Wins All is a great way to avoid buying new seeds every year. They should come true to the variety next year. Hybrid tomatoes will not produce plants the following year that are exactly like the one you grew this year. Be sure to collect seeds from a vine ripened tomato, choosing one or more of the best ones to use. Cut it in half and squeeze out the seeds into a jar. Let the let the seeds and pulp sit in the uncovered jar for two to three days. (It will get a bit smelly!) Separate the seeds from the pulp by adding water to the jar. The seeds will sink and the pulp and juice will float so pour off the top liquid, leaving the seeds in the bottom. Repeat this a few times until all the pulp is gone. Put the seeds on a paper towel and let them dry some, then place on a plate (paper is fine) until they are thoroughly dry. This will probably take several days. Store them in a cool and dry location until time to plant them next year, being sure to label them with variety and year collected.This publication gives more details on harvesting and saving tomato seeds.

  - If this is a disease, you would have leaves that were discolored or brown, too. You did not mention anything except fruit so it is probably not disease. If there is more to this you did not mention, please let me know.All tomato diseases that mark fruit also mark leaves (except one). If it is just fruit, then we are looking at a physiological problem. If you think of how the fruit grew on the plant and not what is up or down looking at the fruit on the table, if the marked sides were either up or to the sun side, this would be sun scald. Sun scald happens on plants that have foliage missing for one reason or another. It could be a leaf disease that caused them to drop. It could be that the plants have been pruned. Branches and/or leaves were removed so the fruit was hit by more sun. Basically, it cooked it a localized area.It started with a yellow areaand thenturned white. The white area is almost blister-like. Secondary fungi move into the damaged tissue to give fruit that looks like the picture.See if any of this fits because I don't have very much information to work with.

  - If the tomatoes are really ripe then some ice would probably be smart but if they are under ripe they will ripen on the way. I would just watch them. If where you store in the car is air conditioned they will be best at room temperature but if the car gets really hot then ice would keep them from spoiling. Tomatoes lose a lot of good flavor if refrigerated but you sure don't want them to get over ripe on the way there. I would just check them from time to time and you can always add ice.

  - Thanks for your question! Sorry for my delay in responding.  While the procedures on the Splenda site seem appropriate, I was unable to find a similar recipe in any of the approved sources so I can't recommend it. That, however doesn't mean you shouldn't try it (because it does sound interesting!), it just means that I wouldn't trust that it is safe to can and store on the shelf. What you could do is make a batch and enjoy it fresh (since it only makes 3 half pints worth - if its yummy enough, that wouldn't last long), or you could also make a batch and freeze it for later.  That is usually our recommendation for when salsa recipes don't fit the "approved" status.  The difference that fresh vs. frozen raspberries might have would be in the liquid content, consistency, and possibly the texture of the finished product, but shouldn't affect the measurements or the flavor.

  - It sounds like temperature is your problem, but it is difficult to diagnose without more information and/or photos.  However, tomatoes do not grow well below 60F.  Optimum temperatures for tomatoes is between 70-75F.  If you temperatures outside are dropping down to 50F, it is likely your greenhouse/high tunnel is below 60F.  Do you use any row cover on your plants inside?  This can provide you a couple of extra degrees of protection which may make the difference.

  - It is hard to guess what disease this is without more information. Is this progressing slowly or rapidly? What do the leaves look like...little spots or big spots or dark areas on stems?Right now, we are seeing Septoria leaf spot, late blight, and early blight in the state. If the problem is late blight, the plants will be dead in a couple of days. Both late and early blight mark fruit; Septoria does not mark fruit.

## 23528_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/23528_Michigan
  - By your description it sounds like Late Blight (Phytophthora infestans). It also kills potato plants that are in the same family. This disease kills very rapidly. If purplish lesions appear on the stems, the plant goes down in less than a week. The fruit gets a brown almost bubbled-looking skin in places. Control is going to involve destroying plants and fruit by burning or burying somewhere they are not ever getting dug up. You also might considering spraying plants next year preventatively. Use chlorothalonil and follow the label directions, starting in late June.Late blight was initiated by the cool, damp weather we have had. When night temperatures are in the forty's and fog lays on the gardens, it is a recipe for late blight disaster.

  - The purple-red circles on the tomato fruit were likely caused by environmental conditions (such as weather) or a disease. It's unlikely the spots were caused by pesticide that drifted from a nearby farm field. Since the exact cause cannot be identified, we cannot make a recommendation on the edibility of the tomatoes.

## 23642_Michigan

  - You need to destroy the plants by burning or burying them some place you are not going to dig up for a long time. If the dead plant material goes into the compost pile, it will be ready and good for next year. But late blight is very much dependent on the weather. It takes cold nights, like we had, and lots of air humidity. We had that, too.You can prevent late blight and other tomato fungal diseases by preventatively spraying with a fungicide beginning in mid-June or when the tomatoes get their first small fruit, whichever comes first. Use a fungicide containing chlorothalonil. This is applied every 7 to 10 days. You have to reapply after it rains and if you are using overhead irrigation.Be sure to spray the bottoms of the leaves as well as the tops.I have no information on how successful the organic fungicides are.

  - This is most likely a ripening disorder brought on by the environment. We have had a variety of weather this year from cool to a recent week of 90s; from dry to now very wet. Extremes in environmental conditions often lead to uneven ripening of fruit, especially in tomatoes. One condition is know as "yellow shoulders". As we cannot control the weather, you can keep track of varieties to see if one is more affected than another and avoid planting that variety in the future.

  - I believe there are several things going on with your tomatoes.  One; from the clue you gave me on their height, I believe you are using a fertilizer for your tomatoes that has too much nitrogen (the first number).  A good tomato fertilizer has relative low nitrogen, under 10%, and has micro-nutrients to help support good flavor, color and internal fruit growth.   The internal problems you are seeing is internal blossom rot which is caused by several problems one being too much nitrogen fertilizer, soil going from moist to dry and being dry too long.  If you added any manure to the soil it can also contribute to this problem by raising the soil salinity level.  Wyoming soils are typically high in soil calcium so I dont believe adding any to your soil will help.   The white-ish spots look like hail damage (we had 6 hail events this summer).   Some tomato growing tips:  do not use overhead watering as that can cause various disease issues, rather use soaker hose or drip tape on the ground and water only at the roots.  Tomatoes like their soil hot use black plastic on the ground to achieve this.  Use a fertilizer with numbers like: 5-10-5, 8-10-8 or 5-8-4, importantly low nitrogen is best.  Do not use manure based compost or manures (cow/sheep in a bag) as the salt levels are damagingly high.  Do use peat moss, leaves or kitchen waste. Do not lime the soil.   I hope all this helps you have a better growing season next year.

  - There are several diseases that could cause the symptoms that you are seeing. Early blight and Septoria leaf spot are diseases that can survive overwinter in the crop residue so cleaning out the garden will be helpful. Moving the location of the tomatoes in the garden each year will also help. These diseases typically start to develop on the lower leaves when the plants start producing fruit. It is important to start using copper or any other fungicides before you start seeing symptoms. Also make sure that you get very good coverage because these products will only protect the surfaces which they come in contact with.Late blight is a very different disease that was particularly devastating this season.

  - We notice uneven ripening in your photos as well as possible insect/animal damage. Uneven ripening can occur for several reasons such as cold temperatures; varietal characteristic-especially on large fruited and plum type varieties; and weak unthrifty plants which includes poor soils and plants too crowded or neglected. You can harvest tomatoes as soon as you see a blush color and let them ripen on your counter.Also, if the tomatoes were subject to insect/animal damage that section can lead to a brown necrotic spot and rot. All you can do is cut that section out.It is a good idea to rotate your crops if you have a large enough location.

  - Late blight affects living plants. There is nothing to do with the soil this year or nextbecause the soil cannot be treated to remove it. You need to take all diseased plants and plant parts and burn or bury them. Do not put them in a compost pile or throw them in the woods or anywhere where this fungus can come back next year.What you need for late blight to happen another year is to have the three legs of the disease triangle happen. You need plants that can get late blight... tomatoes and potatoes... and you need the disease... you met I...t and you need the correct kind of weather to make it happen. The weather is cool nights andhigh air moisture. Cool days also help. This summer with air moisture and nights dropping into the forty's and fifty's was the key.Next year, we need the same three legs for late blight. But if you do not want to have plants getting any tomato diseases, begin spraying the plants at the middle orend of June or when the plants get their first tiny tomatoes. You will be using chlorothalonil and follow label directions which usually mean repeating every 7-10 days. Repeat after it rains and do not overhead water plants. Chlorothalonil is water soluble. You can prevent fungal diseases; you cannot cure them.

Since you did not give any information, I cannot tell you which one it is. They all have different symptoms.To prevent fungal problems with tomatoes, next year in mid to late June or when the tomatoes get their first tiny fruit (whichever comes first) begin a spray program with a fungicide containing chlorothalonil. The labeling indicates that you need to spray every 7-10 days and repeat after a rain or if you use an overhead irrigation system.At the end of the season or when the plants are dead, tear out and burn or bury the diseases material. It is usually what starts it the next year.Spraying the soil will not give any results, regardless of the fungicide. You need to protect live, growing plants. That's what fungicides are intended to do. Rotating plants usually don't give much in the way of control...neither does mulching.

  - Clorox is recommended for disinfecting materials used around the plants, such as stakes and tools. However, it will only disinfect the surface of fruits and tubers. Once Late Blight is visible, it has been internalized within the fruit or tuber and will not be affected by a clorox bleach solution. Nor would you want clorox bleach to get into your fruit or tuber, because it is not safe to consume. It is not likely that washing will have an effect on the disease presence on either vegetable. If you wish to store your potatoes, keep them as they are, and wash only before eating. It is hard to tell if Late Blight is in your potatoes until they start melting down and smelling bad. You must check on them regularly to remove these symptomatic potatoes throughout the storage period. Otherwise the pathogen will infect the other stored potatoes immediately surrounding the infected one.However, if you have other reasons to clean your produce with bleach, Ohio State University recommends using 3/4 tablespoon per quart of water for 2% chlorine products.  For 4% chlorine,  use 1 teaspoon per quart of water. For 6% chlorine, use 1/2 teaspoon  per quart of water. Then, rinse thoroughly with safe drinking water.

  - Oh My, how did you can them?  If you followed a research based salsa recipe it should have had a lot of either vinegar or lemon juice in the recipe.  For tomatoes they recommend bottled lemon juice or citric acid for safety.  There is no home test to determine if it is safe or not.  I would be sure to label the jars really good so no one opens them and tastes them before they are boiled for 10 minutes.  If you use the tomatoes in a cooked dish that boils for at least 10 minutes like soup and stew then they would be safe. Please download reliable tomato and salsa canning recipes and instructions.  You can find them on the OSU Food Preservation website.  Canning tomatoes is PNW 300 and Salsa is PNW 395.

  - We have a good corn relish recipe that might be just what you are looking for. You could use the same quantity of hot peppers in place of the bell peppers to make it more spicy.    http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can_06/pickled_corn_relish.html    Keep in mind that spices can be safely added or subtracted from recipes without affecting their safety, so you could leave out the turmeric or add cumin or chili powder to make it more to your specific taste.    We are not able to analyze other recipes for safety for canning nor do we suggest adding vinegar or lemon juice to try to make a recipe safe for canning. All recipes we publish have been carefully tested in a reliable food laboratory for pH and heat transfer and then reviewed by a processing authority to make certain they will be safe for home canning.    Good luck!

  - Thanks for your question. We were glad to help with your squash.Unfortunately, I'm afraid I'm going to be less help with your current problems. Let's take them one at a time.Your tomatoes look to have a serious wilt disease. It is very difficult to diagnose with just photos, even closeups, but the pattern looks like fusarium wilt. It could also be late stages of early blight or septoria leaf spot. Control is mostly the same, and cultural. Cleanup in the fall and don't compost. Don't water overhead and don't water at night. Stake plants and don't plant too close together. Mulch. Plant resistant varieties. Don't plant in the same place every year. Don't work around the plants when they are wet.http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/#tomatoesLet me also add some things about fusarium. This disease is more troublesome than the other two. It stays in the soil for several years. Many hybrid varieties are resistant (the F in VFN). So the suggestions to move your tomatoes and to plant resistant varieties hold especially true for fusarium.http://ohioline.osu.edu/hyg-fact/3000/3122.htmlI'm afraid your cucumbers are too far gone to make a diagnosis. It could be powdery mildew, or a bacterial wilt, or squashvineborer,or something else.

  - We do not recommend that people can tomatoes that have spoilage issues. It could result in spoilage of the final product due to changes in pH (acid levels) in the remaining portions of the tomatoes. This includes sauces and salsas with other ingredients.  However, you could make the desired products and safely freeze them, since there are not safety concerns with acid levels in frozen foods, like there are in canned foods.  Be sure to cut away any spoiled portions of the tomatoes before use and cook the products well. Check the instructions on the sprays you used to make sure they were followed correctly so no possible toxins from the sprays remain in or on the tomatoes.

  - Hello and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert. You are not alone in your tribulations with tomatoes. This is the most common problem we hear of in our office. In fact, our Community Horticulturist just wrote a short article about it. I have attached a link (it is the last page in the newsletter). Many conditions can contribute to Blossom End Rot, including the variety of tomato you plant. Some are more resistant to the condition than others. Our very hot weather also makes it hard to maintain an even moisture situation, especially in a raised bed. However, calcium imbalance always seems to be involved and you can try to remedy that by spraying a calcium solution directly on the leaves of the plants (not during hot sun times) as mentioned in the attached article. For the future, you might try having a soil sample tested for pH. You can do some soil additions that will increase the calcium, but sometimes other minerals or soil pH can block the availability of the calcium to the plant.http://extension.oregonstate.edu/yamhill/sites/default/files/mg/newsletter/grapevine_sept14_0.pdfhttp://

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to a number of leaf diseases that usually  appear when fruit begins to form and become severe in late summer when  conditions are favorable.  The following management practices will reduce, but probably not eliminate, the damage they do.1.    Plant disease resistant varieties. Look for letters such as VNFT on  the   seed packet that indicate a variety's disease resistance.2. Allow plenty of space between the plants to provide good air circulation so they dry off quickly after wetness.3. Avoid overhead watering.4. Spread mulch around the plants to keep soil from splashing onto the leaves during heavy rain.5. Remove and dispose of dead and dying leaves.6. Remove diseased tomato plants after the growing season.  Do not compost them.7.    Do not grow tomatoes and related plants such as potatoes and peppers  in   the same place year after year.  Practice "crop rotation."  If  tomatoes   are grown in containers, use fresh soil each year.8. Apply fungicides if the above measures aren't sufficient.  Begin using them before any evidence of disease is present.Some    years conditions are more favorable for tomato diseases than others.     The amount will vary whether or not you follow the recommended    management practices.After a heavy crop, the plants' energy is mostly spent by late summer. Shorter days and cooler nights slow their growth and metabolism accelerating the decline.

  - When it comes to blight on tomatoes, either early or late, we follow the recommedatations that are listed here:  http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/seasonal-topics/spring-summer/tomatoes-potatoes-late-blig... The USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning (1994 ed.)        recommends that canners select only disease-free, preferably vine-ripened, firm        tomatoes for canning. The reason for this recommendation is that fungus infestation may raise the pH of the tomato flesh to a level that makes it unsafe for canning. Our specific recommendation is that tomatoes showing signs of late blight disease  should not be used for canning. This applies even to tomatoes with only minor lesions since we cannot be sure that the infestation has spread to the interior of the fruit and the extent of internal infestation is not always clearly visible. It is safe, however, to process un-blemished tomatoes that are growing on plants with leaves, stems, or adjacent fruit that show signs of infection. But these tomatoes are at a higher risk for developing late blight lesions after they are harvested. Make sure to eat or process these tomatoes as soon as possible after harvesting. Green tomatoes picked early to ripen indoors should be regularly checked for signs of disease.

  - Hello,It's hard to say what is causing your tomato to wilt, as there can be many reasons. Is the plant actually "wilting" or are the leaves simply curling? If it's actually wilting irrigation is the most likely cause. Curled leaves are also very common and can be caused by many things from disease to the cultivar grown. The situation is complicated by the fact that your plant is grown indoors with artificial lights. Is the tomato in soil or soilless media? Also, excess fertilizer can cause plants to grow a lot of vegetative growth and not fruit. A publication below about tomatoes has many recommendations about watering and fertilizer that you may find helpful. https://ask.extension.org/expert/questions/212037Thank you for using "Ask an expert!

  - Thank you for your important question. When canning, it is important to follow tested recipes to ensure that the proper temperature is reached to kill the microorganisms (bacteria, molds, yeast) that may be present. You can find tested recipes on the Extension Service website (see below), USDA, or in an up-to-date version of the Ball Blue Book. The recipe you mention is NOT safe for canning for these reasons:  1. It has several low-acid foods in it. Low-acid foods must be processed in a pressure canner, using a tested recipe, in order to kill any botulism spores that may be present. 2.  The recipe includes olive oil. Olive oil is not recommended for canning (due to low acid and density of the item). 3. The recipe does not have a processing time (it is not a tested recipe), so is not intended for canning.You may find tested recipes on the following websites, or call the OSU Food Safety and Preservation Hotline Monday through Friday 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. at 1-800-354-7319.

  - Blight in tomatoes is a fungal disease that needs to be disposed of by burning or burial. Never feed these infected plants to cows, horses, or any livestock.  You should avoid working with infected plants when wet. Use heavy-duty plastic gloves and then thoroughly wash with soap and water once cleanup is finished.  Eliminate this disease by rotation of crops -- although this is difficult -- since potatoes, eggplant, vine crops, strawberries, or raspberries should not be grown in the same soil for four years.   For more information, go to www.ext.colostate.edu and look under Fact Sheets -- Blight in Tomatoes. Fungicide use is listed there and may help in control.

  - If the vine was not totally killed off by the frost, then green tomates may still ripen on the vine. If the frost was severe enough to kill the plant then the leaves will not be able to supply nutrients to the tomatoes. Green tomatoes canusually survive a frost without getting mushy.Some more mature green tomatoes may still ripen on the vine just as they would if you picked them and ripened them in your kitchen. Immature green tomatoes may not ripen and may not be palatable enough to eat. Red tomatoes may become soft and mushy after a frost, but they may still be used in recipes where the tomatoes are mashed. If the red tomatoes were protected from the frost, then they canbe harvested right away. If necessary, they can ripen further after being picked.

  - Cat face (or cat facing) on tomatoes is usually on the blossom or bottom end of the fruits. It is believed to be caused by some interference in the pollination of the blooms such as cold temperatures during bloom time. It is not attractive but the fruit that is undamaged is safe to eat. This publication shows some examples and describes this disorder.Concentric circles of cracks on the top or stem end of the tomato and radial cracks that start at the top and spread out down the side of the fruit are believed to be caused by excess water, especially if a dry period is followed by a heavy rainfall or watering. Some varieties are more prone to this than others. These fruits are also safe to eat, just cut away the part that is cracked. They should be harvested early since they are more prone to insect damage and rotting.If you have additional questions on this subject, please use the reply feature within this email.

  - Yes, powdery mildew of melons does overwinter in Utah. It survives on plant debris, but keep in mind that the fungal spores can spread long distances. The only step to take now is to thoroughly clean out your vegetable bed of any plant debris and throw it out (do not compost). Next year, like anyone growing melons, you'll have to watch your plants closely for the first signs of powdery mildew. At that time is when you need to take action. Remove leaves that are infected, spray the plants with potassium bicarbonate every 7 days (Monterey BiCarb), and make sure plants and leaves are not too crowded.White fly does not overwinter in northern Utah, except in greenhouses. It may, however, be blown from the south on trade winds, or it may be introduced to your garden in the spring on infected transplants.

  - Hi:It is a seedling tomato plant of undetermined origin. It's a bit surprising that a seedling should pop up in potting mix since essentially it is a weed, and one would assume that the raw materials for the potting mix would be free of any weed issues, for obvious reasons. This is an exception, obviously. That said, tomato seeds readily survive the winter conditions in places like compost bins outdoors so I'm not surprised that it did so in that bag.

  - It wasn't a great year for tomatoes - a lot of people ended up with green tomatoes this year. They really like hot weather. Tomatoes should be pruned. If youpruned them now you might get some to ripen before the end of the growing season (althoughinPine County,it isgettingprettylate). The bestthingtodoistotopthem. Itdirectsallof theenergyintoripeningthefruitrather thangrowing. If you have them in some sort of hoop house you might get them to last long enough outside to ripen. It is possible to ripen them inside. If you put them in a brown paper bag with an apple or a banana, they will ripen. Check the bag regularly to remove ripe and rotting tomatoes. http://umaine.edu/cumberland/files/2012/10/Pruning-Tomatoes.pdf

  - You are correct-as stated in our fact sheet 9.341Canning Tomatoes, it states "To ensure safe acidity in whole, crushed or juiced tomatoes, add 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon of citric acid per quart of tomatoes. For pints, add 1 tablespoon bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid."     It is NOT recommended to use fresh lemon juice due to possible variation in strength / acidity.Use only bottled lemon juice.

  - Tomato products can be questionable in terms of safety when processing, so it is important to follow tested recipes and processing instructions. If there are no processing instructions, it either means the recipe creator has not gone to the trouble to have the recipe tested and then have processing times determined or processing results in a product that is not desirable, such as becoming runny or lumpy. You might check with the author so see if they have any further information.    There is a Red Tomato Jam in the Ball Blue Book that may be close to what you are looking for. Spices are always optional in preserving, so you could spice it to your taste.    Red Tomato Jam.

  - Hello,Are you growing tomatoes indoors currently? Or are you thinking of next year in the garden?Do you have an idea of what variety you're growing? Are they indeterminate or determinate? Determinate tomatoes, for the most part, do not need pruning as they stay compact and produce much of their fruit at one time. Indeterminate tomatoes grow and set fruit for much of the summer, so pruning can be of benefit.I did find this excellent PDF on pruning tomatoes from theUniversity ofMaine, which explains it in more detail: http://umaine.edu/york/files/2014/11/Pruning-Tomatoes.pdf

  - Holiday cacti include Thanksgiving, Christmas, and Easter cacti.  Thanksgiving and Christmas cacti depend on short daylengths and cool temperatures to set flower buds. Thanksgiving and Christmas cacti grow vegetatively during the long days of summer and produce flowers when days become shorter in fall. Thanksgiving and Christmas cacti will not bloom  properly if exposed to artificial light at night in fall.  Flowers may  also fail to develop if the plant is exposed to temperatures above  70F.  Night temperatures of 60 to 65F with slightly warmer daytime  temperatures are ideal for flower formation.  Inconsistent or poor care is stressful to plants.  Holiday cacti respond to stress by shedding some of their growth.  Good, consistent care should help restore plant health and stop the loss of foliage.  Proper cultural practices for holiday cacti and other information can be found at the following website.  https://store.extension.iastate.edu/Product/rg308-pdfTomatoes (including cherry tomatoes) should be planted in a different location each year. Early blight, Septoria leaf spot, and other fungal diseases on tomatoes overwinter on plant debris in the soil.  Planting tomatoes in the same location year after year often results in greater disease problems.  Ideally, rotate  crops so that tomatoes and other solanaceous crops (potatoes, peppers,  and eggplants) are not grown in the same area for 3 or 4 years.

  - There are a number of fungal diseases that attack tomatoes, and they have been more prevalent in the last couple of years. The disease you describe could be Septoria Leaf Spot. The following website describes the most common diseases and includes some photos. By looking at the site and reading the descriptions you can diagnose your problem.   http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/tomato_diseases_are_on_the_rise   Fungicide applications will help to control these diseases. The following website lists some common fungicides that can be used on tomatoes. It is very important to remember that these fungicides are preventative. They will not cure a plant. Therefore it is important to start spraying when the very first tiny tomatoes are forming on the plants. You will also need to repeat applications as indicated on the label of the fungicide that you select.   http://migarden.msu.edu/uploads/files/E3170_-_Tomato_Diseases_in_the_Home_Garden.pdf   I hope this information has been helpful. If you do decide to use a fungicide please read and follow all the directions on the product label. If you have additional questions please reply back. Thank you for using our service.

'Blight' means something else, and can be very common and relatively manageable in our area.As you may know, 'disease resistant' does not mean disease proof. We would suggest that you look for a VFN designation which has a  subscript '1,2,3' after the 'F' for the highest level of disease resistance.We'd also suggest taking a look at the info and photos on our IPM Tomatoes publication: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomatoe... and the photos under Common Problems: http://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetables/common-problems-vegetablesFinally, please feel free to contact us immediately here during the growing season (photos are a huge help) so we may assist.The stunting of cucumbers is usually related to a pollinator problem.cm

  - The reasoning behind rotating crops is not only for soil fertility, but also to break the life cycle of diseases and pests that affect crops that are in the same plant family such as tomatoes and potatoes. You could be setting yourself up for problems by continuing to plant the same plant family in the same space year after year. http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-wilts-fusarium-wilt-verticillium...All is not doom and gloom though, you might consider planting these crops in large containers using fresh soil each year. Containers could be placed in the sunniest spot of your yard. Sanitation is also important. Each autumn, clear out old plant debris and send it away in the yard debris bin. Commercial operations are able to hot compost yard debris which kills the problem pathogens.You can improve the garden soil by planting a mixed cover crop each fall to be tilled under in spring. This fixes nitrogen in the soil and adds organic matter.http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/19682/ec1561.pdf Also, you might consider fertilizing your garden with liquid fish fertilizer. It is organic and plants respond well to it. Happygardening.

  - There is no garden treatment that effectively destroys disease pathogens in the soil. Most disease pathogens are host (plant) specific.  Diseases that affect tomatoes won't attack most other vegetables.  (Tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers are members of the same plant family.

  - Late blight requires several things to make it happen: any kind of tomato or potato plant, the right weather conditions which involves cool and damp, and a source of the disease. There were several times last summer when we had the conducive weather conditions with cool, almost cold, nights and fogs or mists.Late blight does not overwinter if the plant debris has been frozen. It could overwinter if infected potatoes were left in the soil and they did not freeze and were dug up the next year.There are no tomatoes that have any resistance to late blight. Your choice is to protect them with a fungicide before the plants get late blight. That means beginning to spray plants just as they arestarting to create small fruit or at the beginning of July, whichever comes first.Most directions indcate spraying on a 7-10 repeat. Repeat after a rain and do not overhead water the plants. The fungicides are water soluble. If you are a traditional gardener, you can use a fungicide that contains chlorothalonil. If you are an organic gardener, you can use a fungicide containingcopper hydroxide. There is another organic product called Serenade but I have not talked with any gardeners that were pleased with its performance so keep this in mind if you use it.The soildoes not need to be treated and there is nothing to treat it with. This is a disease that floats in the air. If dead plants were destroyed by burning or burying somewhere they will not be unearthed, it should be enough. Wild plants in the nightshade family can get the disease but it is rarely fatal to them.The big thing is the weather. If we do not have cool, damp weather, chances are small there will be a problem.

## 28593_Kentucky

  - There are several things I would do to lessen early and late blight. First you might want to select tomato cultivars with resistance to these diseases. They are listed in the Ky. Vegetable tabloid and in a cultivar recommendation publication available at your Extension office. I would plant my tomatoes allowing plenty of space between them. Air movement and sunlight will keep the foliage dry. I think mulching the plants helps keep fungal spores from splashing up on the foliage. In the second week aftertransplanting I like to remove some of the foliage close to the ground. This foliage is most vulnerable to early blight. Next I would spray with Chlorathalonil. Be sure to follow label directions

  - In fact tomato leaves are toxic to horses. Tomatoes are in the same class of plants as nightshade, and the leaves have similar toxic effects in horses. The main effect is disruption of normal gut motility, and horses that have consumed significant quantities of tomato leavesmay show signs of colic.The good news is that horses don't normally like the taste of tomato leaves, so unless there isno other green vegatationaround for a horse to eat, he will usually not select tomato leaves due to unpalatability.

  - First, you need to rotate what you plant in your raised beds.  Tomatoes take a lot of nutrient out of the soil, similar to kale.  You should only plant tomatoes in the same location once every four years.  Attached is an article on the benefits of crop rotation.  It sounds like you have more than one bed, so you can split them into quadrants. This will help your garden beds become more sustainable and also help prevent pests and diseases from getting a foothold. I suggest you consider taking a soil sample to determine if your pH is correct and what your nutrient base is. Once you have that information you can amend the soil as needed.  http://extension.oregonstate.edu/gardening/rotating-crops-garden-may-help-fight-disease

  - Sam, Yes, they should grow OK. Typically the way to harvest the seed is to mash up the fruit pulp with seeds with some water.Keep it in a jar or bowl for 2-4 days, stirring with a spoon. The good seeds will sink while the bad seeds and pulp will float. Remove the good seed, try your best to separate and allow to air dry for a week or so before storing. As long as the two varieties of tomatoes were far enough apart, the plants should come true from seed if neither is a hybrid. Tomatoes can be self-pollinated by wind and rain or by insects too, which can lead to cross-pollination.  A heat mat can be very useful in germinating the seeds.We are getting close to the time to plant the seed. Remember that they need lots of light, once they start growing. Give them full sun indoors if you can or use grow-lights, either fluorescent or LED. After danger of frost is past you can plant them in the garden. They should flower and fruit just like other tomato transplants you buy from other sources.

  - I assume you are referring to the disease, late blight, and had it diagnosed?  The pathogen overwinters on crop debris, so hopefully you cleaned out your garden good last fall.  For this year, it would be a good idea to plant blight-resistant varieties, such as Mr. Stripey, Black Plum, Big Rainbow, Mountain Magic, Plum Regal, Matt's Wild Cherry, Defiant, or Iron Lady. (you can search for more varieties online).The disease is really dependent on weather, and does best in cool, most springs. If the spring is warm and dry, there should be little incidence of disease. Be sure to keep plants pruned for aeration, and do not let irrigation water land on the leaves.

  - Successfully growing tomatoes in a space previously dedicated to daffodils is possible if the garden bed meets a tomatos requirements for soil, light, and water.     The Oregon State University Extension publication, Growing Tomatoes in the Home Garden, describes what a tomato needs.    Ohio State Extension has a publication, Growing Hardy Bulbs, which describes what a daffodil needs.    You may want to compare the two sources, looking for similarities and differences and then add in what you know about the planting site.   Your question does not explain if you plan to continue using the bed for daffodils as well as tomatoes. If so, it may be difficult to synchronize the two distinct crops. For example, the daffodil foliage may not have fully died back before the most optimum time to plant tomatoes. Likewise, the tomatoes may still be producing when it is time to plant daffodils.     If you want to keep the daffodils in the ground and plant tomatoes in and around them, it may be difficult to give each tomato as much room as it needs for good root development.      Here is a link to another OSU publication, Grow Your Own Tomatoes and Tomatillos, to help you through each step of the tomato planting process.

Best to work with the manufacturer of your system and to use their recommended equipment.   Our recommendation for tomatoes and most plantings is a minimum of 1" of water per week.  of course the question is well how much is 1 inch of water. Here is a calculator tool. Be sure the use the correct units of measure measurement. Using this I calculated that 1" of rainfall over a 3 x 3' area rouphly equivalent to the square footage of a tomato plant, is equal to 1.8 gallons of water. http://www.calctool.org/CALC/other/default/rainfall Another way to do this is to measure how long you need to run your system to wet the soil down to10-12" ofdepth.Allowtodryoutabitbetweenwaterings,butthisdeepwateringshouldbedoneonceaweek.

When you water,  the salts and nutrients are going directly into the soil and not benefiting the roots. An example of an organic fertilizer is cottonseed meal and there are others. Another option would be to grow the tomatoes in a container or earth box.

  - Late blight is a class called a water blight. It acts like a fungus, but is in a different category. Late blight winters over in any plant debris left from last year. It can't (yet) survive in the soil without some part of its host. When late blight occurs, it is important to bag or burn every part of the remaining tomato plants including roots, leaves, stems, and fruit. Penn State publishes a fact sheet that will give you more information.When you plant tomatoes this year, put the plants in a different part of your garden. Buy plants from known suppliers, not box stores. Locally grown plants are best. Late blight needs wet conditions to survive and spread, so be careful to keep the foliage on your tomatoes dry and mulch under them so no rain water splashes soil up from the ground onto the leaves. Only water at the soil level, not with an overhead system that wets the leaves.

  - There is no reason that tomatoes and spinach cannot be grown near each other.Tomatoes are a warm season vegetable and need hot weather and lots of sun. Spinach is a cool season crop that does not tolerate hot weather or it bolts (goes to seed and gets bitter). The temperature is going to play a role in its growth, not just thelight. Spinach does not need shade. It is somewhat shade tolerant. There is a difference.Typically, spinach is planted early in the season and is out of the garden in July and then replanted for a fall crop in late July or early August. Tomatoes are there for the hot stuff and struggle in cool weather.You can try growingspinach in the shade of the tomatoes and see what the results are. To be synergistic, the sum of the two togetherhave to be more powerful than each counted as a separate. I don't think this quite makes that definition. You could grow leaf lettuce in the shade of the tomatoes and it would be about the same thing. You will just have to determine if thecrop is good enough to continue doing this other years. If we have extremely hot weather, it has a bigger chance of failing.

  - Hi,  There is not much you can do if there is fungus in your soil except to wait it out (2-3 years). In the meantime you can try other crops (with the exception of those in the nightshade family:tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) in that area. If you have space, plant your nightshade vegetables in another part (the sunniest part) of your garden. You could even consider growing these in containers or straw bales. Raised beds with a barrier between the soil now in your garden and the soil you put in the beds can also help minimize the plants exposure to the fungus.

  - Blight is not a specific disease. Tomatoes do not get the same diseases that cucumber and squashget. Since I don't have any idea what the disease looked like, I can't be specific other than to say it was probably fungal.But... there is nothing you can do to the soil. Some possibilities could remain with leaf parts but the spores are dormant. They cannot be killed by spraying or putting anything on the soil. Other diseases are carried in the humid air or are transferred from one living plant to another.You could use preventative fungicides on plants if you know what the diseases were. But this is specific to the kind of plant and the particular disease. Fungicides can prevent but they cannot cure. It's also possible that the squash problem could have been insect-related.If you can describe what happened to the tomatoes, the cucumbers and the squash... each separately and when the problem occurred like July or September, I can try to see what happened. But generalized statements like "leaves died" or "got spots" don't help.Specific statements like... "tomato leaves got little dark spots on the lower leaves; leaves went yellow, then turned brown and dried up and fell off starting in July and it started at the bottom of the plant and worked itself up"is helpful.

  - The fungal disease, early blight overwinters in soil and plant debris and can also be transmitted on seed and transplants. It is typically splashed by rainfall onto lower leaves early in the season. This fungus produces spots or lesions on the leaves and progresses through the season if conditions are right, to defoliate tomato plants (spotting, yellowing, dying.)  Next season if your garden is large, rotate your tomatoes to another section but if your garden is small this may not be practical. Select resistant varieties.  See the resistant list from Cornell http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Tables/TomatoTable.html You can remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - The only reason I can think that tomatoes will not flower is   1. not enough sun, tomatoes need 8 to 10 hours of direct sunlight to flower. Tomato plants will grow with less light but not flower.    2. The soil is too full of nitrogen. A high content of nitrogen in the soil will cause a plant to just grow vegetatively instead of flowering. You can do a soil test to determine if this is the case. This sometimes happens when too much fertilizer is applied or too much compost is used in the soil amendments.   Move the plants where the plants will receive more sun.

  - Here's a link to a great YouTube video on pollinating your tomato plants using a small electric toothbrush to simulate what a bumblebee would do in the outside world.: https://youtu.be/2Fwff3oeaxcTomatoes are self-pollinating. Wind or bees carry pollen from the anthers, the male parts of the flower, to the stigma, one of the female parts of the same flower. From the stigma, the genetic material in the pollen travels to the ovary and fertilizes it. The ovary then grows to become tomato fruit. Without fertilization, tomatoes don't produce fruit.  With Hand Pollination You must pollinate during the short time between blooming and bud drop, and you must pollinate each flower cluster individually.

## 35142_Arizona

  - Hi,The problem you described is called blossom end rot and is associated with a calcium deficiency.  While the occurrence of blossom end rot may indicate calcium  deficiency, in reality, the soil may have adequate calcium. However, for  various reasons the plant may not be able to take up enough calcium to  supply the rapidly developing fruit. As a result, efforts to manage this  problem fall into two categories: pre-plant and post-plant.   Prior to planting, the main preventative measure is to have a soil  test done to determine if adequate calcium is present in the soil.  Limestone (a source of calcium) should only be applied if soil test  results recommend it. When a need for limestone is indicated, best  results are achieved when the limestone is worked into the soil 2 to 3  months prior to planting.  After tomatoes are planted, you can minimize the potential for blossom end rot by doing the following:   Once transplants become established, encourage the production of a  large root system by keeping plants a little on the dry side for a few  weeks (until they begin to flower and set fruit). A large root system is  better able to take up the calcium needed for the healthy development  of the tomato fruit. After fruit set begins, keep soil evenly moist. (Avoid extreme fluctuations in moisture levels. Do not overwater!) Apply a layer of mulch to help maintain even moisture and keep soil cooler. Do not overfertilize. Especially avoid high-nitrogen fertilizer as it can cause problems with the uptake of calcium. Do not cultivate closer than 1 foot to plants to avoid damaging roots.  If tomatoes develop blossom end rot, spray the foliage with calcium  chloride or calcium nitrate when symptoms first appear. Follow the  instructions on the label. Removing fruit with symptoms is also  recommended.  The good news is that tomato plants self-adjust after the first fruit  are set, and later fruit are typically not affected by this disorder. Peter

  - Tomatoes need full sun, which is around 8 hours a day. High temp will cause blossoms to abort. Am I understanding correctly that the main material is a row cover of spun bound material? Or is it a clear plastic? I know there is research on screening in high tunnels but they are also having problems with heat building up. All the growers I know that have high tunnel tomatoes have the side rolled up and ends open for airflow to cool them off. Greenhouse growers have cooling systems. Many disease problems in tomatoes are caused by the plants staying too wet so providing cover on the top should help with that. Stick bugs can be hard to control. All of that said, my suggest would be ventilation to help reduce the heat and see how that works. You can also give me a call at 573-883-3548 and we can talk about it further.

  - Curling leaves in tomatoes can be due to a number of things. Herbicide drift being one. Check nearby plants for signs of leaf curling. With herbicide drift, more than on one type of plant is likely to be affected. Tomatoes are more sensitive, so leaf curling and puckering may be more noticeable on them than other plants; but other plants should show some damage. Leaf curling may also be due to a virus disease. If no nearby plants are affected, a virus is a good possibility. There is no control for viruses. We recommend removing the plant to prevent transmission to nearby plants or carry over to next season. NOTE: If it is herbicide injury, new growth should look normal. If it is a virus, new growth is likely to continue to be affected. Also - leaf roll is a physiological response of tomato leaves to environmental factors - too wet of soil, too dry of soil, etc. It is harmless at this time of year and most plants eventually grow out of it. With leaf roll, the leaf will look normal if you unroll it. Let me know if you have additional questions. If you decide that this is herbicide injury, our recommendation is not to eat tomatoes from these plants.

  - Thank you for contacting Ask an Expert. Have you done a soil test before planting and do you have mulch under your plants? If you could take a picture and send itthat would help a lot, or you can bring part of the plant in to be seen. It can be anything from blight, to a bactiral disease in the soil. You may need to rotate your tomatoes to another bed where no other "nightshade" plants have been. Give me a call so we can get a little more info on this.

  - Common Diseases of Tomato will give you an overview of fungal diseases you encounter in late spring and early summer. In all cases, hygiene is the main preventative measure. You need to remove all diseased plant tissue and all plant debris that can harbor fungus. Don't plant tomatoes in the same location two years in a row in case there is fungus in plant residue from the previous year. If you have badly infected plants, it's better to remove the entire plant. Also bag or burn the diseased tissue. Scout the ground for any fruit or leaves you may overlook. Your picture looks like early blight. However, for a complete diagnosis and treatment plan, take a sample to your local Penn State Extension.

  - If you are sure this is flea beetle (http://insect.pnwhandbooks.org/vegetable/vegetable-pests/common/vegetable-crop-pests-flea-beetle) then all is not lost but you need to apply cultural controls to avoid future infestations.  From the PNW Insect Management Handbook:  "Research in California has shown that seedling damage is significantly higher in fields previously planted to tomatoes. If possible, rotate tomatoes with a nonhost crop. In fields not previously planted to tomatoes, flea beetle infestations are usually located at field borders.  "Trap crops" such as radish or daikon may help lure flea beetles away from the main crop, but this has not been tested in the Pacific Northwest. Floating row covers or other screening can be used to exclude the beetles during seedling establishment of high-value crops. Flea beetles can be vacuumed off foliage, but this must be repeated frequently. Reinvasion of plants can be rapid."  Rotating the location in a home garden can be challenging because you typically don't have the size to effectively isolate, but making sure you don't have a 'border' area where the pests could overwinter.  As long as your plants are otherwise healthy and you are ensuring even watering and fertilization, the plants should be fine.  For spraying, neem oil is one of the options for home gardener use, but it's use can impact bees so be careful of the applications and always follow the directions.  There are other options listed in the link below.  - See more at: http://insect.pnwhandbooks.org/vegetable/vegetable-pests/hosts-and-pests/tomato-flea-beetle#sthash.wZm2tDxZ.dpuf

  - The most common reason is that the tomato variety is a mealy one. Many varieties bred for large size are notorious for this. Refrigeration is also a culprit, but that doesn't sound like your issue. If the variety is usually good, cold nights or improper watering are usually to blame. You can't do a lot about the former, but making sure the plants are getting consistent water will prevent a lot of issues. Here is more on growing tomatoes in Minnesota. There is also a link to suggested varieties that you can keep in mind for next year: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/

  - Dear gardener, Thank you for contacting us. It would be very helpful if you could send a close up photo of the pests and leaves. Spider mites are typically white. My guess is that your plants are infested with aphids (see attached photo). These can usually be controlled with a strong blast of water from a hose.

## 36231_Texas
* askextension_tomato/36231_Texas
  - Looking at pics we feelit is early blight, this seems to be the biggest problem this year. One of the main causes is early high rainfall followed by heat and lots of sun. Treat early plantings with a fungicide such as daconil (or check with local nursery for organic fungicide specific for blight) continue treating 1-2 wk intervals thru growingseason. The fungus can live is soil so practice crop rotation or change soil in containers before replanting.  Please browse Aggi-horticulture.TAMU.edu under vegitables.

## 36234_Maryland

  - The disease appears to be septoria leaf spot. For a fungicide to be applied , it should be applied before the disease progresses to this stage.if the center picture is that of a leaf and not the main stem, remove them before the disease advances to the upper leaves. If the main stem is badly effected consider replanting. You still have enough growing time for a crop. http://extension.umd.edu/growit/septoria-leaf-spot-vegetablesro

  - Petetomatoes sometimes turn sour because of the variety but this can also happen when the tomato cooks on the plant. This occurs in very hot weather and when the moisture in the soil is not just right.Be sure to keep a thick mulch layer over the soil to help keep the moisture even.

## 36285_Pennsylvania
* askextension_tomato/36285_Pennsylvania
  - Hi -I would suggest removing the mulch around the base of the tomatoes especially since you do not know the source of the trees used to make the mulch. Tomatoes are very sensitive to jugalone, an allelopathic chemical that is found naturally in black walnut trees. The recent rain events could be leaching these compounds from the mulch into the soil if this is the case.In the long-term, using wood chips or mulch in a garden even if you know the source of tree can change the soil pH and tie up nitrogen so you will need to compensate for that by adding from nitrogen in the form of fertilizer or compost.Mulches can be very beneficial for the garden in terms of helping with weed control and maintaining soil moisture but I would suggest using a straw mulch or grass-clipping if you are not using some type of lawn care service or weed and feed type product.Good luck.

  - This kind of yellowing is due to insufficient iron. There is probably plenty of iron in your soil, but the plant is unable to use it. This can be caused by many conditions - most likely high soil pH or heavy wet clay soil. There is not much you can do about it. The disorderdoesnotlooktoobad onyourplant, and will most likely outgrow it. But youmight consider moving your tomatoes next year, or working in a lot of compost or manure to lighten it up, and also get a soil test to check the pH.

## 36610_Oklahoma
* askextension_tomato/36610_Oklahoma
  - The first thing that comes to mind is not enough light. Full sun loving plants need at least 6 hours of continuous sun to perform at their best. If the plant is growing in less than 6 hours of full sun it could be struggling to reach more light. Another possibility is if you bought it that way. When plants have been growing very close together in the nursery or greenhouse for a long period of time they become leggy. If you bought your tomato late in the season, perhaps as a bargain plant, it may have a difficult time returning to its normal growth habit. Make sure the plant is getting plenty of sunlight. You could also pinch it back quite a bit in hopes to force it to branch out more. Now that we are in the heat of our Oklahoma summers though, it may not produce many flowers and set fruit until late summer and fall as we begin to cool off again.

  - They may be spider mites. Spider mites thrive in the hot, dry conditions. Look for spherical, clear to yellow spider mite eggs on the leaf undersides. You may also see fine, silk webbing may be seen on the leaf underside. You can control spider mites with insecticides labeled specifically for vegetables and follow labeled days between application and harvest. Ultra-fine horticultural oil and insecticidal soap are low residual toxicity pesticides that provide control when applied thoroughly to cover plants where mites are feeding. Forceful sprays of water onto leaves may also lessen populations.   http://vegnet.osu.edu/sites/vegnet/files/imce/Sept%207%2011.pdf

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to many diseases. It would be useful to know what you are calling "blight". Not alltomatodiseasesaresoil borne;someareseedborne.Check here for some common tomato diseases:http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/Common fungal diseases such as septoria leaf spot or early blight have the same treatment: good sanitation and careful watering.In your case, I'd ask the following: where did the "new soil" come from? For tomatoes grown in pots, we recommend a sterilized soilless potting mix. How do you water? Yes, from a rain barrel, but does it splash on the plants? You "scrubbed" the pots. But did you use a 10% bleach solution on them?Andwheredidyougetyourplants?Also, the common fungal infections (septoria leaf spot, for example) rarely kill the plant and usually don't affect crop size. Furthermore, they usually don't appear until mid July or later. So I'm wondering if something else is going on. Once again, you need to determine what your "blight" is.

  - This has nothing to do with nutrients. What you are seeing is a very light dose of 2,4D affecting the plant. This is a broadleaf weed killer that is used on lawns.Tomatoes are highly sensitive to 2,4D. A weed killer could have been applied to your lawn or the neighbor's lawn.In warm weather, the 2,4D volatilizes and floats a distance and smacks the tomato.It could have been as simple as you handling a bag (open or closed)with 2,4D in it and then going to the garden and touching the plants. Or it is possible to use grass clippings from a lawn that had a broadleaf weed killer applied in the recent past.Symptoms of a light dose of 2,4D includes twisting curling or pig-tailing of leaves and stems. The leaves feel like they are made out of plastic and are much stiffer than normal. If your tomato had more contact with 2,4D it would be dead. This amount is miniscule. The damage is classic and nothing in the disease or insect world duplicates this. If it was a light dose of glyphosate, it would look different.If there is no additional contact, the growth will return to normal.Since I cannot see the bottom leaf spots, I can't even guess.

Here is some good information on curly top. http://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-curly-topYour description, however, does not match with the symptoms of curly top virus.

  - It is possible to grow tomatoes is pots. The larger the plant the larger the pot needed. Tomatoes don't suffer from many insect problems but are more pone to disease problems. By growing in pots and using new soil every year you reduce the risk of a problem. I don't know why your tomatoes became rotten but it was most likely not from insects. Make sure that you provide plenty of water since they will require more water in the pots. Choose a fertilizer that is suited for tomatoes. Too much nitrogen and you will have more leaves than fruit.

  - This sounds like a herbicide problem. Herbicide can come from drift, direct spraying or from mulch and compost material that was added to the soil. Tomatoes and peppers are very susceptible to herbicide and will show this type of symptoms. If it is from compost material or grass clippings, there will be nothing you can do this year in that area of the garden. Usually by next year the herbicide has degraded and will no longer pose a problem. Be careful when adding this material to the garden. Grass that has been sprayed for weeds will have the herbicide carryover and will carryover in the compost as well.

  - The tomato you picture has rotted spots all around the fruit, not just on the bottom.  It doesn't seem to match anything except cold damage.  It is possible there was damage from our cold evenings several weeks ago.n  The leaves could also be exhibiting signs of cold damage but it also could be an early blight.  Lower leaves should be removed in any case.  You should not have them touching the soil.  Soil contains fungus which can be transferred when it splashes up onto the leaves.

  - Hello,Thanks for your question. It looks like you are experiencing blossom end rot. Here's some information on BER from one of our Master Gardeners-Jean Natter.The fundamental causes of blossom end rot (BER) are deficiency of calcium in the plant and moisture stress. Calcium uptake by the plant may be inadequate for any of the following reasons: - There is insufficient calcium in the soil.- Excess nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, or sodium has been applied as fertilizer.- Very wet or very dry conditions interfere with the uptake of calcium.- Windy exposure and/or very low humidity- Growing in a container where root room is limited.- Some kinds of tomatoes are more susceptible than others, among them Roma.The keys to avoid BER:- Supply adequate calcium by adding lime to your soil every 2 to 3 years, the amount as directed on the package label.- Use only moderate amounts of fertilizer.- Plant in well-drained soil.- Provide adequate irrigation to maintain evenly moist soil.- When needed, temporarily protect the plants with a windbreak or with shade, the latter on a suddenly very bright, clear day.Additional resources for you:- Much of the above is adapted from Blossom End Rot. But please notice that the comment in that publication about using a calcium chloride spray is outdated information. Unfortunately, it doesnt work as hoped.http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/16949/fs139.pdf- Grow Your Own Tomatoeshttp://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/14210/ec1333.pdf- Growing your ownhttp://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/21092

  - If your plants are producing, the containers are probably adequate in size and drainage. The removal of the male flowers could have an impact on the fruit production if they are all removed. Good pollination requires at least a dozen visits from the male flower to the female flower, so it is important that not all the male flowers are removed. The rotting end of the fruit is a fungal problem known as choanephora, commonly called 'wet rot'. This malady is common during hot, wet weather and especially to fruit nearest the ground.The leaf spots may be incidental or they may be symptomatic of a fungal disease, but it would be appropriate to remove any leaves that are obviously dead or not viable.Water is an important aspect to container gardening since the soil tends to dry out much faster than in the garden. Consistent moisture is important to good fruit production. Don't overwater, but don't let the plants dry out completely before watering again.LS

Herbicide damage and extremes in temperature are the two most common causes.Here is a link to one of the University publications:http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/disorders-of-tomato/And a link that suggests the herbicide used in horse pastures contains enough residual chemical to cause these symptoms:http://www.motherearthnews.com/organic-gardening/milestone-herbicide-contamination-creates-dangerous...

  - There are several fungal leaf spot diseases that commonly infect tomatoes. This could be early blight (extremely common) and/or septoria leaf spot. If the yellow leaves are on the bottom on the plant, simply pull them off and dispose of them. These fungal disease spores splash up from the soil, so a good mulch of, for instance, newspapers covered with leaf mulch or straw, keeps the spores from splashing on the lower leaves. Other strategies may be necessary.

  - Thank you for contacting the Cherokee Co. UGA Extension Office and Master Gardeners concerning your tomato plants. It is difficult to tell exactly what the issue is from just the photo. There is a condition called leafrolling that occurs when the plants are trying to produce a lot of fruit and the weather conditions are very warm with intense sunlight. This is not a terminal condition that will kill the plant and often starts at the top. Most of our diseases show up in the bottom of the plant first. Another possibility could be herbicide damage. If a herbicide, especially Roundup, has been used anywhere near the plants, it will cause the leaf to shrivel up. I have included a good UGA paper of tomato diseases that might help.

  - The yellow leaves on the tomato plants could be due to a nutrient deficiency or some type of foliage disease. Fertilize the tomato plants with a dilute fertilizer solution the next time you have to water. A dilute fertilizer solution can be prepared by adding a water soluble fertilizer to water. If the plants have a disease, discard the soil in the pots in fall. Clean the pots. Use a commercial potting mix next spring (not garden soil).

  - This is called 'blossom-end rot' and is caused by a calcium defiency.  It is difficult to use bone meal or lime to address this now (it's better to add this at the time of transplanting, but I realize that doesn't help you now.)  There are products advertised as 'liquid calcium' that will provide a more immediately available version of calcium.   You can leave the fruit to ripen and cut off the affected portion of the fruit.  It's still pretty early in the season so you can remove the affected fruit (depending on the amount of the fruit affected.) to promote more fruit production (it is an indeterminate variety.)  Even though you have other varieties, some types may have a higher sensitivity to calcium.  It's almost impossible to overwater tomatoes, but it is important to ensure the water really soaks down to encourage deep root growth.  Next year when you plant your tomatoes, you may want to work in a cup of bone meal or lime per plant to mitigate the problem.

  - There are too many possible causes to answer this without seeing a sample or at least a photo of each affected plant. It could just be a nitrogen deficiency, or it could be a disease such as root rot, or early blight if you are also seeing brown spots on the leaves. Bring in a sample of both plant types to your local County Extension Office. There are about ten common causes of yellowing leaves in vegetables. Do a soil test and fertilize accordingly.

  - You are looking at a tomato disease, not a lettuce disease.The tomatoes have a fungal disease that is very common called Septoria Leaf Spot. It starts with the leaves closest to the soil. Little brownish spots appear and grow and the center of some of the spots turn tan or gray. The spots get a yellow halo, then the leaf turns brown and dries up and falls off. Bouncing water or insects or people touching leaves move it up the plant.To slow down Septoria, it is going to be necessary to begin spraying the plants on a 7-10 day repeat with a fungicide. If you do not, there will be no tomatoes, only a plant with little clusters of leaves at the ends of the branches.The problem is that Septoria has already spread to leaves above the yellow ones. I can see spots in the photo.If you choose to spray, cut off anddestroy the yellow leaves immediately. Wash you hands before touching anything else. Burn or bury leaves; do not put them in a compost pile where they will be back to haunt you next year.The fungicide to use is one containing chlorothalonil. It can be found in Daconil and Fungonil. Follow the directions. You are going to have several weeks where it appears you have no control because the fungus is already in leaves above the yellow ones. but keep doing it. If it rains or the plants are hit by an irrigation system,re-spray immediatelybecause this is water soluble. Use a presurized sprayer. Do not use a hose-end. Spray tops and bottoms of leaves.There is also an organic product called Serenade but I have not seen any information as to how well or if it works. It will difficult to find.It's difficult to know what the lettuce has without seeing a leaf. But if it is leaf lettuce and the spots are on outer leaves, pick them off. Don't remove more than one ring of leaves.If you need more information, call me because I am in Livingston County. Gretchen517/546-3950

  - Reasons for no fruit include too much nitrogen fertilizer ( this does not seem to be the case); High or low temperatures (poor pollination/aborted fruits with temperature extremes; and limited sunlight. If the plants receive less than 5 hours of sun and are spaced too closely this may be an issue. Also, if you have had a lot of rain you may be dealing with botrytis (gray mold). The pedicels (blossom stems) look pinched or withered. Look for this. All you can do is wait for weather to improve.

  - Tomatoes require lots of sun, warm temperatures at night as well as during the day, enough air circulation for the leaves to dry and the pollen to move around. Also, too much nitrogen will cause the plant to produce leafy growth. They like warm soil temperatures as well. I would check environmental conditions to make sure the plants are getting enough of what they need to produce fruit. Also check the variety of your tomatoes and see if they are late bloomers.

  - This sounds like blossom drop, which can result from the high daytime temperatures we have had which stress the plant and interfere with pollination,as wellasshallow watering, or a lack of phosphorus. You should be deeply watering tomatoes one to two times a week, and when temperatures are hot and there is no breeze gently shake your plants to aid the pollen in spreading. If your soil or plant food is high in nitrogen, amend with a low nitrogen, high phosphorus fertilizer.I would need to see a photo of the tiny flies to see if it is whiteflies. If they have yellow bodies and transparent wings, you can introduce lace wings and use silver reflective mulch around the plants, or chemical controls.

## 38185_Pennsylvania

  - Early blight is an extremely common disease on tomatoes. By late  July, it is often found on many tomatoes that havent been routinely sprayed by a fungicide.   Caused by a fungal pathogen, Alternaria solani, early blight  gets started on the lower leaves of tomato and potato plants. Besides  leaf yellowing, symptoms include spots or lesions that start out small  but increase in size. Larger lesions often have a target-spot or bulls  eye appearance, with concentric rings visible within the lesion.  Usually, fruit are unaffected, but when the disease starts early in the  season and conditions are favorable for continued infection, fruit can  show lesions near the stem end.  Dont confuse early blight with late blight, a far more devastating  disease that usually gets started in the upper portions of the plant,  and is characterized by large, dark, greasy-looking lesions on leaves  and stems.   What can be done about early blight? A number of cultural practices  can help keep this disease at bay. These include rotating away from  tomato or potato for a minimum of three years, tilling under any plant  residue from the previous season, spacing and pruning plants to allow  good air drainage through the plant canopy, and avoiding getting leaves  wet when watering. For the most effective control, especially during  rainy periods, apply a fungicide, taking care to get good coverage on  the upper and lower leaf surfaces, especially on older leaves. Most  fungicides that are labeled for homeowner use on vegetable gardens will  be effective on early blight.

  - This is not a disease or an insect.It looks like herbicide damage, specifically 2,4D. This is a broadleaf weed killer put into many lawn weed killers. An extremely small dose causes leaves and stems to twist, pigtail, curl and become thickened and distorted. It was not a direct application. It could have been applied to a lawn in warm weather and some of the 2,4D volatilized and floated to the garden. It could be at the neighbor's house or you could handle an unopened bag of lawn herbicide and just put your hands on the tomato plants. Tomatoes are extremely sensitive to herbicides. 2,4D damage looks like what you have and glyphosate damage (another herbicide with glyphosate) looks very different.There is nothing to do except wait and see how much is damaged. And try to find the source of how 2,4D came to the tomatoes. If it was only a light does, new growth will return to normal. If it was more, the plants may decline and stop growing.

## 38249_Michigan

  - The problem is a fungal disease called Septoria Leaf Spot. It can be found in soil or can be transferred to plants by insects or other means. It begins with little brown or blackish spots on the lower leaves. Some of the spots enlarge to have gray or tan centers. A yellow halo forms around the spot. the leaf turns yellow, then brown, then gets crispy and falls off. The broken-down leaf is one of the ways Septoria starts next year. There are a number of wild plants that can get Septoria but they do not have anywhere the problems of this annual that has origins in Mexico.You can spray the plants with a fungicide to protect them. You cannot cure them. If the disease has spread up the plant farther than you are seeing, you will be spraying for a long time before you see the disease stopping. Untreated, it will kill the plants.Chlorothalonil is the fungicide to use. It can be found in products like Daconil and Fungonil. Label directions tell you to spray every 7 to 10 days. It has to be repeated after a rain or if you overhead water the plants.

  - Your plants are exhibiting one of the many leaf diseases of tomatoes.  You can visit this page http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/leavesspots.html and narrow it down.  As far as the rot at the bottom of the tomato, that is called Blossom End Rot.  There are a couple main reasons for this.  One is uneven watering, allowing the plant to dry out and then giving it a lot of water, etc.  The other is a lack of calcium in the soil.  Calcium will help deter this problem.  There are some tomato fertilizers with calcium.  You will have to read the labels to find the right one.  Not all tomato fertilizers contain calcium.

  - Consider it a learning experience. Many people provide additional support by driving long stakes or pipes into the ground adjacent to the tomato cage and tying the upper growth to the stakes. A tripod arrangement in the shape of a 'teepee' may provide the required support. You can also prune tomato plants. Select those suckers or stems that have no flowers and remove them. This can also improve air circulation and help to avoid fungal disease. On the other hand, the vines may survive the trauma of growing over the edge.I hope you have you a bumper crop.LS

  - This is a tomato fungal disease called Septoria Leaf Spot. The disease begins on the lower leaves with small brown spots and some enlarge to have gray or tan centers. The spots get a yellow halo, the leaf turns yellow, then brown, The brown leaf gets crispy and falls off. The broken down leaf with the fungus in the soil is one of the ways tomato plants get Septoria next year.The only way to prevent Septoria is to begin spraying before the plant shows any symptoms. If the client begins spraying now, it is difficult to know how much of the plant can be protected. More leaves than the ones with current spots have the fungus developing inside. So he will spray for several weeks and may not see the disease stopping. But if he does not spray, the plants die and there is a greatly diminished crop or no crop.Chlorothalonil is the fungicide needed and it can be found in Daconil or Fungonil. Follow label directions but it is usually sprayingon a 7-10 day repeat until harvest is done. If it rains or the plants are overhead irrigated, the plants need to be resprayed immediately. Chlorothalonil is water soluble.Use a pressurized sprayer that has never been used with weed killers. Do not use a hose-end applicator. Spray the bottoms of leaves as well as the top to the point of run-off. Do not leave unused spray in the sprayer. Mix fresh each time.Next year, begin spraying chlorothalonil on tomatoes to protect them before any symptoms appear. That is at the end of June.Septoria will be back next year... guaranteed. It does not matter if you move the garden to another locationor put plants in pots. Septoria can live on a number of plants outside of the garden.

  - Tall is a relative term. I presume your tomato is an indeterminate type, not a determinate type. Size is dependant upon genentics, but is also affected by things like shade, lots of water, and excessive nitrogen. When your tomatoes come up out of their cages of beyond your stakes, it is OK to prune them back a little. That will encourage blooms on some of the side shoots. It is almost always the case, however that tomatoes need supportabove the top of a 6' stake and over the top of even that tallest tomato cages. If you bought short cages (2 heights are common) you can drive a tall stake through the edge of them to give you some extra top support and to keep them from tipping over in a strong wind.

## 38327_Colorado

  - Hello,You have blossom end rot, which is caused by a calcium deficiency, stemmed (usually) from inconsistent/uneven irrigation. When the flower of the tomato begins to form the fruit, it requires calcium. Water must be available to move the calcium in order to complete the fruit process.The tomatoes will still be edible as the green starts to ripen (cut off the black sunken areas), but obviously you lose quite a bit of the fruit.I would recommend you adjust your irrigation practices. If you can, consider putting the tomatoes on drip irrigation or water consistently each day. Keep the soil evenly moist and consider adding a layer of mulch to help prevent evaporation from the soil surface. Also, do not over-fertilize, as high nitrogen fertilizers can inhibit the uptake of calcium.Generally, this tends to be a problem on the first set of fruit, and the plant can adjust as the season progresses.

  - Thank you for using eXtension to help answer your questions.A good medium for a raised bed is a mixture of about 50% good screened compost and about 50% good quality topsoil. If you can purchase these in bulk, it will be the most cost efficient option for you. A cubic yard is 27 cu feet and you will need just under that amount (24 cu feet full bed). I would recommend filling the bed full because the soil will settle and compact over time with rainfall and gravity. You can leave some room at the top if you want for the mulch. So, if you have the ability, you can buy 1/2 yard each topsoil and compost, mix together and put into the bed. Crown the bed a little in the middle so that excess rainfall runs off the sides. Expect to pay @ $40 to $60 for the bed's soil going this route. A more expensive option will be to purchase 'garden soil' premixed in bags at a big box retailer. You can purchase garden soil in 1 to 2 cu foot bags. Expect to pay @ $3-4 per cu foot or more this route or @ $60 to $100 for the bed.Please feel free to email me or call if you have follow up questions.

  - Go online and look carefully at Early Blight, Late Blight and Septoria Leaf Spot. I can see no resemblance to any of the three leaf diseases tomatoes get in Michigan. The only thing I see in your pictures are a couple of leaves that are touching the soil or covered with soil. Touching a damp surface can cause little leaves at the bottom of the plant to look bad.I do not know if you followed the label directions on the fungicide that you used. This is going to make the difference. You have to spray both the tops and the bottoms of the leaves to keep fungal diseases out. And this also means that you follow their repeat schedule and repeat immediately after it rains or the plants get wet in any way.

  - It is very possible your plant has one of the wilt diseases, Verticillium or Fusarium. I suggest you bring one of the wilted ( but not dead or dry) side branches to the Jefferson County Plant Diagnostic Clinic, located at the Jefferson County fairgrounds. One of the clinicians can examine it for you.  Phone number is 303-271-6620. Office hours are 8am to 5 pm, M-F.  I cannot tell for sure if it is either of these diseases from the pictures, but it looks suspicious. Unfortunately, heirloom tomatoes are susceptible to these diseases. The rain we've had can contribute to the development of these soil borne diseases. If you cannot make it to the office during those hours, you can check to see if you find brown streaks within the wilted stem, by cutting longitudinally into the stem. If you find this type of discoloration, it's a good bet that's what is happening.  If so, you will need to pull the plant out. Good Luck!

  - Tomatoes are pretty resilient plants so transplanting should be doable. Choose a new pot that is 3-4 inches greater in diameter than the current pot. If you can find one deeper too that is a bonus: with tomato plants you can replant them much more deeply each time you transplant, covering the lower stem, so additional new roots will sprout in the newly covered length. Use high quality potting mix, and it would be a good idea to fertilizer the plant with a soluable fertilizer high in phosphorus (the middle number in a formula) to help stimulate new roots and ease transplant shock. Since the plant is fruiting, I presume it is fairly large. So the biggest challenge will be avoiding breaking the plant while you take it out of its pot and get it into the new one. Someone to help hold the top plant steady while you lift and move it might help avoid breaking or damaging the stems etc. If you find the plant is very rootbound (the rootball is packed with roots when you take it out of the pot) you may want to loosen some of them so they may more easily grow into the new potting soil. Once you have it transplanted, make sure you water it well, and you might keep it out of really hot sun for a day or two in order help it recover. It is possible it may shed some blossoms or fruit as a result of the shock; don't panic: that should only be temporary, if it happens at all. Good luck!

  - I could not read the recipe proportions that you provided but my answer is still the same.  Your recipe contains no added acidity which is a huge issue in safety of a home canned tomato product. I would suggest using the recipe you found as a refrigerated product.  If you desire a home canned chutney, we only recommend recipes tested for safety.  Go to   http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/chutney.htmlfor a selection of tested chutney recipes. You may substitute hot peppers in place of some of the bell peppers as long as the overall ratio of low acid ingredients does not change. Here is some additional information from the NCHFP site.    What problems could arise from improper preparation and processing of chutney?	If the cooking and canning steps are improperly carried out, spoilage microorganisms could grow, leading to product loss. 	In a worst-case scenario, specifically if the product is not acidified sufficiently (below pH 4.6), and not heat-processed 	adequately, pathogenic bacterial spores may survive, germinate and form toxin on room temperature storage  such as spores of 	the potentially fatal Clostridium botulinum. Also, if air is not excluded, physical and chemically-induced quality deterioration 	of the product may occur.   Hope this helps. Thanks for using eXtension.

  - Tomatoes can wilt due to lack of moisture, too much moisture, are they located within the vicinity of a black walnut tree, and possible wilt and foliar diseases. You will have to identify what you are dealing with. Wilt diseases in general, cause healthy green leaves and stems to go limp. Fusarium wilt on tomatoes is most common in MD. Foliar diseases are often mistaken for wilt diseases simply because they cause defoliation and the plants end up looking wilted. Make sure your plants are not infected with one or more leaf spot diseases. These include early blight, Septoria, and gray leaf spot. All produce spots or lesions on leaves, start at the bottom of the plant and progress through the season if conditions are right, to defoliate tomato plants (spotting, yellowing, dying.)

  - Thank you for the question. Tomatoes will fail to blossom or experience blossom drop when daytime temperatures are above 85 degrees F AND/OR nighttime temperatures are above 75 degrees F. Blossoms will also drop when night temperatures drop below 55 degrees F. Some varieties are fussier than others when it comes to these temperatures.  Water stress, lack of sunshine and pollination can also contribute to blossoms falling off.

  - Hello Bill, Its difficult to pin point the specific reason for your lack of fruit on the Brandywine. If all the plants are treated equally with watering schedule, container size, sun light etc..., I would first look at the fertilizer schedule and amount applied.Being an indeterminate variety, Brandwine if fed heavily, will remain vegetative for a longer period of time than other determinate varieties. In fact, excess nitrogen may push green leafy growth well beyond the normal 90-100 day maturity date for Brandywine. My suggestion is to remain patient... if the flowers are present, the tomatoes will come. It is only during periods of hot weather, 93 degrees or better, that the blooming response is reduced and tomato production impacted. If blooms are still setting, you should be in good shape.Happy Gardening,JON

  - There is no tomato disease of physiological problem that causes branches of the tomato to split away from the main stem. Your photo does not show this.What is visible in the photo is brown spots on the lower leaves, yellowing leaves that are turning brown and drying up. Some appear to have fallen off. My thought is that this appears to be Septoria Leaf Spot. It has already spread into leaves above its current location so if you begin spraying with a preventative fungicide, it may several weeks before the disease is arrested.Fungicides are preventative, not curative. A fungicide cannot get the fungus out of a leaf it has invaded. There is a period of time when the disease is in the leaf and has not manifested itself. This is going to require you to use a fungicide to protect the parts of the plant that have not got Septoria. I amguessing that whatever webinar you watched talked about fungicide choices and how to apply your choice.I am also seeing a very big tomato plant in what appears to be a very small container. As an indeterminate tomato continues to grow taller, the root system spreads wider. When roots grow to the side of the pot and have no room to spread, they either grow around in a circle or grow down inside the pot where there is less air. In both cases, rootsdo not have normal respiration and have more difficulty picking up more nutrientsbecause of all the roots crowding each other.

  - Yellowing leaves at the bottom of a tomato plant may simply mean they are shaded by the rest of the plant and not getting sun. You should water tomatoes that are in containers until some water runs out of the bottom of your planter. If your planter does not have holes in the bottom, you should place some drain holes in it. If the remainder of the tomato leaves start to yellow, it may mean they don't have enough nutrients. Tomatoes require nitrogen for healthy green leaves, but they also require potassium and phosphorus to set the blooms and create fruit.

  - Hello and thanks for using the Ask an Expert System.  It is difficult to say what may be the cause of your small peppers. There are different many varieties of peppers available. The first thing to check would to make sure that the plants you are growing are a large fruit size variety. Peppers tend to produce larger fruits on plants with fewer peppers. If you have a lot of small peppers, you could try sacrificing some of the smaller fruit.    Peppers and tomatoes are heavy feeders so it would be wise to have your soil tested for fertility. Both of these garden vegetables require full sun and even moisture. Mulching may be necessary to keep the soil evenly moist.

  - Yellow leaves without wilting,or obvious presence of insects may indicate a nitrogen deficiency. This may be caused by overwatering, which would not be an atypical situation in our cool wet spring and early summer, or it could be that your non-mature compost is leaching nitrogen from the soil as it matures.  You may wish to take some symptomatic leaves to your local extension office to rule out other evidence of pests and disease.  A soils test may identify nitrogen levels.

  - Tomato leaves dying from bottom up ---  Hello, --- It sounds like you have Septoria leaf spot, a very common problem. ---  It is a good idea to move your tomatoes and their relatives (potato, eggplants,peppers) and not replant these in the same part  of the garden on a three year rotation. Other thinngs to do are-- Water from below to keep foliage dry. If you must overhead water, do so early enough in the day so that leaves dry before nightfall. Keep foliage from touching soil by pruning. Space plants for good air circulation. Mulch around plants not only keeps a more even supply of moisture, but helps to keep rain from spalshing soil up onto plants. If only growing a few plants, try growing in large containers( 18 inch to half barrel sized per plant). Cleanup all plant debris at the end of each season and do not compost it if it is diseased. Keep any diseased plant material clipped off and removed from the garden during the growing season. The most effective way to prevent any fungal disease is to spray fungicide on upper and lower parts of leaves from the time tiny fruits form throughout the growing season. Only work on the plants when they are dry; keep your pruners and other tools clean by dipping in a 1:10 solution of bleach to water.  Dip pruners between each cut ---  Here is a link that describes the 4 most common fungal diseases of tomato and how to treat them. --- http://migarden.msu.edu/uploads/files/E3170_-_Tomato_Diseases_in_the_Home_Garden.pdf --- You are not alone- we are all dealing with these issues!

  - It sounds as if your tomatoes have blossom end rot (BER).  Its a calcium deficiency but only because of uneven soil moisture. When the soil or potting mix dries, the calcium isnt transported to the bottom of the fruits.       BER is most common early in the season, when the root system is still on the small side.  Its also rather common with container-grown plants; here, the roots have a limited area from which to absorb water. The third instance is with certain paste tomatoes. BER has been a common complaint during this year's unprecedented heat wave.  Soil (or potting mix) is drying out much more rapidly than gardeners expect.     The remedy is making certain the plants have an even supply of moisture at their root tips.  Not soggy, but evenly moist. No need for special mixtures in the planting hole.

  - Without seeing your tomato, it sounds as if you have blossom end rot. This is caused by uneven watering....excessive watering following a dry spell. The stressed roots cannot absorb sufficient calcium for strong cell walls in the fruit. Tomaotes do not like over head watering....they prefer watering the roots from the ground down. To prevent this from happening next year, plant your tomatoes deeply...mulch heavily and water from the ground down. Try to keep watering evenly. You can also purchase a product to help prevent blossom end rot....look for a product that puts calcium into the soil. It is easily found in thelocal box stores or local hardware stores.

  - Hello,  The control of most plant diseases, including anthracnose on tomato, is best accomplished by"starting clean and staying clean", with clean healthy plants and good sanitation practices in the garden. It is much easier to avoid disease than to control it. Fungicide sprays are mostly preventative on the foliage. Foliage disease can go from leaves to fruit.  I would recommend trimming off any foliage with severe spotting. This will also open up the plant canopy for better air circulation. You can use a garden fungicide spray or dust, found in your local garden center or store. Always check the label to be sure you can use a product on certain plants and apply according to the label. A product containing chlorothalonil will be effective against many diseases of tomato. A fungicide spray will not cure existing infections, it will merely protect new foliage and fruit. This is why removal of affected foliage and fruit will be helpful in management.  Try to avoid overhead water on the plants.   Thank you for contacting Delaware Cooperative Extension, Nancy

A tomato will continue to ripen OFF the vine, but it MUST already be in (at least) the pink stage - a picked green tomato will never ripen.

  - Dear gardener,There are a number of things that might have happened, but it would be difficult to diagnose even if we saw photos. If it occurred shortly after a hard rain, I would suspect a fungal problem which could "blossom" with the extra moisture.If only some of the leaves are affected, you may try removing them (and destroy rather than compost them.) If it is the entire plant, you might want to remove it and destroy to avoid affecting any healthy plants. Mulch, such as stray or shredded wood should always be placed on garden soil, keeping it a couple inches away from the plant stems. This will help prevent rain splash from infecting the leaves with pathogens. Also, be sure your plants are staked so that none of the foliage every touches the ground.

## 39857_Oregon

  - Hello and thank you for using ask an expert. It is Blossom End Rot, a calcium deficiency that is causing the issue with your tomatoes. A soil test can determine if it is a soil issue. Since calcium availability can be affected by very acidic soil be sure to ask for a pH test in addition to information on soil mineral content. Calcium deficiency can also be caused by uneven watering. If water is not readily available for carrying the calcium to the plant EVENLY it can result in a localized deficiency in the fruit as it grows and blossom end rot is the result. Our unusually hot weather this year makes it harder to achieve the ideal amounts of water being available in our garden soils at all times. Tomatoes need to be kept evenly moist. You did not mention fertilization of your crop, an application of too much nitrogen can exacerbate the problem as it causes the plant to grow rapidly making it harder to keep that calcium getting to where it is needed. This condition can also occur on other nightshade family crops such as peppers and eggplants if you are growing these plants check fruit development on them. Below summarizes the steps you should take:           Get a soil test to determine if calcium needs to be added. Add lime, preferably in the fall. Mix in the lime thoroughly into the top 8-12 inches of soil. Try to achieve a pH of 6.8 to 7.           Fertilize plants moderately. Plants should be vigorous and green but not luxuriant. Side dress with nitrogen only if required to maintain color and moderate growth.          Water plants deeply every few days not a little every day. Consider mulching plants to aid with keeping soils evenlymoist in hot weather. Provide even moisture throughout fruiting by controlled watering and mulching. Happy gardening!

  - Stink bugs are notoriously difficult insects to control. A nonchemical method to control stink bugs is to pick them off the plants or shake them off into a container of soapy water. There are a few products on the market that can be sprayed on tomatoes that will provide some short term control, but more than one application will be needed during the growing season. On the label of whichever product used, there will a pre-harvest interval listed. This is the length of time that must pass from application to the tomatoes being picked off the plant. These chemicals can be found at a variety of local garden centers and the label will mention if stink bugs are a pest it controls.

It is also more of a problem in certain cultivars. I am not sure if this variety is prone to that or not. The other problem, which may also be contributing to the cracking, is bacterial spot or bacterial speck, seen pretty clearly on the second picture. You should also see dark spots on the leaves of the plants too, surrounded by a yellow halo. Theseare common diseases during wet weather. Unfortunately it is quite difficult to control because it is caused by a bacteria instead of a fungus - fungicides will not work and at this stage of the game it is likely too late to do much anyway. Culturally there are several things you can do in the future. Space plants well apart, stake or cage to allow good air circulation, use mulch to cover soil after plants are established, use drip irrigation or soaker hoses instead of overhead sprinkler irrigation and remove all plant debris at the end of the season.

  - I suspect what you are seeing is result of some excess rain and a calcium deficiency in the soil. This is called blossom end rot.

## 40142_Oregon

  - Hello. My, your photos show some very sad tomatoes. Tomato leaves curl for many reasons. One reason is a watering issue. They can curl because the soil dries out too much in between waterings or because they remain too wet. Another reason that they can curl is the result of being hit with chemical drift from an herbicide. Since the tomatoes you gave to others have the same issues it is highly unlikely that everyone you gave tomatoes tohad herbicide drift also hit their plants. Tomato leaves will also curl as a result of heavy pruning of the plant. With our unusually hot weather watering could be the issue. You did not mention you watering practices. This hot summer requires careful attention to be sure that plants are getting enough water consistently. Tomatoes need evenly moist soil at all times. As to what exactly has caused this problem it is difficult to tell from these photos. I suggest that you take a container or two into your local extension office and allow the Master Gardeners on duty take a look at your plants. The middle photo shows some leaves that could possibly have another issue but it is not possible to tell for sure what that might be. There are also a couple of diseases that cause tomato leaves to curl. The Linn County Extension office is located in Tangent at 33630 McFarland Road. Be sure to call first to ensure that a Master Gardener will be on duty when you get there: 541-967-3871.

## 40232_RhodeIsland
* askextension_tomato/40232_RhodeIsland
  - Hi, You are right that blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency. Sometimes there is not enough calcium in the soil because limestone or woodashhasn't been used in a while but more often than not it is because plants need water to take up calcium and other nutrients and the plants are not receiving consistent water. Trying watering them on a more regular basis when dry and use a mulch to preserve soil moisture.

## 40267_Oregon

  - Your tomatoes have sunburn, sometimes called sun scald, due to the recent heat wave and minimal leaf cover. To reduce further damage, rig temporary shade a foot or so above the plants. Also, be certain to maintain evenly moist growing mix, be that soil or potting mix.

## 40271_Iowa
* askextension_tomato/40271_Iowa
  - Hi, you could choose to freeze them first, it would be a safe choice. However, the tomatoes would be very soft (mushy) if they had been both frozen and then later canned. As long as you did not want the tomatoes to have form/shape after removing them from jars to use, it would be fine. You do not need to process an entire canner load of jars each time you can. It would not be as economically efficient to do partial loads, but it is certainly something that you could do if you chose to.

## 40273_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/40273_Oregon
  - It sounds as if your tomatoes have blossom end rot (BER). Its a calcium deficiency but mainly because of uneven soil moisture. When the soil or potting mix dries, the calcium isnt transported to the bottom of the fruits. The disorder is particularly common this year, most likely because the continuing heat wave. Soil (or potting mix) is drying out much more rapidly than gardeners expect.   BER is most common early in the season, when the root system is still on the small side. Its also rather common with container-grown plants where the roots have a limited area from which to absorb water. The third instance is with certain paste tomatoes.    The remedy is making certain the plants have an even supply of moisture at their root tips. Not soggy, but evenly moist. No need for special mixtures in the planting hole. Calcium sprays dont help either.   See Blossom end rot: http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/16949/fs139.pdf%EF%BB%BF

## 40317_Minnesota

  - It isn't necessary to pull the plants but it isn't advisable to use the affected tomatoes for canning.  Following is an excerpt from a University of Minnesota publication that explains why:"Both bacterial speck and spot can come into the garden on infected seed or transplants. The bacteria are then easily transferred from plant to plant through splashing water, strong winds or on a gardeners hands and tools. The bacteria survive Minnesotas harsh winters in plant debris. Luckily in most cases infection with bacterial speck and spot do not result in significant yield loss. Although the fruit with raised corky bacterial spots would not be considered marketable at the grocery store, smart gardeners know the fruit can still be enjoyed once the superficial spots have been cut away. Infected tomatoes should not be used for canning, however, because the disease may have changed the pH of the fruit.To reduce the spread of the disease, gardeners should avoid working in tomato plants when the leaves are wet. Under moist conditions the bacteria reproduce and easily stick to a gardeners hands and tools. Waiting until plants are dry for chores like staking, pruning and weeding will reduce the spread of the bacteria. In addition, providing good air movement around the plants by staking or caging tomatoes, pulling weeds, and spacing plants far apart will allow leaves to dry quickly. Allow 2 years to pass before planting tomatoes or peppers in the same location. Do not save seed from infected plants."

  - Based on your photos there are several factors that you have to consider.  The tomatoes with black bottoms looks like blossom end rot, a common nutritional disorder. Symptoms are most often seen in paste type or plum tomatoes. This looks like the type of tomato you are growing. Remove the tomatoes that are affected and discard. Regular, deep watering will alleviate the problem if calcium levels in the soil are adequate. See more on blossom end rot http://extension.umd.edu/growit/blossom-end-rot-vegetables   The tomatos in the containerslook leggy and thin and looks like it is stretching for the light. Plants receiving insufficient sunlight become weak and spindly and produce fewer blossoms and fruit. You did not mention how much sun the plant receives. They require a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight and will be more productive in 8-10 hours of sun.  Also, the containers do not look large enough for the plants and you have two tomatoes in one container. They are competing for moisture and nutrients.  A regular size tomato requires a 5 gallon container. A patio type tomato may be planted in a smaller container.

## 40355_SouthDakota

  - You didn't mention if the leaves that are turning yellow start from the bottom of your plant. Tomatoes tend to get blights that often start near the bottom of the plant.  You are wise to water under the plants, make sure they are mulched to prevent spore splash up from rain, and staked to promote good circulation. You can carefully remove the leaves making sure to sanitize you tools and dispose of leaves rather than composting them. Some general guidelines. 1) Water at the base of the plants, and in the morning rather than the evening, to minimize the amount of time that the leaves are wet. 2) Remove as much plant debris as possible in the fall and promptly plow under or bury the remaining residue. 3) Rotate crops so that tomatoes are grown in the same ground only every three or four years. 4) Avoid working with plants when foliage is wet to avoid spreading disease-causing microorganisms. Check the following: Columbines do best in sun or light shade, and they prefer soil that stays somewhat moist, but drains well. Columbines generally begin blooming in early to mid-May and continue through June. Removing flowers as they fade helps prolong the bloom time. This procedure, known as dead-heading, keeps plants looking good and prevents the formation of seed pods. Plants tend to deteriorate over time especially if drainage is poor. Count on 3 years for most plantings. Some need to replace periodically.You might check for insects causing damage.

  - It's unusual for ants to eat tomato fruit. Often they are farming aphids or looking for worms or caterpillars when they are on tomato plants. You should inspect your plants for signs of insect activity to see if that is the attraction.To keep the ants off, try pruning off the bottom most leaves on the plants. Then place a square of cardboard on the ground with a hole cut in the center so it fits around the plant stem. Create a barrier of double sticky tape on the cardboard so the ants have to cross it to get to the plant. You may have to change the cardboard or add more tape to discourage the ants. Eventually, they will find another food source if you persist.

## 40414_Minnesota
* askextension_tomato/40414_Minnesota
  - Thank you for the question. You don't need to throw the plant out to save the others and you can enjoy the tomatoes from this plant by cutting out the spots. You can reduce the spread of disease now by avoiding working on your plants when the leaves are wet, providing good air movement around the plants by staking or caging, pulling weeds, and spacing plants far apart enough to allow the leaves to quickly dry. This fall, clean up and discard all plant residue because the bacteria survive our winters in the plant debris. Next year, plant tomatoes in a different location. Allow 2-3 years before you plant tomatoes back in this same spot. Control of disease is generally most effective when measures start before the disease appears, usually when the plants are 6 inches tall. Your tomato already has the infection so any fungal sprays are likely to be ineffective. It's also a bit late to spray the tomatoes that don't currently show disease. Some strains of bacterial speck are resistant to fungicides and usually several products need to be rotated to be effective. Using several products gets to be logistically difficult because of the length of time one must wait between application of a product and when the fruit is safe for consumption after a thorough wash. This time period will be listed on the product label.

  - Yes, you can process red and orange tomatoes together. Remember to acidify the tomatoes to ensure the pH is low enough for safe canning. 1 Tbsp. bottled lemon juice per pint, 2 Tbsp. per quart. Or twice that much of vinegar in each jar. Call us if you have further questions.

## 40486_Colorado

  - Thank you for your question and picture. Blossom end rotbegins as light tan, water-soaked lesions on the blossom end of the fruit. These lesions enlarge and turn black and leathery. The cause is thought to be a combination of cold temperatures or excessive heat during blossom set, and fluctuations in water supply. When these two factors occur simultaneously, calcium often becomes unavailable to the plant. Hence, a calcium deficiency occurs during fruit formation. To manage the problem, fertilize and water properly. Avoid setting out transplants too early in the season. Use mulch to help reduce fluctuations in moisture levels.

  - It's hard to say with any certainty... are they growing in the same location as previous years? It's a good idea to rotate crops so diseases and pests have less chance of getting hold. I know here in New Brunswick (next door to Maine), the season has been somewhat cool and wet this year. I know my own tomatoes are not best pleased, and are not as vigorous as they usually are. Since you seem to be doing other things right, and don't mention yellowing leaves or other signs of blights, I would put it down to the season. If we get some good warm weather between now and fall, we'll still get a crop.

## 40533_Oregon

  - Cracking is usually caused by uneven watering. A long dry period followed by a heavy irrigation or thunderstorm will often cause tomatoes to crack. Regular watering and mulch will help reduce growth cracks. Make sure the water goes deep. Tomatoes are deep rooters and the problem of cracking ofter occurs when the soil dries out deep and only the soil at the surface is watered. Some varieties are more susceptible to cracking than others eg roma tomatoes are fairly resistant.

## 40685_California

  - It looks as if your tomato plant now has mildew. Tomatoes are very touchy when it comes to watering. They need consistent watering; too much or inconsistent watering can produce blossom end rot. Too little or again inconsistent watering can cause cracking and yellowing. Also the effects of over watering and the effects of under watering often look the same -- yellowing or browning of leaves.Mildew again occurs when watering is inconsistent and you have a stressed plant. It is unsightly but usually not deadly to the plant. My guess is from looking at the pictures you sent and now the mildew that your plant is having some root rot issues from overwatering or too moist a soil. I often think that self watering planters could also be called assisted suicide planters. If you get yourself a hydrometer (it measures the moisture in the soil) for $4.95 or whatever and use it to test your soil moisture you have much greater control over keeping your plants watered just right. Seeing that your question comes from LA county you should have great weather for growing tomatoes although I know you have had above average heat this summer. Don't want to get a hydrometer just stick your finger down as deep as it will go in the soil if the soil is moist don't water, if it is dry water. If you can even out your moisture levels your tomatoes should recover and produce. Once your plants are looking healthy again remember heavy feeders such as tomatoes may need additional fertilizer as the fertilizer in "planting soil" washes away over the summer with watering. DO NOT fertilize while they continue to appear stressed that will be an additional stresser. Good luck

  - Well, you have some sort of right information and some misinformation there. Tomato fungus does not come from the woods, but we do have a serious problem with Early Blight and Late Blight on our tomatoes. Growing tomatoes on the coast is a challenge because it does not get warm enough without the protection, but the Siletz area should be quite a bit warmer. Nights below 50 can be a problem. Siletz was bred in Oregon to withstand more chilling. Days over 86 can cause serious blossom drop, however, on such tomatoes. At the first symptoms of Early blight, removing all yellowing, spotted leaves and spraying with the biological Serenade will usually get you past it. Late blight comes on really fast, although the vigilant gardener can also do better with early sanitation and the spray. Ideally you want to keep all foliage from the stem clipped up at least 12" to maximize drying. Never water so the foliage goes into the night damp or wet.The problem with most of the peach trees is leaf curl. It takes 3-4 correctly timed sprays to keep it down. A better choice is to plant a leaf curl resistant variety. There are several out now. Any curled leaves should be removed and destroyed also. No leaves should be left overwinter on the ground. Some people cover them to keep the foliage dry which prevents the infection.We normally plant garlic from late September to late October. You can garden year round here, however, so it is not all bad news.Welcome to Oregon.

Watering cannot be done on a schedule, unfortunately. As the plants grow, they require more water. Higher temperatures, more sun, and breezes will all cause water loss. The only foolproof way to water is to poke a finger in the soil and water when the soil dries down below about 1". Then soak the soil thoroughly.

Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. Select disease resistant varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease.

  - There are two different types of splitting (cracking) that occur on tomatoes  radial and concentric. Radial cracks go down the sides, while concentric (circles) go around the stems. Both occur when fruits expand rapidly. Usually, rapid intake of water is responsible for the cracks. Once fruits get full sized, the skin and flesh of the fruit lose their elasticity. And when water gets moved into the fruits, they crack. Varieties vary in their susceptibility to cracking. Most heirloom varieties are prone to cracking, while the newer hybrids are more resistant. To reduce cracking, maintain more uniform watering (don't go from wet to dry to wet) and don't over fertilize the crop. Too much fertilizer causes soft growth and those plants produce fruits more prone to cracking.

  - Hi.  It's exciting that tomatoes are coming on strong this year!  You do not need to dip tomatoes in vinegar before drying.  You can skin them (optional), cut them in pieces and place on the drying tray.  Some people like the taste of lemon juice or vinegar with their tomatoes, so dip them for flavor but not safety. The person may be thinking of canning tomatoes.  We add bottled lemon juice or vinegar to the jar of tomatoes to increase the acid so they are safe for water bath canning.  Botulism spores need an anaerobic (no oxygen), moist, low-acid environment (e.g., a jar of food!) to produce the toxin.  Since the drying process removes the moisture from the food, we don't worry about botulism with dried foods.

  - While off-tasting vegetables can be the result of a nutrient imbalance, excessive phosphorus and calcium should not be causal factors. We assume you planted a commonly used cover crop as your over-winter 'ground cover'. Oats, clover, or rye should not cause a flavor variation.Different varieties of tomatoes have different tastes and some are more acidic than others which could account for the 'sour' taste you experienced. There are several other causal factors that can affect the taste of vegetables, and they can be either environmental (weather, sunlight, soil, etc) to cultural (nutrients, irrigation, etc.). Obviously, it's difficult for us to give you an exact cause for the 'sour' taste of your tomatoes, but we encourage you to keep growing them. Perhaps you could try some different varieties next year.LS

  - Yes, many growers do what you have suggested with good results. Unfortunately, tomato plants do sometimes succumb to disease before the end of the growing season so it's not uncommon to harvest fruit from leafless vines.

  - Bacterial Spot or Speck I believe that you have the bacterial spot or speck and I have found nothing that says you cannot eat the fruit if it matures. Cut the spots away and if the inside is good you should be ok. If you use chemicals, do follow the instructions that will tell you when you can consume. See below for management options. Both bacterial spot and speck will target leaf tissue and also hit tomato fruit. This disease is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonasvesicatoria, which attacks green but not red tomatoes. Peppers are also attacked. The disease is more prevalent during wet seasons. Damage to the plants includes leaf and fruit spots, which result in reduced yields, defoliation and sun- scalded fruit. The symptoms consist of numerous small, angular to irregular, water-soaked spots on the leaves and slightly raised to scabby spots on the fruits. The bacteria survive the winter on volunteer tomato plants and on infected plant debris. Moist weather is conducive to disease development. Most outbreaks of the disease can be traced back to heavy rainstorms that occurred in the area. Infection of leaves occurs through natural openings. Infection of fruits must occur through insect punctures or other mechanical injury. Bacterial spot is difficult to control once it appears in the field. Any water movement from one leaf or plant to another, such as splashing rain drops, overhead irrigation, and touching or handling wet plants, may spread the bacteria from diseased to healthy plants. Prevention &amp; Treatment:Only use certified disease-free seed and plants. Avoid areas that were planted with peppers or tomatoes during the previous year. Avoid overhead watering by using drip or furrow irrigation. Remove all diseased plant material. Prune plants to promote air circulation. Spraying with a copper fungicide will give fairly good control the bacterial disease. Follow the instructions on the label. See Table 1 for fungicide products for home garden use.

  - It is normal for the bottom leaves to yellow and drop as the plant ages.  Tomatoes can be susceptible to several foliar diseaseswhich cancauseleafspots,browning,defoliation, etc.Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. Remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage, they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - I am going to assume your problem is caused by a virus and not something else. First, you need to know which virus is causing the problem (100's attack tomatoes and each are different in how they were transmitted). You can send plant samples to the Texas Plant Disease Diagnostic Lab in College Station to see which virus is the problem and there is a fee. Download paperwork from their website and send. If you do not plan to do this and want something general then you need to find a tomato that has virus resistance to some of the 100's of viruses and that may help. There are no chemicals to spray for viruses other than if aphid, whitefly or psyllid transmitted then insecticides to reduce those insects that transmit those type of viruses.

## 41836_Pennsylvania
* askextension_tomato/41836_Pennsylvania
  - Blossom end rot on tomatoes is a common problem and often thought of as a disease. The symptoms of this problem look like a leathery black end  on the tomato.  The tops of the  fruit often look ripe and delicious.  This problem is not a disease, virus, or insect problem, but rather a  nutritional issue.  Calcium is a nutrient provided by the soil. Calcium  helps the cell walls in the fruit to form.  It moves through the plant  by water.  In the soil, it becomes even less accessible to the plant if  the soil pH is too low. The ideal pH range for tomatoes is 6.2-6.8. When the plant is young, it uses less  calcium.  As the fruit begins to grow, more calcium is needed for the  fruit to develop into a ripe tomato.  Since the calcium is moved by  water, and the fruit of a tomato becomes mature during  the heat of the summer, more water is needed to allow more calcium to be  available to the fruit.  Hence, if you are not watering regularly  during drier times, blossom end rot occurs.  Watering regularly during time of fruit  development - approximately one inch per week - and adding calcitic lime  to the soil if the pH is low will help insure a healthy tomato.  If the problem occurs, your best solution is to pick the fruit  that is affected and begin watering regularly.

  - Hello,I need a little clarification about your question:Are you wanting to know how to propagate potatoes next spring? If so, then you can click here to view the process of how to using certified seed potatoes for propagation next spring (See page 4). It is actually recommended to avoid using home-grown potatoes for planting, since they may be heavily infected with viruses that can reduce yield and quality of the new crop. Or is your question concerning small, tomato-like fruit on the top of your potato plants? This is the actual fruit of the potato plant. Normally, we don't notice them because the flowers typically fall off the plants and never have the opportunity to go from flower to fruit. If you saved the ripe seeds inside the potato fruit, you would not get  the same kind of potatoes as the parent plant. It would take several  years to even grow these to a size that you could harvest. The only  people saving and planting potato seeds are growers and breeders who are  hoping to produce a new variety of potato. Furthermore, these potato fruit are not edible. More precisely, they are poisonous.  They contain high amounts of solanine that can make the eater very ill. View this Michigan State U. Extension publication for more information. I hope this answers your question.

  - The problem could still be the variety. If you purchase your plants from a local grower rather than a box store, you will be able to find out from the grower what varieties perform well in your areaThe other factors that influence tomatoes are environmental. Tomatoes need lots of sun, adequate water but not too much, and nutrient rich soil. Once they begin to fruit, they may need fertilizer as well. I recommend reading Growing Tomatoes in the Home Garden for a start. Then you can get your soil tested by purchasing a soil test kit from your local Penn State Extension.

Here are several publications on tomato diseases: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/#tomatoesBecause the fruit isn't affected, it sounds like you have verticillium wilt. Go ahead and read the descriptions and look at the photos. There's nothing to do about resolving the issue at this point in the growing season. However, for future crops, you'll see that recommendations for all these issues involve planting resistant varieties (if available), and rotating crops remembering that peppers, potatoes and eggplants are in the same family as tomatoes (nightshade) and can also be susceptible. Watering at the base of the plants (vs. overhead sprinklers) and mulching the plants will lessen the pathogens from splashing onto the leaves of the plants. Finally, good sanitation is important - cleaning up the planting beds and disposing of dead plant materials - will reduce overwintering areas for the pathogens.

  - Im sorry to hear about your continuing problems with blossom end rot (BER) in your tomatoes. Unfortunately your preference for growing San Marzano tomatoes, one of the more susceptible tomatoes, has set you up for problems. Even though calcium is involved in BER, home remedies such as adding dry milk or egg shells to the planting hole, wont help prevent BER. Even so, you can be successful with San Marzano tomatoes.    Its critical to maintain a continuously available source of moisture for tomato roots so that the calcium can be absorbed and then transported to the end of the fruit. Thats as true for containers filled with potting mix as it is in the garden. Tomatoes in containers will pose a greater challenge than the same kind in the garden because the limited root room dries quite rapidly. (Thats been especially so during the recent prolonged spell of high summer temperatures; sometimes containers needed water once or even twice daily.)

  - Hello, The answer to your question is maybe.  the plant disease will not affect people.  If the tomatoes are still whole, undamaged, and not over-ripe they are safe to use for canning.  The risk is that canned or processed tomatoes need to have sufficient acidity to prevent disease organisms from taking over.  Acidity is reduced as tomatoes age and as they begin to decompose from bacteria introduced into breaks in the skin or other blemishes. Make sure that you are harvesting tomatoes for canning that are good, full, undamaged specimens.

  - You can put a fence around the tomatoes if the area is small.  Covering them is also a consideration.  The fence should have small enough holes the squirrels can't get through the fence.  Poultry netting may be small enough unless you have small squirrels.  Another option is to spray the tomatoes with Capsacin.  Capsacin will make the tomatoes taste bad for the squirrels. It is the "hot" ingredient in hot sauces.  You will wash them before eating them.A third option is to trap the squirrels and relocate them.  Before relocating them contact the Colorado Division of Parks and Wildlife.  They can tell you where to relocate them to.  Below is the URL to the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Offices.

  - If the tomato plants getsmall brown spots on lower leaves and the leaf turns yellow and then brown and finallyfalls off, it is Septoria leaf spot. It is a fungal disease that can be prevented but not cured. All the leaves that fall off are the stuff that starts the disease next year on tomatoes in the area. If you choose not to spray to prevent Septoria in future years, you will have Septoria again and again.The blotchy ripening(that's what it is called)on the fruit is caused by the loss of leaves and fruit getting too much sun. The plant is stressed and the excess sun causes it to happen. Keeping healthy leaves on the plant can prevent this.

As to the jars that seemed to seal before processing, they should be processed in the pressure canner too.

  - Thank you for the question. I sympathize with you as this has been my experience with plum or paste type tomatoes this year as well. The problem might be internal blossom end rot or side wall blossom end rot. Plum tomatoes are more susceptible to this condition than other varieties.  This condition isn't caused by insect or disease, but is thought to be caused by a lack of calcium uptake by the plant. This most often is due to irregular watering practices. It is recommended that tomatoes get 1 inch of supplemental water per week if there isn't enough rain. Here are several resources for you to learn more: http://www.ct.gov/caes/lib/caes/documents/publications/fact_sheets/plant_pathology_and_ecology/blossom-end_rot_of_tomato_11-04-10_r.pdf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0YBQUZZ-zfM Good University research based video about the condition and how to minimize its appearance.

  - Sounds like your tomatoes have Blossom End Rot (BER, photos below). When tomato fruits are growing and expanding in diameter, lots of Calcium (Ca) is needed for cell walls. If the plant does not take up enough Ca during that time, cell walls collapse, leaving the bottom half to quarter of the fruit rotted and brown.Our area soils have high to excessive amounts of Ca, but plants can only take up that Ca when it is dissolved in water.   So, keeping the soil uniformly moist will help prevent BER.

Just freeze them whole, then when you are ready to use them, run warm water over them and the skins should slip off.

  - Growth cracks result from extremely rapid fruit growth. Small cracks just leave a scar while large cracks are open and can invite insects &amp; disease. This may be brought on by periods of abundant rain and high temperatures, or can occur when water is suddenly available to the plant through rain or irrigation after a period of drought. Cracks may radiate from the stem end of the fruit or may encircle the fruit. Cracks are often invaded by secondary fungi and bacteria that further rot the fruit.  Maintaining even moisture by watering regularly and mulching the soil around the tomato plant can help reduce growth cracks. Varieties differ in susceptibility to cracking, and variety descriptions may be helpful in choosing a plant less likely to crack.

  - Hello.  I fear weather is catching up with you for this year although you could try protecting your plants with row cloth at night as the temperatures continue to cool. Be sure to take it off during the warm days. With large plants it will not be easy to do. I doubt you have enough warm days left for current blossoms to develop and produce ripe fruit. You may be better off if you pruning off the blossoms and allowing your plants to concentrate the energy they have left to ripen the fruit already on the vine. Fertilizer at this point would encourage new growth and would make for a bushier plant but not increase your yield at this point.    You mentioned that you seeded your tomatoes in June directly into raised beds. Next year give yourself a longer and earlier productive season by starting your tomatoes indoors six to eight weeks before the last frost. The San Marzano Gigante seed packet says that it takes 90 days to produce. By planting in June that means they start to produce in August or September given favorable weather. If you can plant well developed starts grown inside into your raised beds in late May or early June you have a big head start on the season. You can also help the plants develop faster by taking measures to protect them from cool weather when they go into the ground. There are products available such as the wall of water that help retain heat and protect from a late frost. You can also protect them with a cloche made of hoops and plastic or row cloth to keep them warm in the cool spring weather. When the weather warms we are still plagued with cool nights that can stall heat loving tomatoes. Keep the soil warm with black plastic or some kind of organic mulch. This will also help you keep the soil moisture from evaporating. If you use plastic be sure to put drip irrigation under it. Anything that helps keep the soil warm will help your tomatoes all summer long. Happy gardening.

  - It would not be adequate for destroying potential food spoilage or food borne illness causing pathogens in tomatoes or tomato products.  It takes a long period of time at a lethal temperature to destroy any potential pathogens, so just heating the contents to a simmer and then letting them cool would be inadequate. Current tomato processing instructions call for both acidification and heat processing to ensure safety.  These recent recommendations are based on a history of spoilage and food borne illness from tomato products preserved using older recipes and recommendations.  They do seem long, but repeated testing has determined that the longer processing times are necessary. We have a new publication with complete tomato canning instructions you can download. https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/files/project/pdf/...Also, remember the toll-free Food Safety and Preservation hotline is open Monday- Friday 9 am - 4 pm  1-800-354-7319

  - This is anthracnose, a fungal disease that affects the tomato fruit. The fungus actually attacks green tomatoes but the anthracnose only becomes apparent after the fruit ripens. A fungicide now will not control anthracnose this season. Instead, plan to rotate where you plant tomatoes next year as the fungal population builds up in the soil when tomatoes are grown in the same place year after year. Remove all the spent foliage this fall. Next year, you can begin a regular fungicide program which covers the developing fruit.

  - Dear Gardener,  Thank you for contacting Bonnie Plants. I'm sorry. Those are so misshapen I can't determine what variety it is. This appears to be from improper (incomplete) pollination.

  - Good Afternoon,Thank you for your question. Indeed, there are lots of great tomatoes available right now. It's important to follow instructions in tested recipes to ensure safety. We do not have any tested recipes that include the skins. Skins change the density of the product, so the processing time we have available would be inaccurate. Also, tested recipes for making juice include simmering the tomato product first before juicing (hot pack). The heating of the tomatoes is an important part of the processing as well, so must be included for safety and accurate processing time. If you would like to include the skins and seeds in your tomato juice, you may freeze it or use it fresh. Thanks again for your important question.The ins

  - This does not sound like a fungal or disease problem since the plants are producing tomatoes and also showing new growth. Since you are noticing these symptoms soon after planting I am thinking you may have some transplant issues.  Make sure the young plants are acclimated to outdoor life by gradually introducing them to full sunshine, do not plant them too soon when the soil is not warm enough and make sure they have adequate water as they settle in to their new home. Also follow your soil test recommendations for nitrogen applications.  Hope this helps! Please write back if you have further questions and you can also include photos of your plants.

  - Hello and thank you for using ask an expert.  I dont think that you would gain anything from potting up your tomatoes and putting them in your greenhouse. It is the end of the season and as long as we dont have a heavyfrost the tomatoes on your vines currently will continue to develop and ripen. Digging them up and potting could cause shock and might actually be counterproductive. What may be helpful is to cover them with a heavier row cover at night to try and prevent the cooler nights from setting them back and possibly slowing ripening of fruit already on the vine. When it is going to get warm during the day you should remove the cloth and put it back on at night. You should reduce watering tomatoes at this time of the year to encourage ripening of what is on the vine now and prune off any blossoms that are on the vines as they divert energy of the plant away from the ripening fruit. When a freeze is expected, harvest all your fruit and bring it inside. The ones that are far enough along will continue to ripen on your kitchen counter.

  - Thank you for contacting the Cherokee Co. UGA Extension Office and Master Gardeners concerning damage to your tomatoes. The problem you have described is most often associated withthe damage from stink bugs or leaf-footed bugs. These are piercing or sucking insects that penetrate the skin of the tomato to feed. The damage is normally on the top of the plant where the insects land. There are several insecticides that will help control them. I have included a link to an excellent UGA publication on tomatoes. While this is a publication focused on commercial tomato growing, it has excellent info on raising tomatoes and identifying problems.

  - 2015 was a bad year for tomatoes for everyone in the Midwest.  It didn't seem to matter what variety one grew.  Most gardeners and even tomato farmers had nothing but complaints about this year's crop.  I'm sure this was because of the saturated soils from the spring rainstorms, followed by hot and dry weather. Trying to choose a tomato variety is nearly a full time job.  I would suggest that you examine the following links and see if you can find something you like here.  Then, contact your local greenhouses and garden centers later this winter and see if they will carry any of these.  If not, you will need to start them from seed either straight into the garden, or grow your own transplants. https://extension.illinois.edu/veggies/tomato.cfm http://web.extension.illinois.edu/vegguide/grow_tomato.cfm http://web.extension.illinois.edu/cfiv/homeowners/030426.html Good luck next year!

  - If the vines are still alive and we continue to have warm days they should ripen. You might cover them at night to keep them warmer. The ones that are turning a little and have no blemished can be picked and ripened in doors. One of the big problems with some of the juicier tomatoes is that they split when it rains and then they spoil fast. Might want to pick some that are in good shape and leave some to vine ripen.   One caution is that if you want to can them be sure you pick them before the vines die. Tomatoes from dead and frost killed vines are not safe to can.   Thanks for using Ask an Expert  Nellie

  - There are two possibilities for blackened seeds:The fruit is over-ripe at the time of processing (just seeds are darkened)or-If the seeds and the interior wall are blackened, the tomato had some minor damage and a fungal problem like Anthracnose got in. This could greatly affect the flavor of the tomato.So it's just darkened seeds vs. darkened seeds and interior tomato wall. I cannot tell by the photo which it is. Darkened seeds will not affect the quality but darkened seeds and interior will very much affect the quality.

The fruit symptoms you describe could be due to a herbicide influence, but then the plants would also show symptoms such as stunting and curled leaves. The separation you see in the fruit could be due to cool temperatures at bloom. There may also be a genetic factor involved. Does it happen only on certain varieties? The green on the inside is also due to weather conditions.If it is any help, it has been a difficult year to grow tomatoes in Michigan.Ron

  - Tomato leaves will often curl if they're under stress. A number of different factors could be at play here:-Pest issue. Did you see any aphids or other sap sucking insects? Sap sucking insects can often cause leaf distortion and yellowing either by the sap sucking itself or by transmitting viruses.-Nutrient deficiency. Tomato leaves turn purple often when there is a nutrient deficiency (such as phosphorus). This can be a pH issue (which interferes with the uptake of nutrients) or inadequate fertilization.-Viral. There are a few viruses that can cause similar symptoms to the ones you have listed. The only way to be sure is to have a plant tested.It's hard to say with certainty what the problem is without a thorough examination, but my main suspicions are that this is a nutrient issue. Regardless, it's not a great idea to reuse the same soil for the same crop year after year as pathogen inoculum can build up. If you'd like to save the soil, make sure your compost is hot.Good luck!

  - Your photo is out of focus. We cannot say for sure what you may be dealing with. However, it is possible that the brown areas may be due to late season issues such as uneven ripening. Cool temperatures in late summer and early fall combined with diminishing daylight may prevent fruits from ripening fully. This is often observed in tomato and pepper crops. Cool weather will also cause blotchiness and odd colored patterns on fruits. See more on our website http://extension.umd.edu/growit/uneven-ripening-vegetables                 mhmh

  - The picture you included is normal for tomatoes especially depending on the method of pack. Raw pack tomatoes will often "float" or separate due to the loss of oxygen during processing resulting in what you see. They are safe to eat as this is due to packing or product shrink. The safety is a question of did you use a recipe from an approved trusted source, were they processed properly, is the jar sealed based on the push button test or spoon test. For the spoon test, use a metal spoon and strike the lid of the jar, if you hear a clear ring the jar is sealed and if you hear a "thud" the jar is not sealed.

  - Thank you for your question. Before frost hits and plants go down, pick and bring fruit indoors to ripen. Extended exposure to cool temperatures interferes with ripening and flavor development. Clip fruit to leave a very short stem piece but not so long to punch holes in other tomatoes. Stems ripped out of fruit will open them to decay. Store ripening tomatoes at 55 to 70 degrees F. Refrigerator temperatures of 40 degrees are too cold to ripen mature green tomatoes and are colder than desired for ripe ones. Ripening enzymes are destroyed by cold temperatures whether in the garden or in a refrigerator. Ripen tomatoes in well-ventilated, open cardboard boxes at room temperature checking them every few days to eliminate those that may have spoiled. Mature green tomatoes will ripen in 14 days at 70 degrees F.

  - That does not look good. In fact, it looks like that could very well be late blight which would be lethal. In addition, looking at the veins in the leaves, the tomatoes may also be suffering from a nutrient deficiency. However, that could very well be a result of the disease as well.Whatever it is, it looks like a fungal disease to me. If you want to try to save the tomato plants, cut off diseased foliage, spray with a fungicide that is labeled for tomatoes and try to keep the leaves as dry as possible (i.e. no overhead watering!!!). If it is indeed late blight, none if this might work.

  - Why do you need to pick them at such a precise size? Tomatoes within any variety will vary in size depending on conditions, point in the season, etc. Tomatoes will ripen if set in moderate temperatures (not cold) in a semi-closed container that "breathes." For home gardeners a paper bag set on your kitchen counter works well. However, fruit ripened this way will not taste as good as those allowed to ripen on the vine because the chemical changes that convert starches to sugars that take place in natural ripening do not happen once they are picked.

  - Hi Kelly,I'm not surprised that you are getting conflicting answers from folks - Yellow Shouldering is a baffling condition that has even the experts experimenting with solutions.It can be caused, if not simply exacerbated by uneven temperatures. The heat, and perhaps un-even watering messes with the physiology of the plant. This can cause the potassium levels in the fruit to drop. If your soil is too low in potassium (K) this can make the situation worse. Do not simply add K however. An excess of this mineral will cause other problems.A soil test is the place to begin. Here is how you can do this:http://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/And here is some university based research on Yellow Shoulder syndrome:http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/Portals/0/Gardening/Gardening%20Help/Visual%20Guides/Tomato%2...https://agdev.anr.udel.edu/weeklycropupdate/?p=3457Ihopethis ishelpful PleasecontactAaE again ifyou havefurtherquestions.

  - Thank you for your question.Purchasing hybrid seeds is fine. If you really like Burpee Fourth of July tomatoes, you should continue to grow them. However, saving seed from hybrid varieties is not advised since offspring will produce quite different vegetables. Hybrid seeds are created by crossing two parent plants to achieve the superior qualities of each parent. Hybrids have been created to improve disease resistance, increase yield, uniformity, marketability, timing of harvest, and vigor. First generation hybrids grow and produce more vigorously. This means that seeds saved from hybrid plants may not produce the same in subsequent years as the first generation harvest. According to the USDA, the production of heritable improvements in plants via either genetic engineering or other more traditional methods constitutes a genetically modified organism (GMO). This includes hybrids.

  - Hello,Thank you for reaching out to Extension with your question regarding your tomatoes. Tomatoes can suffer from a variety of diseases such as wilt, blight, septoria leaf spot, nutritional deficiencies, etc that may cause them to die just as they are setting fruit. Can you describe the symptoms of your plants in more detail? See this factsheet for help in distinguishing symptoms: https://extension.umd.edu/sites/default/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM%20Tomato...Did the plant seem to be dying from the bottom up or the top down? Did you notice spots on the leaves or did you see streaks on the stems? Did the plants die rapidly (one to tow days) or did you notice a gradual decline? Did the fruit have spots as well?If your plants were suffering from early blight or septoria leaf spot (both very common in this area), some cultural practices that you can use to control this disease are crop rotation, removing all diseased plant material from the premise throughout the season and at the end of the season, selecting disease-resistant varieties of tomatoes to plant, maintaining fertility of plants at optimal times, andwatering in the morning to reduce the risk of fungal growths.

  - Blight is a very frustrating problem for many of us. It can live on in the soil but also can be blown in. Moving the plants to another area will help, but you may still get hit with the fungus. Don'tplant tomatoesorpotatoes intheinfectedboxforthreeyears.Look for tomato varieties that are listed as being blight resistant. VFN resistance is important for other problems (Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, and root-knot nematodes), but it does not cover blight.

  - Your plant looks healthy which is a good sign. Tomato production this time of year can be spotty. Tomatoes require at least 8 hours of sunlight, and with our shorter days, this can affect flower production and fruit set. The other issue can be reduced number of pollinators during this time of year. Many will not be as active due to the cooler weather and shortened day length. Once the plant starts to actively grow again you can begin to fertilize.

  - There are two kinds of tomato blight. Early blight is caused by a fungus, and I'm going to refer you to an answer by our horticulture director, Nancy Knauss. The other disease is late blight. It is caused by a type of water mold, and it rots the fruit and vine. Here is a link to a Cornell University fact sheet on managing late blight. The key to managing blight is to remove every bit of diseased tissue and burn it. The pathogens overwinter in the plant debris and send out spores first thing in spring. Keep the soil mulched so rain won't splash pathogens on the leaves. Remove the lower leaves as soon as possible, and water only by drip irrigation. Late blight needs a wet leaf to infect the plant. If you are using chemical sprays, you have to stick to the spraying schedule to keep the plant protected. You can actually buy varieties that will grow well in pots on the patio. You might contact the dwarf tomato project to find some good varieties that grow in pots. That way you can completely change the soil every year. Tomatoes need full sun, dry leaves, good air circulation, enough water, and mulch on the soil.

  - I really need some more information in order to make a good assessment. There are several diseases that could be in play, but if the plant is healthy looking other than a few gray leaves, I would probably pick affected leaves off and discard in the trash. Don't just throw them on the ground. If the problem continues up the plant continue to pick affected leaves and begin using a sulfur dust or wettable sulfur or a labeled vegetable fungicide. You can buy these products at most lawn and garden supply outlets. Some of these problems exist in warm drier conditions, some in cooler damp conditions and it is a good idea to keep a little sulfur and a fungicide around when you see leaves starting to show signs of becoming un-healthy. These products will not always work , but will a lot of the time.Always follow label directions when using garden products.If you need more information please feel free to give me a call. 361-364-6234email- bobby.mccool@ag.tamu.edu

  - Hello:I don't think there is really a rule as to how far apart these two plants should be planted, only so far apart that they do not compete for light, water or rooting area, which might reduce yields of one or the other or both. Since individual cultivars of each plant grow to different sizes and vary in growth habit, it's hard to give a specific distance apart. We usually space vining-type tomatoes 2' apart, but with bushy spreading plants, you might give a bit more space. Feel free to write with questions.

## 51168_California
* askextension_tomato/51168_California
  - Hello,Thanks so much for submitting your question. There could be a few different things happening with your seeds. Your seeds might have dried out accidentally. The soil should be kept consistently moist during the germination period. When you are first adding soil to your containers be sure that is throughly moist before you add it to the container, but not sopping wet. When you squeeze a handful of it you want about 1-2 drops of water to trickle out. One trick I use is to put saran wrap over the seeds while they are germinating. That helps to preserve the moisture. Then I use a spray bottle to mist the top of the soil, so I'm not washing the seeds out of the pot with a watering can before they germinate. Also be sure to germinate the seeds in the dark, and then move them to the light right when they start poking through the soil. You may also want to check the date on your seed packet. They might be old seeds, or they have a low germination rate due to improper temperature storage. Humidity can shorten a seeds life. One great way to test seeds is to put 10 seeds inside a moist paper towel and put the towel in a sealed zip lock bag in a warm location. Check the seeds periodically to see how many of the 10 start to germinate. If only 1 or 2 germinate then your rate of germination is only 10-20% for those seeds. It's also helpful to have some heat on the bottom of tomatoes if you are germinating them indoors. A seedling heat meat that plugs into the wall works great and is easy to use. Tomatoes also take 5-6 days on average to germinate. Hope this helps! Good luck with your tomatoes.

## 51302_Colorado

  - Hi Bill,This is a problem that a lot of gardeners face. Soil fertility is not typically to blame when tomatoes won't ripen, however high levels of magnesium and low levels of potassium can lead to conditions like blotchy or uneven ripening or yellow shoulder disorder. Since yousaidthattheplantsarebig and lush, but never have many tomoatoes, that could be because theyneverproducemanyflowers. Whennitrogen levels are too high, the plant is putting all of its energy into the leaf production and not flower production.If you are concerned about your soil health, you can always do a soil test to find out exactly what you're working with. The Plant, Soil and Water lab on the CSU campus conducts these tests. More info can be found at this link.http://www.soiltestinglab.colostate.edu/documents/soilsample_horticulture.pdfI realize you mentioned that your tomatoes are getting enough warmth, water and sun, but it still may be one of these that is causing your issue.The optimum temperature for ripening tomatoes is 70 to 75F. When temperatures exceed 85 to 90 F, the ripening process slows significantly or even stops. At these temperatures, lycopene and carotene, pigments responsible for giving the fruit their typical orange to red appearance cannot be produced. As a result, the fruit can stay in a mature green phase for quite some time.Oftenitisadvisabletobegintolessenwaterasthe fruit reaches maturesizeandisripening.

  - For the Willamette Valley, you need to look for short growing season tomatoes, eggplants, and peppers. The last 2 summers have had plenty of heat, but that is not always the case. I like to plant several varieties with differernt maturing lengths to make sure that I actually get tomatoes. The big heirloom or "beefsteak" tomatoes don't always mature soon enough. Look for medium sized tomatoes. Check out Territorial Seed Company, Adaptive Seeds, Johnny's Selected Seeds, to give you an idea of what might work. Tomatoes that I aways plant are: Stupice, Siletz, and Legend, in addition to cherry and sauce tomatoes. Enjoy your tomato shopping!

  - Tomato blight is carried over from season to season in plant debris that drops to the ground. The blight is host specific, so the spores don't survive except on debris from the host plant. However, the blight spores can also travel in the air and infect your plants if the source is in your neighborhood.If you don't have a raised bed garden, I would make a raised tomato bed and add some top soil and then mulch. You don't want rain water to splash soil on the plant leaves. Then space your plants out to allow lots of air movement. Prune off the lower leaves and keep the plant out of contact with the soil. Since blights are a form of water mold, they need wet leaves to begin their infection process. Only water with soaker hoses that wet the ground but not the leaves. Inspect your plants regularly and immediately remove any plant parts that show signs of infection. Those signs mean the plant is infected and is ready to make spores, You want to cut off the spore making cycle asap. All plant debris you remove from this year and prior years must be burned or put in the garbage for collection. As long as the blight has host tissue, it can live in a dormant form. It cannot survive in the soil without host tissue. Here is a link to an excellent article on early blight of tomato and potato. Here is a link to a publication by Cornell University on late blight. Having had both in my garden, I feel your pain.

  - Yes, the larger containers should be washed and sterilized with a bleach solution before using again. When potting up, you can transplant the seedlings right up to the first set of true leaves whether it is tomato or eggplant. If you are referring to transplanting outside in thegarden,eggplant do not produce roots along the stem like tomatoes. To prevent legginess, keep the tops of the transplants 1-2 in. from the lights.

  - Did you buy the seeds or save them from the previous year's tomatoes? If they were purchased, they should be the variety on the label and would not change size due to any other crops growing nearby. If you planted seeds that you collected, they could be different as there could have been a small amount of cross pollination that would change the seeds, but tomatoes are self-fertile and seldom cross pollinate.Also, if the original plants were hybrids, plants from the seeds would be different than the original plants. Again, if the seeds were ones you purchased from a reputable supplier, you should have gotten what was on the label no matter what other varieties were nearby.

Keep checking your soil temp (with a soil thermometer) and when it is at least 60 during the day with air temp that will not freeze your plants you can begin planting.  If it is too cold your plants will have a slow start.  Essentially you will be having a monoculture in your high tunnel so you should be sure to leave enough room around each plant and provide good air circulation to help prevent disease.

  - Espon salt, Magnesium, is what you are most likely thinking of. I can not link to any research based information about using the salt directly but this is what I can share.If you are purchasing special tomato fertilizers some have magnesium added. So follow directions for application rates. Maybe some of the symptoms below sound like trouble you have had in the past. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency start at the bottom of the plant on older leaves and then works their way upward. Fruits appear to ripen evenly but maturity is often delayed. Deficiencies may also occur in the middle of the plant during heavy fruit load, but this is usually transient. Where deficiencies are less severe, older leaves look brittle and their interveinal tissue is curled up. Where deficiencies are severe, chlorosis between the veins progresses from the margins to the middle of the leaflets. The small veins also become chlorotic, but the bigger veins remain dark green. With ongoing magnesium starvation, the interveinal chlorosis becomes more intensive, the color turns to bright yelloworange and necrotic spots may appear, which can grow together into brown bands. Finally, the older leaves die and the whole plant turns yellow and fruit yield is severely reduced. Excess magnesium can result in an imbalance in, and expression of, calcium and/or potassium deficiency.http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/growing-tomatoes-peppers-and-eggplant/

  - There really is no need to put large cans around your tomatoes when you plant them. If you are planting very small plants into the garden in a very windy area a little protection until they have been out for a short time is ok but reallyunnecessary. Make sure that it isn't going to frost. Tomatoes need warm temps for growing.I would cage orput your stakes in at planting time so you don't damage the plants later.I don't think I would wrap aluminum foil around the stem as you could damage it in the process and it would also limit the plants ability to grow properly. Some people do insert a wooden match next to the stemor put cardboard collar around the stem if you are prone to having cutworm problems. They will both break down through the course of the year.

In addition to the low temperatures in the next few weeks, you may want to check the soil temperature, as tomatoes like their soil temperature to be above 40 degrees. The spring weather in southern Oregon is so changeable and while the temperature trend is upward, we can still have some frosty nights, especially for Ashland, which is a bit higher elevation than Medford. Most experienced gardeners in this area wait until about Mother's Day, May 9 this year.

  - HelloIt's not possible to make a definitive diagnosis from an image, but here are some questions/suggestions.... Have these seedlings been exposed to sudden changes in light/temperature? Some of the damage looks possibly like burning caused by a bit too sudden hardening off or placed too close to a window pane that had direct sun and/or too cold temps.The other worry I'd have, although these are very small plants, would be a fungus. Tomatoes outdoors are susceptible to several forms of blight. It would be odd to see this on indoor-grown seedlings but some of the leaf damage looks somewhat like blight. Was the potting mix you used sterile new mix or did it contain garden soil?Although the growing point on the one plant looks ok, even the leaves near the top are faded (chlorotic), this may indicate a problem with nutrients or pH level. Have you fertilized these guys yet? Sterile potting mix is fine for starting seeds, but contains little nutrient value, so a dilute fertilization every week or so is a good idea at least be the time the seedlings have their second second of true leaves.If you used sterile potting mix, make sure to give them some fertilizer. Remove the damaged leaves and dispose in the garbage (not your compost pile). Bring them gradually into full outdoor conditions over 10 days or so. They may be fine. If they continue to have faded damage leaves, it is best to destroy them and start again.

  - While milk sprays have been used by home gardeners, their effectiveness and the economics do not support this use.  In Kentucky we have early blight and late blight. Early blight starts at the bottom of the plant and works up. The fungal spores are present in the soil. So crop rotation, and good mulching will help to control the disease. Late blight is more sever and infects from the top down. What ever you use, adequate coverage and good air flow are critical. If you don't wish to use synthetic fungicides, copper is fairly effective if you get good coverage. Other synthetic fungicides are available and give very good results. I recommend contacting your county agent and requesting a copy of ID-128 Home Vegetable Gardening in Kentucky.

  - Each year tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, or potatoes are grown in buckets, the growing medium should be replaced the following year.  Of the 4 crops I listed, all of them are in the solanaceae family which means they get and share the same diseases.  Most of the diseases for these crops are soil borne. Here is a link to Tomato Diseases from Iowa State University explaining the diseases.  https://store.extensioniastate.edu/Product/pm1266-pdf. If this link does not work, Google Iowa State Tomato Diseases and it should come up. As for what to spray to hold the tomato diseases in check use Daconil or Fungonil. These are not organic sprays. Having said this they have been on the market for well over 30 years. Serenade is an organic OMRI certified fungicide that could be used. Google Serenade Garden Disease Control Concentrate. Whichever spray program you choose it is important to follow the label and spray as often as the label will let you to stay on top of these diseases.

  - 5 gallon buckets are great for tomatoes and zucchini--one plant per pot. Patio tomatoes have more compact root systems and can tolerate 3 gallon pots. Yield will be impacted by pot size, so you are better to use the 5 gallon size if you can. We have seen tomatoes growing in shallow pots, but yield is diminished and the need for frequent watering is increased. In other words there is no magic size that makes tomato plant growing possible. Give your plants a big pot. vw

  - The white growth on the tomato stem is either powdery mildew or scale. If it rubs off easily it is mildew. Mold is the most likely. Put the plants outside if you can and wash the stems with hydrogen peroxide 3%, something available at any pharmacy. The plants will probably have to be brought inside at night. Isolate the plants and do not keep them near the rest of your plants. Putting a fan on the other tomatoes will help prevent their infection. It was probably caused by wet soil. The spores are everywhere and it is a common problem.

Have you added any amendments to boost foliar growth such as a high nitrogen, organic fertilizer? Black spot usually indicates a fungal issue. You may not be getting enough air circulation where you planted your tomatoes. How much sun do you get during the day?

  - There are as many opinions on this as there are Master Gardeners.If you have lots of space, I recommend Sungold. Very prolific and very sweet, and good for a garden with lots of space. But it's gold-yellow, not red, if that matters. I also like black cherry, although it may not be as sweet as you like. It is another prolific variety.For larger varieties, you should decide about heirlooms vs. hybrids. Heirlooms are often better flavored, but they don't look as nice, are not as prolific, often are susceptible to disease, and sometimes don't keep well, indoors or outdoors. There are many lists online, but you may be restricted by what you find in the markets or garden centers. Since you have lots of space, try several varieties, picking from both heirloom and hybrid. And if you have the space, choose indeterminate varieties, which produce more fruit on bigger plants.This listmightbehelpfulifyouhaveafewcandidatesinmind:https://njaes.rutgers.edu/tomato-varieties/

  - Greetings, It's not a natural occurrence on all heirloom tomatoes, but some varieties are more susceptible than others. The larger the fruit the more likely it will have "catfacing" or cracking issues.  I found this on one of our websites: Cracking and catfacingoccur more in some varieties than others. Changes in conditions, such as high temperatures and moisture levels followed by dry weather, can cause tomatoes to crack near the stem end. Catfacing, caused by incomplete pollination in cold weather, is a malformation of the fruit on the blossom end, and is more common in larger tomatoes such as beefsteaks. To prevent either disorder, choose from among the many varieties that are resistant.

They are detailed in this OSU Extension publication: https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/search/content/blossom%20end%20rotTo summarize, limestone can be added at planting time; a high-phosphate fertilizer is good for tomatoes while they are growing; and if you get blossom end rot, you can spray with calcium chloride, since it is a calcium deficiency.

## 56811_Tennessee

  - The short answer is, you can't rid your soil of it. The fungus is in many places and will move. Eventually, as you found out, it found your raised beds. So, proactively, what can you do to avoid the fungus? First, resistant varieties are usually an option but not for early blight (I'm assuming this is the blight you're referring to). There are only a few that tout being resistant and you won't be able to just walk into a garden center and buy those.  Secondly, water only at the base of your plants, avoid wetting the foliage. I understand you can't avoid rain, but no wetting the foliage by your own hand. Foliage wetness drives disease. Third, mulch around the base of your plants. This will help stave off the disease for some time as it helps to alleviate soil splash from rain up to the lower leaves. This starts the disease cycle. Fourth, make sure you are trellising those tomatoes and that they are not allowed to fall over on the ground. Fifth, keep your tomatoes fertilized. Healthy plants are better at resisting disease than those that are starved. Lastly, proactively apply fungicides that contain chlorothalonil or mancozeb. Refer to labels and adhere to those -- they are the law. Protectant fungicides like these can be washed off with rainfall so the spray schedule tightens with rain.  Once the disease has started, it's very difficult to control unless we get a dry spring/summer. These fungicides are not curative, they can only provide protection from further infection.Good spray coverage is essential. Good luck.

Could be drift - if conditions are right (low humidity &amp; high temperature), herbicides can vaporize and be carried for a good distance). Also consider if compost was used and source of the compost and consider what you may be using as mulch - herbicides can often persist and the solanacea family of plants are susceptible.Contact your local Cooperative Extension Office and speak with an Agriculture or Horticulture Agent.

  - Unfortunately, yes. If you plant outside before the night-time temperatures are in the 50's, your plants may be stunted and yields reduced all summer.Definitely use walls of water type protectors as long as the temperatures warrant. Open them during the day when the sun is shining and temperatures are warm; close them at night. You also can employ frost blankets and 'hot caps' (like empty milk jugs with the bottoms cut off) to get a jump on Denver's short tomato season.The walls of water type protectors and tomato cages wrapped with frost cloth can do double duty by protecting your plants if hail is predicted.

  - Your tomato plant shows some possible signs of fungal disease, i.e., the small circular blotches. These could be the beginnings of 'early blight', but the majority of the damage along the edges of the foliage appears to be environmental damage. This could be the result of heavy winds, cool temperatures, fluctuations in temperature, etc. The slight puckering of the leaves could be varietal or possibly edema. This would be the case if the soil were saturated with moisture for a lengthy period of time. Sometimes, puckering is the result of aphid feeding, but we see not definitive evidence of aphid activity. In any case, your plant(s) should outgrow the problem. Continue to monitor the plants for any further signs of disease or insect activity and treat as necessary.The following page may provide some helpful hints:http://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetable-profiles-tomatoeshttp://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetables/common-problems-vegetablesLS

  - Hi,  Since you are going to grow indeterminate tomatoes, you'll need to make sure you have a good system for caging/staking them. As the tomatoes grow, they are going to become top heavy and cages and stakes can become unstable in the bale. You can buy larger tomato plants, if you like, but plants that already have little tomatoes on them really won't get you ahead as those little tomatoes usually do not survive the stress of being transplanted. Since you are getting a late start, you could consider an Early Girl that yields fruit in about 50 days. It will likely get over 6 feet tall, so be prepared for that. There is also a tomato called Glacier that is semi-determinate and yields in about 55 days. Glacier may be more difficult to find, however. As for a cherry, Supersweet 100s are very popular and are good producers. The same is true for Sungold which is a gold cherry. Enjoy those tomatoes!

## 57731_Michigan

  - It sounds like Septoria leaf spot, a common fungal disease of tomatoes. See if this matches what you see: the lower leaves get small, dark freckles on them that will enlarge to have tan or gray centers. The spots get a yellow halo around them wand then the leaf turns yellow and then brown. The leaf gets crispy and falls off and this works itself up the plant. You need to use a fungicide to prevent this... it is not curable. Start spraying the plant when the first tiny fruit appear or the end of June, whatever comes first. Use chlorothalonil which can be found in Daconil or Fungonil. If you are organic, you will have to search for a product. None are readily available. Follow the label directs which usually indicate that you are spraying the plants, tops and bottoms of leaves, on a 7 to 10 day repeat. If the plants get wet from overhead irrigation or it rains, they need to sprayed again. Use a pressurized sprayer that you have never used for a weed killer. Do not use a hose-end sprayer. There is too much water that washes off your fungicide. This is a disease solely of tomatoes, Something else is happening to the summer squash. It might be squash vine borer. Look it up online and see if it fits.

  - I found the following information from another master gardener that I would like to pass on to you: Flea beetle adults are metallic greenish brown to black in color and   from 0.06 to 0.12 inch long. Adults jump when disturbed. Larvae   [youngsters] live in the soil, are slender, whitish, and about 0.25 inch   long when mature.     Adult beetles chew numerous small holes in   leaves, giving them a sieve-like appearance. Larvae feed   on underground parts of the plant.     High populations of flea beetles   on seedlings may destroy a number of plants whereas leaf damage to   mature plants is not considered serious.  If mature plants are heavily   attacked, its likely theyre stressed for other reasons, among them   water, fertilizer, and/or extreme temperatures.Treat when you see   the very first small holes in the leaves.       If your tomato plants   are still productive, consider using a product with the active   ingredient azadirachtin which is labeled for use against flea beetles.    Apply according to label directions.  If the tomato plants are failing,   theyre likely past the point of no return; remove and discard them.      Next season, plant your tomatoes in a different area previously   unaffected by flea beetles.  Set transplants into the garden when   temperatures are consistently above 55  degrees, then immediately   protect with row cover which will warm the plants somewhat and will be a   barrier to the beetles.  You can remove the row cover when the plants   are ready to bloom.  All season, ensure the plants receive adequate   water and fertilizer so that the mature plants can withstand some   damage.

  - it is unlikely that your tomato plants are suffering from a virus. The stunted new growth could be herbicidal damage. If you or a neighbor has sprayed 2-4D recently to control weeds in the landscape, that chemical is notorious for drifting a great distance. Tomatoes are extremely sensitive to 2,4D as well as to glyphosate (Roundup). Having set your plants out on May 7, it is also likely that the slow growth is simply due to low air and soil temperatures. Tomatoes will not grow until the soil temperature reaches 65 deg. F and it is likely that that level has only been reached in the past several days.We would like to see some photos of your tomato plants in order to totally rule out the possibility of a viral infection.LS

  - The tomato fruit symptoms look like those caused by russet mite. It can be very destructive if not managed. I suggest taking fruit to local extension diagnostic laboratory. Mites can be hard to see, and a microscope is needed to identify the type. The leaf spots do not resemble those caused by any disease that I am aware of.  The large tan spots look like physical damage; possible causes include sunscald, burn from concentrated fertilizer on leaves, and herbicide.  The dark spots and yellowing could be due to mites (take these to extension with the fruit), and could be due to aging and nutrient deficiency.  I have seen similar on older leaves of my tomatoes especially when planting is delayed.

  - Diluted soaps have long been used as an insecticide, particularly for soft-bodied insects or larvae, but you have to actually get the spray on the insects for it to be effective. Once it dries it has no residual activity. Soaps manufactured for spraying on plants are what should be used. Dishwashing "soap" may actually be a detergent that has more in it than just soap. Detergents can cause damage to the waxy cuticle of leaves of many different kinds of plants, depending on the concentration, weather conditions and the kind of plant. I do not know that tomatoes in genera are more resistant to damage from these detergents but I would certainly be cautious. Detergents and soaps also break the surface tension of water so that water is less likely to bead up on the surface of a leaf. But, as far as helping to absorb water, tomatoes take up almost all of their water through their roots, not their leaves so this should not really help the plants to take up water. So, in response to your final question, I would not suggest you spray your tomatoes with diluted soap solutions, unless it is an insecticidal soap and then only when you had a pest problem you were trying to treat.

  - We have two seasons here in Florida for tomatoes--spring and fall. The cultivar Heat Wave can still be planted but it is too late for the other varieties. Even Heat Wave will have problems because by the time you will be ready to harvest the night temperature are still too high and gives the plant no night relief from the heat stress.I am including the an excellent vegetable plant guide by UF/IFAS.

  - We think the leaves on your plants are way to close to the soil and there should be mulch around them to prevent disease.There are some reasons for pruning tomato plants. It's helpful to  understand the difference between "determinate" and "indeterminate"  plants.    Determinate tomatoes are tomato varieties that grow a certain  amount. The amount of fruit and foliage they will produce is  determined. If you prune a branch of a determinate tomato, you've lost  the branch and all the fruit that branch will produce. So generally  speaking, don't prune determinate tomatoes. Determinates generally  produce their fruit all at once. Determinate plants are bushier and  smaller.    Indeterminate tomatoes will continue to grow until frost.  Pruning them may reduce fruit production somewhat, but not as much as  pruning determinates. Main crop tomatoes, such as Big Boy, Beefmaster,  and many heirlooms are typically indeterminate, but there are  exceptions.    Now for the reasons for pruning tomatoes:    First, to  prevent or slow disease. This applies to indeterminates and determinates  alike. Any diseased branch should be pruned. Also, the branches near  the ground are pruned, so that no leaves are on or near the ground. This  helps prevent fungal diseases such as Septoria leaf spot.    Second, to  train indeterminate tomatoes. In indeterminate tomatoes, new branches  form in the crotch between a stem and branch. To keep indeterminate  tomatoes off the ground (where they can fall victim to disease and  insects), the plants are staked, caged, or trellised. It is often easier  to do this if the tomato plant has only a few main branches, so the  suckers are removed. However, once the sucker is longer than 3 or 4  inches, it is better just to let it go rather than cut it. A large cut  stresses the plant, creates a disease pathway, and can increase the  likelihood of fruit cracking and leaf curl. So you can see there are  advantages and disadvantages to both.

  - The flecking (smaller spots) is likely damage caused by flee beetles.  They are a difficult insect to control but are normally not a serious issue for healthandgrowing plants and less of a problem as plants get larger.

  - Based on ;your description it sounds like your patio tomatoes are planted in containers. If so, you may be dealing with fungus gnats. The larvae breed in moist soil rich in organic matter, primarily in potted plants. They feed on the fungi in the soil. Overwatering contributes to the growth of the fungi. Allow the top several inches of soil in your containers dry before watering again. Also, do not allow the pot to stand in water or for water to accumulate in pot saucers. See our website for more informationhttp://extension.umd.edu/hgic/fungus-gnats-houseplants        If this is not what you are noticing, send us photos.   mh

  - Caterpillars and perhaps skeletonizing leaf beetles.Chemical treatment of skeletonized leaves on plantscan be simple but they have already gotten far on your plants. I suspect the vigor of your tomato plants has been greatly reduced. Natural chemical treatments are the healthiest option for the garden. UseNeem or horticultural grade oil, insecticidal soap and blasts of water to remove the insects and their larvae are often effective. Larvae are most affected when treated young in the spring and early summer. Bacillus thuringiensis(BT) may prove to control many of the larvae as it is target specific to caterpillars and worms. It is a naturally occurring bacterium that is not harmful to most beneficial insects. The most effective way to stop skeletonization of leaves is to get out into the garden every day and look for damage. Jump on the treatment of your choice as soon as possible to save your plants foliage and health.Let me know if you have any other questions. A

  - This looks like herbicide damage, probably from a phenoxy type herbicide. Has the client done any spraying in their yard for dandelions or other broadleaf weeds using a product that has 2,4-D or Banvel? Any spraying in the area, nearby fields, road ditches etc? Mulched with grass clippings from a lawn that was sprayed a days or a few weeks ago? Not really anything that can be done. It does not look too severe so I am guessing the plants will improve in appearance and may grow out of it before they really start fruiting. However, there could still be some pesticide residue in the fruit so technically it should not be consumed.

  - Hi, and thanks for contacting AaE.There are fertilizers especially formulated for tomatoes and other veggies. They have a lower nitrogen content and a higher potassium content which is better for growing fruit (rather than leaves).The strawberries can be overwintered in the pot. One of the best ways is to place the container in a bigger container and then insulate the space between with leaves or straw.  You can also place the container on the ground next to a heated wall and ideally out of the winter wind. Insulate the exposed sides of the container with mulch, leaves or straw. Or just bury the container. The surrounding soil will insulate the roots over winter. Then dig up and hose down the container next spring.   Yet another option is to take the container into an unheated shed or garage for winter. Don't worry about lack of light. The plants will be dormant and don't need light in winter. You'll probably have to add just a little water every few weeks to keep the roots from getting too dry. Outside, melting snow and occasional cold rains usually keep the roots damp enough over winter without you having to water them.

  - The most likely reason is from water stress but we have also had wide temperature swings. Ensure your plants get consistent watering. You may also want to check that the water is getting to the roots of your plants. I prefer to water my tomato plants deeply once per week and then use mulch to help prevent evaporation as the weather gets hot. What tomatoes don't like is inconsistent watering. Another cause could be aphids which will feed on the tender leaves and cause curling as the leaves grow. It's more important to manage the aphids--a firm water spray is usually enough to know them out, but insecticidal soap is also effective, but may need to be reapplied after heavy rains. Thank you for your question and good luck!

  - Dear Steve,     From your description and the photo, we think your tomatoes have either Early Blight or Septoria Leaf Spot. Both are treated with fungicides containing Captan and will probably need repeated applications. The inoculum is in the soil so it is important to rotate the tomatoes into different soil each year.  This may explain why you've dealt with it for several years, but the plants may also have been infected when you bought them.  It also helps not to handle the plants when wet.

  - The small holes being eaten into your tomato leaves are caused by flea beetles. These beetles will attack all members of the tomato family, but are especially serious to eggplant. They are small, hard-shelled insects that jump like fleas. Most plants can tolerate the amount of damage you are showing here without loss of yield or quality; however, if the feeding damage continues to worsen, you may want to control the beetles.  Recommended products include: synthetic pyrethroids (permethrin, bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, etc.) andcarbaryl (Sevin). Be sure to read and follow all label directions before buying and using any pesticide.

  - I read the report, and I think that part is something for commercial growers. In your case, I would start by removing the suckers close to the ground, In fact, I prune off the bottom leaves as the plant grows because they are prone to fungal infections. You don't have to be so concerned about production as a commercial grower. In the home garden, it's better to have fewer tomatoes that are really good. If you keep the plant thinned out enough to let the air flow through and keep the leaves dry, you will avoid a lot of problems with infection.

  - Looks like your tomatoes have septoria leaf spot. It's been an incredibly common disease this year because of the rain. You can't do anything about the leaves already infected, but you can prevent it from spreading. Remove the dead leaves that fall and plant a different vegetable there next garden season. Use a chlorothalonil, copper fungicide, or mancozeb fungicide. I'm not sure if the neem oil will work or not. If you use it, I would recommend just trying it on one plant instead of all. One note about it though-when spraying with Neem oil, make sure you do it when it's cool (below 85 F, for however long it takes to dry). Otherwise, it might burn the plants.

If possible, fence the tomatoes including fencing over the top of the plant. You can build a cage using fencing from a hardware store or purchase some kind of barrier from a garden supply company.Repellents - usually scent-related - require regular application especially after rain. Deer ma also become used to a repellent meaning you need to change repellents every so often to keep the deer away. Some trials have shown repellents based on eggs are the most effective. Home remedies like Irish Spring soap, human or pet hair, etc. have not shown to be not reliably effective.

Covering with clear plastic is one way to do that, as is not irrigating with overhead watering/sprinkler,removing the leaves close to the bottom of the plant that might touch the soil, and using a mulch like straw to prevent any water from splashing up onto the plant when you do irrigate at the base. Covering with clear plastic provides additional heat that will allow plants to grow faster and results in better yields--but do allow some ventilation, especially with high daytime summer temperatures.Alightweight floating row cover can be used as well but does allow rain to penetrate.

Before you apply Epsom salts, you should have your soil tested to determine whether there is a magnesium deficiency. If you don't test your soil and your soil isn't deficient in magnesium and you then apply Epsom salts, you could end up with too much magnesium in the soil, which isn't good either.

  - This information comes from the 'Aggie Horticulture' web site.  Hope it helps... 42.Q. I planted the tomato varieties which you recommended and they are loaded with tomatoes. Now the leaves are beginning to turn yellow, then brown, then die from the bottom of the plant. What should I do; will this kill my plants? A. You and everybody growing tomatoes are having the same problem. Tomato plants are developing brown spots on the lower foliage. This is the result of a fungus infecting the foliage causing a disease known as early blight. Early blight is an annual problem for most gardeners. It normally develops into a problem when plants have a heavy fruit set and the area has received rainfall. Spores from the fungus are spread to the lower foliage by wind and splashing rain. Leaves must be wet for infection to occur. At 50 degrees F. the leaves must be wet for 12 hours for infection, but at temperatures above 59 degrees F., the length of time for infection is only 3 hours. Leaf spot development is most severe during periods of cloudy days and high humidity. To control the fungus, foliage applications of a fungicide must be made every 7 days until moist conditions (dew included!) no longer exist. Applications should begin when the first fruit is slightly larger than a quarter. Chlorothalonil (Ortho Multipurpose Fungicide or Fertilome Broad Spectrum Fungicide) and mancozeb hydroxide (Kocide 101) are fungicides used on tomatoes for early blight. The copper fungicides also are affective against the foliage and fruit-infecting bacterial pathogens. Benlate (Greenlight Systemic Fungicide) should also be added every second spray application to prevent Septoria leaf spot. All listed fungicides can be mixed with insecticides or other fungicides except the copper-based materials (Kocide). The copper fungicides have a high pH which will reduce the life of many insecticides and some fungicides. Kocide is the only effective organic control for this pestilence.

  - Hello,It looks like you have psyllids also colorfully known as "jumping plant lice". The sugar-like substance in the tomato photo is a perfect example of their frass (poo). Control is very, very difficult, since the insects feed on the bottom of the leaves. But since it's early in the season, I would recommend you try to control them. Here is information from the CSU Extension Fact Sheet for control:Among insecticides available to homeowners, products containing permethrin or esfenvalerate are most effective when used at rates labelled for other potato/tomato insects. Alternately dusts of sulfur can provide control. Regardless, application must be thorough, covering the underside of lower leaves where the insects tend to concentrate. Insecticidal soaps (two percent concentration) may also be useful, although control is more erratic.If you wish to not control them, them remove the plants and throw them in the trash (do not compost). The psyllids will essentially suck all juice (and life) from the tomatoes.

  - Your tomato have been damaged by herbicide; this may occur in one of two ways: Spray drift when weeds were treated, or by herbicide carryover in organic materials added to or on the soil, among them manures, composted or not.   Unfortunately, this has been a widespread problem across the country for a number of years.    The underlying situation is that one of several different agricultural herbicides were used against broadleaf weeds in such crops as pastures or grain fields. (Such contamination has also occurred in commercially packaged composts and potting mixes.)    When livestock feed on the grass or grain, these herbicides survive the trip through the animals guts and are excreted in the manure which is then composted. In order for the chemicals to be inactivated, the manure must be hot composted for a year before use in gardens.    Here are several helpful resources which describe how the damage occurred; how to verify the contamination via a simple bio-assay; and what you can do to remedy the situation.   - Page 3 of Herbicide carryover in hay, manure, compost, and grass clippings describes an easy bio-assay you can do: http://content.ces.ncsu.edu/herbicide-carryover    - Numerous images of various affected plants as well as informative text (via the menu at left of the page) including a bio-assay are in Herbicide Contamination Organic Matter: (http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/aminopyralid/)   As a safety measure, I now suggest gardeners do a bio-assay prior to using any composted materials obtained from other sources.

## 61934_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/61934_Oregon
  - Thanks for your tomato leaf spot question.  What you describe sounds like tomato early leaf blight.  It is a fungal disease (alternaria).  This fungus can overwinter in organic matter and the leaf symptoms appear during periods of cool, wet weather.  With warmer temperatures, the fungus symptoms recede.   With the following care suggestions, your tomato can recover.  Immediately remove the spotted leaves and do not compost them.  Water as needed at the plant base, preferably early in the day, do not overhead water and also give the plant good air circulation.  Tomatoes benefit from regular feeding.  If the watering schedule is irregular the plants will also benefit from mulching.  In future, do not plant your tomatoes in the same soil location and completely remove all season-end tomato debris.

If so the problem will clear up once the summer gets underway.Remove the affected leaves and provide enough sun and water for the plants.If it's not due to the weather then it could be the beginning of Blight - This is a fungal disease, characterized by spots on lower leaves and stems that appear water-soaked. Avoid overhead watering, and remove diseased leaves.Thanks

  - Adding fish, even the salted, preserved anchovies, changes the heat transfer and processing requirements of a tomato based product. I searched but could not find any instructions or even research conducted for preserving a product like this. I would not even suggest the timing for fish, since the anchovies are such an unknown pH and texture for heating. This should freeze safely. Or, consider adding the anchovies to the product when you open the jars of tomato sauce.

## 61969_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/61969_Oregon
  - I wouldn't suggest trying to re-can the sauce. Once it's been cooked and canned then opened and reheated, the heat transfer in it and the pH is uncertain, so safe processing times would be difficult to determine.  Freezing has so few safety concerns, that would be the way to preserve it.

## 62041_Virginia

  - Hello, Tomato leaves turning yellow can be a symptom of several problems: Lack of water: The leaf does not look water deprived, but this can be an issue.  Interestingly, too much water can also sometimes look like too little water.  If the roots are dying from drowning, they cannot function well enough to support the water needs of the plant top and you get dieback.  Lack of light:  if the plant is shaded on one side those leaves will turn yellow and eventually, shrivel and fall off.  Normal aging is related to lack of light as the lower leaves become shaded by the new upper leaves. Lack of nutrients:  are you growing in a container or the soil? If not, did you do a soil test in the last 2-3 years?  Have you applied a Nitrogen source this year to your crop?  Tomatoes are heavy feeders, leaf mulch is not enough.   There are a number of tomato diseases the early symptoms of which can look like this.

  - Hello, The pictures appear to be from the lower leaves of the plant. The yellowing looks like a nutrient deficiency possibly phosphorous or potassium. The two outside pictures also appear to have a large amount of thrips damage. Thrips damage the leaves by sucking the chlorophyll out of the leaf leaving the cells empty. This can endup being a fairly large area on the leaf if the thrips numbers are high enough.The tan spots with the dark flecks in them is typical for thrips chewing on the leaves.  The middle picture is a little more interesting.This looks to be more like a leaf mold. It tends to be worse in greenhouses where humidity levels are high. Foliage is the only thing effected by this mold. Older leaves are affected first. Minimize long periods of leaf wetness and high relative humidity should be minimized by avoiding the watering of foliage and by circulating air with fans. Night temperatures should be maintained at a higher level than outside temperatures.

  - It could be lack of moisture that is deep or wide enough. Check the soil moisture. There should be 12 inches of damp soil. It should be as damp as a squeezed sponge or a damp wrung-out washcloth. When tomatoes are producing flowers and fruit, the plant needs plenty of moisture. Is there a black walnut tree within 50 or so feet of the tomato? The juglone in the black walnut can cause wilting and death of tomatoes. There's no fixing that.

  - Thank you for attaching the images which verify that your diagnosis is accurate. Your tomatoes have been affected by herbicide which may have been from one or more of several sources:   1. You used a sprayer which previously held herbicide.   2. Herbicide was applied nearby and, then, the tomatoes were affected either by off-target spray drift or, if the temperatures exceeded 80F, volatilized herbicide.   3. Herbicide carryover due to the presence of long-lasting herbicides present in composted organic matter such as composted manure, either commercially packaged or from a local farmer.   Herbicide carryover has been troubling home gardeners for approximately 10 years. Of all the plants in vegetable gardens, tomatoes are the most susceptible to damage.    Numerous images of such damage are here: http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/aminopyralid/.    If you suspect herbicide carryover may be the source of the distorted growth, please review this link, beginning on page 2: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/sam/nl/11-summer.pdf. And, then, to verify the source of the contamination, do the simple bioassay described in the link at the end of the article.

Tutu fabric can be purchased cheaply from fabric stores and could be used. Paper bags could be put over the tomatoes. The main thing is to put something over the developing tomatoes. Sometimes some critters are deterred by a concoction with red peppers. Put red peppers in a blender with water and spray the sieved liquid on the tomatoes. Wash them before you eat them.

  - Lower leaves on tomato plants often turn brown and drop off, especially below the first fruit. They don't get enough sun to warrant the investment by the plant in keeping them. I prune all the leaves below the first fruit bearing branch, remove the suckers and thin the foliage where it is crowded. This is to give enough light and air flow so the tomato plant is less likely to get early blight. Since I use tomato cages instead of stakes, I also cut off the tops at the point where they start to overflow the cage. This controls the height of my plant, but also prevents it from producing any more fruit on the stalk I top. To compensate, I let some of the suckers grow.

Itcan occur and any stage of a tomato plant development especially after heavy rains or when it is wet and warm. Spores are spread by wind/rain, insects, splashing rain. Symptoms to look for areusually observed first on the lower leaves. Leaves that are heavily infected have small circular brown spots, turn yellow, dry up and drop off. The fungus is not soil inhabitant but can persist from one season to the next if the debris from the diseased plant is not removed and ends up in the soil.CONTROL:Copper fungicides, Green Cure (potassium bicarbonate), Serenade (QST 713 strain of Bacillus subtilis), a biofungicide, helps more to prevent disease.Let me know if you have further questions.

  - It looks like you may have a case of Early Blight, a diseasecaused by the fungusAlternaria solani. Itis common on garden tomatoes and usually shows up around now when the plants start to set fruit. Symptoms typically start on the lower leaves as tiny dark brown spots which enlarge. As the disease progresses, leaves turn yellow and the spots make them appear "freckled.  Eventually the leaves turn brown and drop off.  Blackpycnidia(fungal fruiting bodies that appear as pinhole sized black dots) form in the center of the spots as they mature.  Figure 1.  Yellowing of lower leaves with brown " halo target" marking from Early Blight. [USDA] The best thing to do is remove the infected foliage, tryingnot to knockspores from those leavesonto uninfected leaves. As the disease is favored byoverhead irrigation, water your plants from below. You can remove 8" to 12"of the bottom foliage to help you with that.Depending on how big and leafy your plant is, you might remove some of the extraneous foliage to allow more sun and air into the center of the plant (not too much or the fruit will get sunburn!). In the garden, the fungus can over-winter on diseased plant debris so it is important to clean up and discard infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - It sounds like several things going on at once. The bottom leaves on tomato plants often turn brown and die as the plant gains height. Before acting on the pH, I recommend you get a soil test kit from your local Penn State Extension. Here is a link to their website.I have new raised beds this year and my pH probe tested acidic. However, when my soil test came back, I was alkaline. I corrected the problem by top dressing with composted manure. Don't forget that this is new soil that hasn't yet weathered in, and that your plants are doing fine. Penn State will give you a complete profile of you soil and tell you exactly what to do to correct deficiencies.

  - Stephanie,  I can't tell what is going on with your tomatoes from photo.  It does not look like any kind of plant disease or insect injury. The leaf scorching may be the result of poor rooting or poor root development in a compacted clay soil. The leaf rolling, called "physiological leaf roll" is often attributed to drought stresses. You might try mulching around the tomato plants to help keep soil moist and a bit cooler.  Keep mulch away from touching tomato stem. Try to amend (improve) this soil by mixing in some organic matter this fall.  See also: http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/choosing-a-soil-amendment/

## 64481_Michigan

  - This appears to be bacterial spot, which affect the leaves and fruits of both tomatoes and peppers, usually due to moist, humid conditions. Fruit spots are conspicuous on green fruit and appear raised and scabby, brown in color, circular, surrounded by a yellow halo, and are up to 1/3 on an inch in diameter. Spots on ripe fruit are similar except that they are sunken. Spots can appear on both leaves and fruit, but they are most commonly found on fruit.   Control of bacterial spot is difficult once it becomes established in a tomato planting. The pathogen that causes this disease may be introduced on infected seeds or transplants. It can survive up to a year on plant debris that was infected the prior year. It becomes active once temperatures heat to the 80s and 90s, and when several hours of moist conditions occur. The bacteria are splashed onto leaves and fruit, causing infections. If conditions stay moist, new infections will continue until the plants are removed.    Good sanitation (removing weeds and all plant debris at the end of the season), mulching (to prevent water splash from the soil), Irrigating from the ground (to limit foliar wetness), pruning to promote good airflow, staking plants up from the ground, and removing the lowest leaves on the plants is important. Remove and destroy diseased crop debris or incorporate it into soil soon after harvest is complete. Rotate tomato planting's with crops other than tomato and pepper to avoid carryover of bacteria from year to year. Using drip irrigation reduces bacterial spread and the leaf wetness periods that favor infection compared to sprinkler irrigation. Avoid working in plantings when foliage is wet. Intensive spraying of bactericides (mixtures of copper + fungicide) may reduce disease development.     I hope this was helpful. Feel free to contact us again if you have further questions.

  - A good mixture of potting soil loaded with amendments (compost or fish fertilizer for nitrogen), phosphorus, bone meal (for calcium) and some epsom salt (for magnesium to prevent blossom end rot) ,will do the trick.

You could use a copper-based fungicide to protect the living plants.At the end of the season, remove all plant debris. If you have any potatoes, remove those as well and be sure to get all the tubers.This disease only happens when the conditions are right in the spring (cool and wet), so it is hard to say what to do next spring. If they are cool and wet, you can use the copper in the spring, even though the plants may look healthy. Otherwise, don't bother. Be sure to rotate the crops in your planting beds. Remove any volunteer tomatoes. Stake your plants early, and get good aeration between plants. (Looks like they are a little crowded).Email me directly if you have any further questions: marion.murray@usu.edu.

  - Most likely, the answer to this puzzle will be found in how the tomatoes are grown. Commercial growers use only vigorous transplants and are very attentive to using well-drained soil (or planting mix), along with supplying appropriate amounts of water, fertilizer, temperature, light exposure, and training system. These links should provide considerable assistance:    - Grow your own is an overview of vegetable gardening in the northwest; page 7 lists planting dates; youre in Region 2.    - Tomatoes  Backyard Abundance is much more specific about whats required to grow an abundant crop and states that a 10-foot row could yield 60 pounds- https://store.extension.iastate.edu/Product/pm608-pdf    - Grow your own tomatoes and tomatillos is specifically for the northwest - https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/ec1333.pdf    Consider getting a complete soil test from a professional lab. When you contact them, explain that the test is for a home garden and you need recommendations for growing tomatoes. Nearby A&amp;L Labs is handy, phone (503) 968-9225.    Good luck in your garden!

  - HiIt's hard to say without seeing the plants. Are there any insects? Aphids can sometimes cause leaves to curl, but are easily brushed off with a blast of water. Is there any possibility of contamination from herbicide applications nearby? Sometimes folks apply lawn weedkillers in windy conditions, causing the herbicide to drift over areas they don't intend. There are also possible virus infections, but that would be more difficult to diagnose. Here is a document from Texas that explains several causes of leaf curl in tomatoes: http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/vegetable/files/2010/10/E-626-What-Makes-Tomato-Leaves-Twist-or-C...Goodluck!

  - There can be several reasons for failure to flower or fruit. Excessive nitrogen can cause unusually tall lush plants at the expense of flowering. Limited sunlight - has your garden gotten shadier over the years? Plants require a minimum of 6 hours of direct daily sunlight. They are more productive with 8-10 hours.High or low temperatures and hot dry winds - Plants often stop producing blossoms and fruits during mid-summer if temperatures are high. Tomato- flower and fruit production diminishes when temperatures are below 55 F. or above 95 F.  Locating tomato plants so they receive late afternoon shade can also help improve season-long yields. Provide vegetable plants with adequate sunlight, water and nutrients.mh

  - The tomato fruitworm feeds on tomato, corn and cotton and is also called the corn earworm or the cotton bollworm. It also attacks soybeans, peppers, tobacco, beans, okra and eggplant. The adult tomato fruitworm is a moth. It is usually light yellowish-olive with a single dark spot near the center of each forewing. It lays eggs singly, usually on the lower sides of leaflets close to the flower or fruits. The eggs are creamy white when laid but develop a reddish-brown band just prior to hatching. Larvae (caterpillars) hatch from the eggs. The larvae are yellowish-white with a brown head. The color of older larvae varies from greenish-yellow to brown or even black with paler stripes running lengthwise on the body. Larvae grow to a size of about 1 inches in length. There are other worms that affect tomatoes that are explained in the article.    http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/plant_pests/veg_fruit/hgic2218.html    I like to use insecticidal soaps against caterpillars.

  - The adult tomato horn worm is a large moth that can find tomato plants by scent. Here is a link to a description of the horn worm. You can defeat the horn worm by covering your plants with netting that doesn't admit the sphinx moth, a fairly large moth. There is a variety of netting on sale that admits various degrees of light. You need to look at 95-98% light admitting net.Before you net, wash your tomato leaves and stems with insecticidal soap to get rid of eggs. I use net fruit bags on the tomato fruit and don't net my plants. Instead, I keep after the leaf eaters.

You are not the only one asking this type of question.  I have attached a couple of publications with general information that can help you.     Have you used the same soil every year?  You need to start with fresh disease free soil every year.   It soundslikeaculturalissue.When was the last time you fertilized the plants?  Containers plants use up nutrients quickly, so they need a slow release fertilizer or need frequent fertilizing. Anther causeof thesymptoms youareseeingcouldbe thattheplants aregettingtoo muchshade.   http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/container-gardens-7-238/   From this publication:   Soil Mixes   The potting soil you choose should be free of disease organisms, insects, and weed seeds. It should be porous yet hold water and nutrients with a slightly acidic pH. Do not use native soil, even if you can pasteurize it. Most native soils have a high percentage of clay particles that easily compact reducing the oxygen that is available to the roots. Purchased potting soil may contain pasteurized soil, sphagnum peat moss, vermiculite, perlite, and composted manure.   Fertilizing  The rapid growth of many container plants quickly depletes the fertilizer available in the limited volume of soil. Well-drained soil mixes also result in the regular loss of fertilizer in the drainage water.   This plant talk covers a lot of tomato problems.   http://www.ext.colostate.edu/ptlk/1835.html   Thank you so much for your Ask an Expert Questions.

  - These are adventitious roots, and are perfectly normal on tomato plants. If your tomato's stems touched the soil, or you planted that part of the tomato plant in soil, those rootlets would be activated to begin growing like normal roots. Look at images in a search engine to see more.ECN

  - It is normal for the bottom leaves to yellow and drop as the plant ages. If you are noticing browning and leaf spotting, tomatoes can be susceptible to several foliar diseases. Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. Select disease resistant varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage, they are not curatives. It is too late to spray. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - Don't worry about your zucchini plants. The first blossoms are male; female flowers are later. You will probably get alot of fruit later. Photos would have been helpful regarding your tomatoes.  If tomatoes are wilting, usually it is a lack of moisture or a problem with the root system.  However, if they are overwatered, the leaves also wilt.  In all cases, the problem is at the roots.  I can only suggest that you dig down around a plant or two and see what is going on.  Are the roots firm and white or soft and mushy.  If the latter, that is too much moisture.  Depending on your soil and any amendments you have used and whether the amendments were mixed in or just put on top, that also is a factor.

  - Many critters nibble on tomatoes--birds, squirrels, turtles, groundhogs, etc. You could consider putting paper bags or old pantyhose over the tomatoes to keep the critters off. If you want to know what is doing the nibbling, you could put out boards and sprinkle lime or flour over them and hopefully, you will see some identifiable footprints. You could also borrow a motion detector camera from a hunter. Another possibilitywould be to sprinkle a dusting of lime over the tomatoes to discourage the animals from nibbling. vw

  - Your tomatoes look like they were subject to a type of environmental issue as well as a fungal leaf spot. the leaves look like they may have been sprayed with a pesticide or possible fertilizer burn. The area looks hot and dry, crowded, with poor air circulation.  Tomatoes need 4-6 sq ft of growing area and will be more productive with 8-10 hours of sunlight. Provide consistent moisture and mulch with an organic mulch to keep weeds down.

In late stages, the stem may become hollow.

  - Thank you for the opportunity to assist you. It is difficult to confirm with total accuracty without having a plant to work with. I would agree it appears to be septoria leaf spot, and to be safe for NEXT year you would need to destroy all the wooden stakes you use. Move your planting to a new area next year. Most fungicides registered for use on tomatoes would effectively control Septoria leaf spot. These include maneb, mancozeb, chlorothalonil.If it is other blights, then it will be difficult to control for the year.Remove damaged leaves and do not compost them. Totally remove them from the site.

  - The best way to control them is to drop them into a pail of soapy water rather than apply an insecticide.

  - It's difficult to say for sure but I wonder if they are just in too small a pot for the plants and if they probably need water almost every day if it doesn't rain. If you used new potting soil when you planted them then you shouldn't have tomato blight. When you water you should water the soil only and not wet the whole plant. It is best to water in the morning rather than at night so that plants can dry off. It is possible that you have a bacterial disease or the plants could just be stressed by too large a root system in too small a pot. You could still try putting them into pots about twice the size you have. Make sure that the pots drain and when you water, water until the soil in completely wet all the way through. I would remove the damaged leaves and dispose of them. You could also have some fertilizer burn from too much fertilizer. Make sure you use something labeled for tomatoes and follow the label intructions.

  - Hi,I am suspicious that you have a Psyllids: here is an excerpt from one of the CSU documents, http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4dmg/Pests/tompests.htmThough hornworns are large, the most damaging tomato insect often is the over-looked potato/tomato psyllid. Developing psyllids are small (aphid-sized), pale green or yellow, and somewhat scale-like in appearance. Adults are banded black and white and jump readily when disturbed. Psyllids feed on the underside of leaves, sucking plant sap and introducing a saliva that disrupts plant growth. New growth may appear twisted and discolored. Tomatoes from psyllid-infested plants are small and mealy textured. Psyllid-injured Big Boy and other tomato varieties may grow no larger than a small marble. Tomato psyllids do not occur regularly, as they overwinter in southern areas and are carried by winds into Colorado. Heavy flights were detected in several locations earlier this year. Check plants for evidence of psyllids, and look for their characteristic droppings that consist of small waxy beads. These droppings also resemble granulated sugar or salt. Controls are warranted when psyllids are present. Sulfur dusts, permethrin, esfenvalerate or insecticidal soaps are effective treatments. Apply thoroughly, including on leaf undersides, where psyllids nymphs occur. Seehttp://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4dmg/Pests/psyllids.htm.

  - Tomato hornworms, slugs, picnic beetles, corn earworms, and squirrels all eat ripe tomatoes. Caterpillars (worms) can be handpicked and disposed of, or the leaves of plants can be sprayed with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), a product that only affects caterpillars. You may want to try harvesting a little earlier.

  - Hard to diagnose individual issues - but suffice it to say, your garden doesn't sound healthy. Based on what you wrote, I suspect you have a fungal disease (possibly caused by over-watering), and possibly pests -- for example, birds will nip at ripening tomatoes. Veggies only have a short life-span, so if any health issue crops up during their growing period, it is virtually impossible to correct and reverse;typically you either lose the plant, or simply endureless-than-ideal quality veg, and then try again next year. All that said - you can't get sick from eating these veggies - so I suggest that if they seem good enough to eat, then do so; otherwise, throw them out. I'd also suggest pulling off tomatoes once they first show signs of ripening. Once the ripening process starts, a tomato will fully ripen off-the-vine, so removing them from the plant, then putting them in a 'safe' area to fully ripen may keep them in better condition. Cukes will always go from green to yellowish if they are over-ripe - I suggest pulling any that are fully green, and not waiting any longer. Good luck!

## 65814_Colorado

  - Hello,You have blossom-end rot, which is a common problem of tomatoes. It's caused by inconsistent watering (too much, too little) as the fruit develops and stems from a calcium deficiency. As the fruit is forming, it needs calcium to develop, but if water isn't readily available, the calcium doesn't move with the fruit development (it's an immobile element). So regular watering is key. It can also occur with rapid temperature changes.The fruit is still edible, but you'll have to remove the "rotted" portion, which can be a significant portion of the tomato. Adjust your irrigation to be more consistent and consider applying organic mulch to help prevent evaporation from the soil surface.Here is more information: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/ptlk/1471.html

  - It could be a spray burn, but I really don't think so; there is not really anything in the spray mixture that would cause a burn, although sometimes you do get a reaction with daconil and other products. I also don't think it is a disease reaction; it actually looks more like the aftermath of spider mite feeding. So you may check for spider mites and go from there; if severely infested your best bet is to take these plants out and start over. Fall is typically a great gardening season in Texas. Good luck!!

## 66173_Iowa
* askextension_tomato/66173_Iowa
  - Some type of disease is probably responsible for the yellowing and  wilting of the leaves on the lower half of the tomato plants.  Removing  affected leaves may slow down the disease.  To effectively control  foliar diseases with fungicides, it's necessary to begin applying  fungicides at the first sign of symptoms.  At this point, it may be too  late to effectively control foliar diseases on tomatoes.  When  the plants die, carefully remove as much of the plant debris as possible  and destroy it.  Next spring, choose a different planting site for the  tomatoes.  Preferably a site where tomatoes have not been for 3 years.

## 66207_Pennsylvania
* askextension_tomato/66207_Pennsylvania
  - According to a Penn State pest alert, late blight of tomato is sweeping across Pennsylvania. Once the tomato plant is infected, the whole plant should be removed as quickly as possible to keep the blight from spreading to other tomato plants. You need to remove any plant debris and any dropped fruit as well. The pathogen can persist as long as there is any host tissue remaining. Bag or burn the infected plant material. Don't compost it.According to several ag bulletins, tomato blight has been reported in several counties, including Lancaster, which is near York. I recommend you take a sample of a diseased stem and leaves to your local Penn State Extension and have it analysed by the plant clinic. That way you'll know for sure exactly what blight you have and how to treat it. Here is a link to a Penn State publication on serious diseases of tomato.

  - Hi, This is likely a condition called green shoulders. It may be varietal (meaning some varieties of tomatoes show this trait more than others). It may also be due to potassium deficiencies (the availability of potassium may be affected by your watering techniques) and sometimes due to too high temperatures and perhaps viruses or other factors. Scientists are not 100 % sure what caused this disorder. So the best you can do it to water and fertilize regularly and if it really is too hot some days, perhaps the tomatoes can be moved to a shady spot during the hottest part of the day. You can also contact your local URI Garden Hotline for more information: http://web.uri.edu/mastergardener/gardening-hotline/

Tomatoes do not like weed competition, a straw or grass clipping mulch will help keep the soil evenly moist and control weed growth. The yellowing of the bean leaves is indicative of mite damage, their population can quickly flourish during hot, dry weather.http://ento.psu.edu/extension/factsheets/beans-insect-identificationro

  - There are no easy answers when it comes to protecting your plants from wildlife damage. Here are some suggestions: Pick your tomatoes before they are completely ripe (at the blush stage) and let them ripen on your kitchen counter. Cover the plants with floating row cover or bags. Provide water nearby and the chipmunks might go for the water and leave your tomatoes alone. You can use 1/4" fine mesh hardware cloth to exclude them from the garden or individual plants. Just be aware that these critters are persistent and may still find a way in and building a cage around each plant will make it hard for you to harvest, too.mh

  - Thank you for your question. Early blight is one of the most common tomato diseases. To prevent it, you should purchase seeds or plants resistant to blight. Do not  plant tomatoes or related crops like potatoes in the same place for at least two years. Avoid overhead irrigation or sprinkler systems  which create a humid environment favorable for the disease.  Mulch your plants to help keep leaves dry. Stake them to improve air circulation. Fertilize properly: do not over-fertilize with potassium; maintain adequate levels of both nitrogen and phosphorus. If your plant becomes infected remove and discard infected leaves as you see them.     In the fall remove or bury infected plants. Use fungicides when  appropriate, but timing is important and you should follow the label instructions carefully.  Call your local Extension Office for information about appropriate fungicides. Please let me  know if you need any additional information or have any questions.

## 66953_Minnesota

  - There are several tomato diseases where leaves are affected and turn brown. Septoria leaf spot has spots with tan centers, which appear on the lowest leaves and move upward. The leaves turn yellow then brown then die. Both early blight and late blight are fungal problems that begin with target-like spots on the lower leaves. These dark spots usually spread and run together. Pick off any spotted and diseased leaves immediately and destroy them. Do not put them in your compost pile if you have one. Its important to avoid getting the leaves of tomato plants wet. Also, the location of tomato plants need to be rotated. Do not grow the same crop in the same spot for at least three years.    Another possibility to your tomato problem is a nutrient deficiency, which can only be properly determined by a soil test. You can submit a soil sample to the Extension; here is a link to the form: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yardgarden/soils/docs/lawngardensoilsampleinformationsheet20131.pdf   Ripe tomatoes should be harvested promptly and not left to sit on the vine. Tomatoes have volatile aromatic compounds, so if they are left sitting out in the sun they can begin to lose flavor quickly. You may want to try bringing them in earlier. Bring the tomatoes in when they are half colored up and allow them to finish ripening on their own, which may increase the flavor. Dont put them in a sunny windowsill, as this will defeat the purpose. Tomatoes should never be kept in the refrigerator.

  - Beefsteak tomatoes can get powdery mildew, but being late in the season it rarely reduces production or causes harm. Be sure to rotate your tomato crop so that youdo not plant them in the same area for 3-years and water the soil, not the leaves. Also be sure to leave adequate space between plants for better air circulation. The pepper plants look like they might be subject to snails, slugs, pillbugsor earwigs. The damage may be minor and not affect production, so I suggest doing nothing or use a product containing iron phosphate and spinosad, such as Sluggo Plus.  Thanks for using Ask an Expert.

  - As you are discovering, gardening is a continual learning experience. Do not despair, you are in good company.Tomatoes. Your tomato plants are suffering from a very common fungal disease commonly known as 'early blight'.  It is important that you remove affected leaves as soon as you observe them. The dark spots surrounded by yellowing are spores, and they will spread to other parts of the plant when it rains or if you water from above. Review the following publication: http://extension.umd.edu/growit/early-blight-vegetablesStrawberries. The following page from our website should be helpful:http://extension.umd.edu/growit/fruit-profiles/strawberriesAs for your eggplant: Two things. Your plant is very healthy, but perhaps too healthy. Over fertilization, especially nitrogen fertilizer will result in excess foliage and little fruit production. http://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetable-profiles-eggplant Generally, nitrogen promotes healthy foliage, phosphorus encourages root, flower, and fruit production, and potassium encourages overall plant health.There are two times that fertilization is important, at the time of planting and again a light side dressing when the flowers begin to form. You might also consider using a 5-10-5 fertilizer.Be sure to use our website: http://extension.umd.edu/growitLS

## 67058_Colorado

  - Huge plants could indicate that too much nitrogen fertilizer was given to your tomato plants.  Other indicators of excess nitrogen would be: large leaves that are very dark green. Often, tomato plants given excessive amounts of nitrogen fertilizer flower and set fruit poorly.   Many fruiting crops (tomato, pepper, squash, etc) bear poorly when given excess nitrogen fertilizer.   Another possibility is that this season has been pretty hot.  Tomatoes may not pollinate well and may not set fruit well during very hot weather. See also: http://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/garden/02949.pdf

  - There are two diseases that cause spotting on tomatoes, though I would expect to see it on the leaves as well as the fruit. One is bacterial speck and the other is bacterial spot. There is really nothing you can do except to keep the tomato bed clean of plant debris and dropped fruit. If bacterial spec is the problem, the disease was in the plant when you bought it. Check the leaves for any evidence of spot and then I recommend you take samples to your local Penn State Extension so they can be sent to the plant clinic for analysis. There is no warning against eating the fruit, and your tomatoes look good to me. Here is a link to your extension office.

I know with the hot temperatures and a really bad hail storm my tomato plants have been a bit behind this year but are now starting to fruit. When the temperatures are very hot for a prolonged period of time, the pollen may become unviable, but cooler temperatures are (hopefully) around the corner. If they are flowering then there is still a chance for fruit. Keep them well watered and try an all purpose vegetable fertilizer every couple of weeks to help them along.Best of luck

  - Tomatoes varieties vary tremendously, from a fraction of an ounce to over a pound.  So it could be this is a common size for the variety. Many other factors can affect the size like moisture, fertility, weather, etc. Too many fruits can also cause fruit to be small. The rotting bottoms are most likely blossom end rot which is a result of a calcium deficiency although available calcium is not usually the cause but the inability of the plant to uptake enough calcium to keep up with the growth of the fruit. This can be caused by uneven watering or rapid growth.

  - Hello, First look at the variety of tomato you have, what is the number of days to maturity for each variety planted. Some varieties are very long season, so ripening fruit won't start until late in the season. The second problem this year has been the warm temperatures. Excessive heat will keep the tomatoes from setting on and it will also keep them from ripening.

## 67444_Minnesota

## 67452_Maryland
* askextension_tomato/67452_Maryland
  - From your description this does not sound like a disease. Animals such as turtles, squirrels, birds, groundhogs, etc. can be attracted to the fruit. Wildlife tend to feed more heavily on vegetable crops during dry seasons when little water is available. Do not let the fruit lay on the ground where it may be easy to reach. Pick the fruit at the blush stage and let the tomatoes ripen on your countertop. Consider putting out a container of water for the wildlife. Also, you can sprinkle the tomatoes with ground limestone and the critter may avoid them. There are no easy answers for controlling wildlife in an edible garden.If the issue aregroundhogs, you will have to consider fencing. Birds and squirrels - try covering the plants with a shade cloth temporarily to discourage them.mh

Do not spray any pesticides in high temperatures as it can cause further leaf damage. Pull up badly damaged plants. Keep weeds suppressed as they overwinter in nearby weeds. http://extension.umd.edu/growit/insects/spider-miteNext year you will have to monitor for the mites and follow above information for control. You can also purchase predatory mites and release them into your garden to control pest mites. The mites have to be present or the predatory mites will starve.

  - Thank you for the question. Tomato plant leaves can turn yellow and dropfor a variety of reasons and it's very hard to keep plants healthy until the growing season is over. Sometimes I feel like it's a race during the growing season to keep the tomato plants healthy enough to harvest an acceptable amount of fruit before frost! One thing to check is the type of tomato you are growing. There are determinate and indeterminate tomatoes. Determinate plants are generally shorter and tend to produce their crop of tomatoes all at once vs. indeterminate varieties that continue to grow all season, producing new tomatoes until fall. So, you could have a determinate variety that has stopped growing and won't produce anymore tomatoes this season.

  - It does look like you plants are suffering from tomato spotted wilt.  The virus is transmitted by the feeding if tiny insects called thrips.  The virus may persist in weed populations or be brought in via seedlings from the nursery.    Generally control of the virus is not practical.  Planting resistant varieties is normally the best option.More information can be found here: http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/r7831and here:http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/recognizing-tomato-problems-2-949/A list of resistant varieties can be found here:http://www.aces.edu/dept/com_veg/tswv.pdfIts not late to plant cool season vegetables.

If you want to try, knowing that they may not produce before frost here is what I would suggest:Option 1: Leave the plants in place and make sure you have sprayed for spider mites with and insecticidal soap spray directed upward from beneath the plants. Fertilize them and water as needed to maintain moist soil.Option 2: Propagate the plants using simple layering. The following web site tells how: https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/plant-propagation-by-layering-instructions-for-the-home-gardenerWhen the new plants have rooted well (in a couple of weeks) cut the connection to the mother plant and remove the mother plants from the garden.Skip

  - Your plants are suffering from blight.  Some varieties are more prone than others to blight.  The disease is in the soil and there really isn't anything you can do to get rid of it  We recommend that you rotate your tomatoes to different locations.  Also, using mulch under the tomatoes to help prevent the soil from splashing up on the leaves, is helpful.  Any leaves that touch the ground should be cut off.Here is some information on blight: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/fruit-vegetable/plant-diseases/late-blight-tomato/

## 68232_Iowa
* askextension_tomato/68232_Iowa
  - The black moldy material in the tomato fruit may be a type of internal blossom end rot.  Blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency in the developing fruit. Wide fluctuations in soil moisture levels impair calcium uptake by the root system of the tomato plant. Excessive nitrogen fertilization may also contribute to blossom end rot.To reduce blossom end rot, try to maintain a consistent supply of water to the tomato plants.  Avoid frequent or heavy applications of fertilizer.

## 68263_Minnesota
* askextension_tomato/68263_Minnesota
  - It is difficult to diagnose the problem without photos, but here are descriptions of two possible diseases where you find spots on the fruit: 1. Anthracnose infections are visible only on ripe and over ripe tomatoes.  The fruit spots are sunken and round with mature fruit spots having a black center. There are no visible spots on leaves. Symptoms begin as small, depressed lesions that are circular in shape. Lesions enlarge and become more sunken. As the lesion develops, target-like rings appear. As the lesion matures, the center turns tan and small black fruiting bodies appear. If the weather is wet, salmon-colored spores can be observed on the lesion surface. Lesions can coalesce if infection becomes severe. It is not uncommon for secondary pathogens, particularly bacteria, to invade and quickly render the fruit more inedible than it already appears to be. For this reason, infected fruit does not have an appreciable storage life and should be discarded.   2. Bacterial canker can be difficult to diagnose based on symptoms alone. The fruit will get small (1/4 inch), creamy, white spots with tan or brown centers on fruit. The fruit surface may appear netted or marbled.   No tomato problem makes the fruit poisonous. In most cases, the affected part can simply be cut out and the tomato eaten although the quality of the fruit may be too poor for consumption.    Fruit cracking is a common problem on tomatoes. Fruit cracking is associated with wide fluctuations in soil moisture levels. A heavy rain or deep watering after a long, dry period results in rapid water uptake by the plant. The sudden uptake of water results in cracking of ripening fruit. Fruit cracking can be prevented by supplying the tomato plants with a consistent supply of moisture during the summer months.

  - I live in Carbon County and for us the tomato season has been late. Cold weather in the spring meant we got a late start. Then it got extremely hot and the tomatoes just sat there. It has been the same story with the rain. When it rained, it poured. I've noticed that the tomatoes at the farmer's market taste like water. Melons also seem like they never got sweet. I have four heirloom tomato plants that didn't get planted until mid June. They just started producing tomatoes last week, and the tomatoes taste a lot better than the tomatoes from the farmer's market. However, they are suffering from poor pollination. I have catfacing, a deformity of large tomatoes caused by environmental factors. I'm not sure what to tell you to do since the environmental conditions are unpredictable. You sound like a seasoned grower. One thing that made a big difference for me this season was raised beds. My beds are 30 inches high because my husband can't garden on the ground. However, even with the normal height of a foot, you have better control over the crop. Cornell University Extension recommends using a soil mix of 60% topsoil, 30% compost, 10% perlite or sand which is a pretty standard potting mix. You can do the beds in four by four plots and devote one bed to tomatoes. With raised beds, you can put hoops of PVC conduit over the bed and attach insect netting or a sun filter or even shelter against a downpour with a temporary plastic tarp. If you top prune and thin out the foliage, you can make sure the leaves don't stay wet after a rain. Finally, you can install soaker hoses and a good mulch like undyed wood chips to control moisture, For me, it's given me some measure of control over the environmental factors that are unpredictable. There are even thermal covers for late cold snaps.It seems like we will have to get used to wilder weather and some years when we can't bring in a good crop. You'll have to find an organic grower nearby who might have planted heirloom tomatoes.

  - Tomato or tobacco hornworm is major pest of tomato plants and if not controlled early they will feast on the plants consistently and if given a chance to grown and mature into a butterfly that will lay more eggs, you will have a greater number of hornworms.I suggest to begin scouting plants early and use a BT insecticide at the first sign of worm damage from the hornworm or the tomato fruit worm. BT insecticides include such products as Dipel and Thuricide. They are naturally occurring compounds that are used by organic growers are completely safe to use on vegetable crops.I am not familiar with lime being used as an insecticide. It may work on some insects, but primarily it is used as a soil additive to correct the soil pH and add calcium to the soil. It is important to obtain the right pH for plant growth which helps the plant pick up nutrients through their roots better.Hope this helps.Tommy Grandy

  - Hello,Small back spots on tomato skin can be caused by fungus or bacteria. Without seeing the tomato and spots, I cannot determine causal agent. The University of Minnesota has a great fact sheet with pictures of the most common causes of spots on tomatoes at the link below. It lists the environments that would cause the particular disease to occur.http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/fruitspots.htmlRegards,Carol Quish

  - Oh "deer"!  The answer is maybe. Plants have a remarkable ability to grow out of such damage.  A lot will depend on how much of the plant is remaining.  It also requires that the weather cooperates long enough to generate fruit.  Determinant varieties may be less likely to produce.  You may want to "thin" any new fruit to focus the now limited plant energy. Some fertilization may help; however, too much nitrogen may produce a lot of leaves but no fruit.  I hope this helps,

  - This sounds like anthracnose fruit rot.  It cannot be noticed on green fruits but becomes obvious on the ripe fruit. These start as small water soaked spots which enlarge and develop dark fungal structures in the center. The fungal centers expand to a quarter inch or so. The fungal structures overwinter in the soil    As with most fungi once they are seen it is too late to do anything this year. Here are as some practices that can prevent or at least minimize the problem for next year.    1.    All tomato refuse should be removed and discarded. It your composter is hot enough they can be composted but otherwise remove off the site.   2.    Rotate the crops next year.  Plant the tomatoes away from where peppers, eggplants and potatoes were grown in the past three years.  They all suffer the same problems.   3.    Grow the tomatoes in areas that are not moist, having full sun and lots of air flow.    4.    Water early in the morning to allow the plant to dry or with drip watering to keep the water off of the plant.     5.    Staking or caging the plants is a way to keep the plants off of the soil.   6.    Mulch the plants in the spring with 6 inches of leaf or straw mulch to keep the fungi in the soil from getting in contact with the fruit.    7.    Use a preventive fungicide before the fungus is evident. Be sure to read all of the directions and make sure the fungicide is safe for vegetables. Hope this helps. Tony

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to a number of diseases and this one appears to be one of the bacterial spot diseases. The general recommendation is to remove the infected fruit to prevent further spread. You may find that all, some, or a few of the tomatoes are infected, but often plants will continue to produce as long as environmental conditions are suitable. Plants showing severe infections should be removed completely.Thanks for the question.

  - I am glad you asked the questions. Regarding changing a recipe and the safety of the home canned product, no it is not safe to make the change in the recipe. Please use the resources listed on the OSU Extension Food Preservation Resource that is included to locate information as well as tested recipes. Also, information presented on www.thekitchen.com states the the roasted tomatoes cannot be home canned. They should be used or frozen for future use. Your canned strawberry jam (used tested recipe resource) could have foam at top. However, the fact that you could open the canned product with your fingernail means it did not vacuum seal correctly. Therefore, the product should be discarded and not eaten. Food safety is the number one factor in home food preservation. Please use canning resources with a copy-write date after 2009.

  - Tomato varieties have definitely gotten sweeter and milder flavor over the last several decades. The tomatoes you find in the store are bred to handle a lot of handling as the first priority and flavor as a second. Most folks a looking for that mild sweet flavor, not a tomato that can bite them back. Flavor is a product of genetics and environment. Some of the old heirloom varieties may be your best bet. Warmer weather may increase the flavor level, as well as denser leaf set on the plants. Really hot weather will cause the plants to set few if any tomatoes. Ideal temperatures are around 80 daytime and 55 nighttime. your daytime temperatures probably exceed that for a lot of the summerBonnie Plants tomato flavor page has more tips.California Extension has Heirloom Tomatoesand more

  - HiHow disappointing for you! How is the light where they are growing? These vegetables require a minimum of six hours of direct sunlight, and preferably more, to do well. Although you fertilized correctly (great you got a proper soil test done!), but how about the soil organic matter? Is the soil very sandy or very clayey? Plants generally do better if there is lots of humus (decayed plant matter mostly) in the soil. Have you used compost or other such amendment (manure, peat, seaweed etc.)? I guess the other variable would be watering. It has been a hot summer... how was your watering regime? A good soaking (about an inch) once a week is a good rule of thumb: if it comes from the sky... great... if not, then a good watering is needed. The tomatoes and peppers are in the same family and are self-pollinating, but the squash need insects to bring the pollen from the male to female flowers. That can be an issue where flowers don't produced fruit.Since you describe plants that are alive but just not thriving, these would be the areas I would check first. Better luck next year!

  - Dealing with fungal diseases like early blight can be difficult . Spores can overwinter in the soil, plant debris, seed and transplants, and also blow in from other gardens. We recommend removing all plant residue from the containers. Planting fava beans, a cover crop, or garlic will do nothing for the disease and Garlic is not a good crop for containers.  Add compost this fall and in the spring. You can cover the bare soil with shredded leaves. If need be you can apply an organic fungicide early in the season when symptoms appear to lessen the spread of the disease. See our website for more information on early blight http://extension.umd.edu/growit/early-blight-vegetablesmh

  - We've been getting several questions about tomatoes and peppers that don't ripen. The problem is the erratic weather. Tomatoes like a steady heat, and our weather has hot spells that are really too hot followed by cool weather. Then the rain has been coming in spurts with downpours followed by drought. Luckily, tomatoes don't have to ripen on the vine. Since a tomato has everything it needs to ripen by the time it is full grown, I bring mine inside when I see that first blush of color. That way I avoid a world of problems with predators. You don't need a sunny window or anything special. If you want the tomatoes to ripen fast, you can put them in a cardboard box where the gasses that cause ripening will stay inside with the tomatoes. In my case, I just leave them on a counter that I don't routinely use. Some ripen in days and some take several weeks, but they all eventually ripe.As long as your vines are producing, leave the juvenile fruit on the vine and bring in the tomatoes that have reached full size. This will ensure that if we have a cold snap, your crop won't be affected.

  - Are you really meaning Late Blight, Early Blight or Septoria Leaf Spot? All have different symptoms. Tomato blight is not a disease. If it is leaves falling off from the bottom of the plant and having small brown spots, then turning yellow and then getting brown and crunchy and falling off, this is Septoria.  Plants do not have fungal diseases when you purchase them. Some come from fungus floatingin humid air, some are spread from plants in the same family around them and some remain in the soil from the last diseased tomatoes that were present.

## 70056_Minnesota

  - It is getting to the end of the season. The time of ripening depends on the variety of plant. Some are early and have ripe tomatoes all at once around the end of July. Those are determinate varieties. Indeterminate varieties start around the same time but the season is spread out with a few ripe at a time.They are winding down now.Then there are some that need an exceptionally long growing season of 85-90 days and are just starting to ripen now. You will rarely find the last type at farmer's markets because if there is an early frost, the crop is lost.

  - We are sorry to hear of your frustration, and truly hope that you will continue growing next year. There are varied ways to manage difficulties with tomato crops and while most of us struggle with blight regularly, it is possible to continue growing adecentcrop.The very first thing we'd suggest is to contact us DURING the growing season so we can assess what is going on and help you as early as possible. We can accept digital photos through these messages, and that often helps.Right now, sanitation is your first chore. Clean up all plant residues completely and get them out of the yard. (no composting).As for your questions: yes, you can grow whatever you want there next year.As far as your tomato cages go, the real problems come with the heavy growth of the plant within the cage. If the plant is not pruned or pinched, the leaves don't get good airflow to dry off, so disease pathogens are more likely to take hold. As you know, in all disease situations, it's best to keep the leaves as dry as possible. You may consider using stakes to hold/tie up the plants, and pinch out excess suckers and growth. You should also consider spacing your plants further apart for the same reasons. We are finding that keeping much of the lower plant denuded of leaves is a very useful practice as well. We are not sure which 'organic spray' you used, but a copper fungicide is what is most helpful, and be sure to follow label instructions, paying special attention to temperature and humidity ranges suggested.As far as cover crops go, they are a great idea, and now is the time to plant them.Here is our page about them: http://extension.umd.edu/growit/beyond-basics/cover-crops-protect-and-improve-your-soilcm

  - If you allow the blighted tomato plants to dry out in your garden, the spores will fall off into the soil. Burning does kill spores, however.

If the plants are showing signs of wilt, it's more than likely they were damaged by frost. The tomatoes you pick will ripen, if stored in a cool area, and gently packed in newspaper. Fruit put into the fridge will not ripen. You can also allow to ripen on the counter.When you covered the plants, were the coverings to the ground to trap heat from the earth?Do not can the tomatoes, as the acidity level will change...you can freeze them or eat fresh.

  - The fungus sounds like powdery mildew. That does show up when air circulation is poor. You need to remove all traces of your plants including dropped leaves this fall. Put the diseased plants in the garbage, not compost pile. Your plants next year need to be fair enough apart and have enough sun to prevent the mildew again. Also, put down a mulch of some sort under your plants to prevent soil from splashing up on the leaves. There will be disease in the soil. Remove any leaves that touch the ground.

  - Our cool night time temperatures can severely slow ripening of tomatoes.  As soon as tomatoes start to blush this time of the year you should remove them and ripen them inside at room temperature. This allows the energy of the plant to be concentrated on other fruits not yet mature size. Fortunately, we are having some late summer heat during the day. More of your tomatoes will begin to ripen if you remove flowers, suckers, dying leaves, small green fruits that have no chance of maturing, and those that have started to ripen from the vines. If you have not already done so severely reduce or quit watering your plants. This stresses the plant and causes the fruits to begin maturing. If there is a freeze predicted, you should remove all fruit still on the vine and bring them inside. Some will fully ripen, some will not depending on how mature they are when picked. Our temperatures are not quite there right now but it is getting down into the 40s in some areas so watch for predicted cold snaps. Row cover to protect the vines from cool temperatures at night will also help.

  - Tomatoes aren't "done" in the Twin Cities area but the harvest season is past peak for most varieties.  Green fruits will continue to ripen on the vine until frost, albeit more slowly than earlier in the season.  However, many growers get the best results by harvesting tomatoes when they begin to change color and ripen them indoors. Doing that limits the effects late season pests, diseases and cold weather.Recent nights have been cool, but not cool enough to significantly damage the fruit or plants and it isn't necessary to cover the plants until frost threatens.  The following information was prepared for Colorado residents, but most of it also applies to Minnesota.http://www.colostate.edu/Dept/CoopExt/4dmg/VegFruit/ripening.htm

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to several fungal diseases and the most common is early blight. See our website for more information on prevention and control. You can also select resistant varieties next year. See the resistant list from Cornell http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Tables/TomatoTable.htmlhttp://extension.umd.edu/growit/early-blight-vegetablesAt this point it is recommended to test your soil for pH and nutrient deficiencies if this has not been done in the last several years. See our link http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/soils/soil-testing  Be sure to discard badly-diseased plants and fruits; dont till them back into the soil. All other plant waste can be composted or directly incorporated into your garden soil. This will reduce the potential for these disease problems from next years garden. This debris should be bagged and put out for the trash and not put in the compost pile. Only really hot compost piles will kill off potential problems. Lettuce, spinach, and arugula can be planted through mid October. Cover these late plantings with a cold frame, temporary greenhouse or floating row cover. Be sure to fertilize seedbeds, keep the soil moist and protect seedlings from pests. Garlic and shallots can be planted mid October-mid November.If you decide not to plant, Do not leave the soil bare. Cover crops are preferred. If this is the first time planting or you want to plant early spring vegetables, look at spring oats. Oats are killed by the first hard freeze, leaving a brown decomposing mat in the spring.http://extension.umd.edu/growit/beyond-basics/cover-crops-protect-and-improve-your-soil Otherwise shredded leaves are a good alternative. Rake leaves into a loose pile and go over them with a lawnmower to cut them up. They will be much less likely to blow away if they are broken up. They can be worked into the soil next spring or seedlings can be planted through them. The mulch will act as a weed inhibitor.mh

At 5000 ft our water boils at over 200 degrees still, so you should be able to get to 190 just fine. Additionally, at this point in the recipe this boiling point is part of the cooking phase not the canning phase so it is creating the quality of the juice and is not necessarily a food safety concern. With that being said, remember to adjust your processing time in the canning phase according to your elevation to properly kill any germs and prevent botulism.If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

  - Sorry your tomatoes aren't ripening. Let's see if we can explain it. Cornell University weighs in for people disappointed by green tomatoes. "It takes six to eight weeks from the time of pollination until tomato fruit reach full maturity. The length of time depends on the variety grown and, of course, the weather conditions.  Theoptimum temperature for ripening tomatoes is 70 to 75F. When temperatures exceed 85 to 90 F, the ripening process slows significantly or even stops. At these temperatures, lycopene and carotene, pigments responsible for giving the fruit their typical orange to red appearance cannot be produced. As a result, the fruit can stay in a mature green phase for quite some time." They go on to say that light and soil fertility do not influence ripening, at this time. They also have suggestions for ripening the tomatoes, once they have begun to change color. For the full article, click here. Happy harvest to both you and your mother-in-law.

  - What you are describing sounds like sunscald.  Areas exposed to direct sunlight turn white with a "corky" texture inside. The rest of the tomato is perfect. I had it on several varieties this year too, and think it has to do with our weather. We had cool weather punctuated with very hot weather, so areas on the tomato got much hotter than the protected areas.   Fertilizing the tomato well so there is a good canopy of leaves will protect the fruit from sunscald.  Insects that defoliate the plant can also lead to sunscald. This article, Sunscald on Tomatoes has pictures of this condition and suggestions for prevention.

  - Many problems found in the vegetable garden are a result of growing conditions rather than insects or disease.  I suspect that the brown lines could be a result of inconsistent watering practices and variable temperatures.  The stem tissues can break when watered too much and then the tissue repairs itself which is the brown lines that you see. Ideally, the soil should remain consistently moist below the surface and never dry out completely or remain soggy.  This can be a challenge faced with changing weather. Take a look at this website which may help with other issues you may have with tomatoes.http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/recognizing-tomato-problems-2-949/

  - What a good question!Generally foods are best quality for the first year or 2 they are canned. If they are stored somewhere, cool, dark, dry, they will stay good quality longer than if stored somewhere with fluctuating or warm temperatures. However, how well are your frozen products packaged? If they are not extremely well packaged and sealed, they could dry out or take on flavors from other frozen foods during the next 6 months - year in the freezer. A manual-defrost freezer will keep them in better condition, longer. If you have a frost-free freezer, the quality deterioration is faster. So there are several variables. The final decision would depend on storage conditions and packaging. Sorry to not have one good answer.

Unfortunately, the attached images dont reveal any obvious defect.   I wonder if the darkened stem scar might be normal. For example, I currently have some tomatoes on the counter, most with intact stems and one where the stem came off when it was harvested. The stem scar on the latter is slightly darker than the others with a freshly removed stem.   The fruit can be examined at the Washington County Extension Service office, weekdays.

  - Before adding anything, get a soil test. It's the best way to understand your soil and will give you the best starting point. Soil tests provide a host of information such as organic matter content, pH level, nutrients available to the plant, what the soil is lacking, etc. It is wise to know where these levels are before taking any course of action.        Yes, adequate phosphorus is one of many nutrients vital for plant growth. It enables a plant to store and transfer energy, and promotes root, flower and fruit development. However, applying phosphorus when it is not needed creates a host of other problems.        With annual applications of organic material, phosphorus levels should likely be adequate. IF phosphorus is deficient, it is most likely to occur in new gardens where the organic matter content is low (less than 5% organic matter) and in soils with a high pH (7.8 to 8.3).

  - Your symptoms described sound like Septoria leaf spot, a very common fungal disease that starts on bottom leaves and works its way up the plant. This fungus defoliates the plant but fruit appears untouched by the fungus. If you have leaf spotting and the fruit is getting small raised spots (1/16 inch) this could be bacterial speck. There is also a bacterial spot that causes much larger spots on the fruit but these are sunken. Septoria is much more common problem. A few tips that may help. Remove all diseased garden debris to prevent overwintering of diseases. Make sure plants are spaced to allow air circulation between them. Be sure to remove weeds such as nightshade that are related to tomatoes which can also be a source for diseases that can damage the tomato crop.  Identification is the key here. Does the fruit get any spots if not that would likely point to Septoria. A very good article on septoria can be found at: http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato.aspx  If you are seeing fruit with small raised spots which occurs with bacterial speck or larger sunken spots that could be caused by bacterial spot these are not easily controlled other than by removing "all" infected debris and rotating site. Any left over debris once broken down should not be a source for these bacterial diseases. Check out this site from Cornell for symptoms of bacterial disease and get back with us on whether the symptoms fit Septoria fungal leaf spot or the bacterial diseases. http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Bacterial.htm#Click

  - I would be concerned about your recipe and method of processing. I am not aware of a research based recipe (tested in a laboratory) for home canning tomato soup or any other soup for that matter that has flour and butter in it. In fact they warn against any thickening including rice, noodles etc. This changes the density of the product so heat cannot penetrate as easily often resulting in under processing.When you say you processed using a steam canning do you mean processing in a steam canner. This method is only recommended for high acid foods. Since you added onions and celery in quite large quantities it would raise the pH and result in a low acid food that must be processed in a presssure canner to be safe. For your safety I would not recommend eating your soup. Botulism could be a possibility. There is a research based spicy tomato soup recipe in the latest edition of the Ball Blue Book that is research based. Also you might like to go to the OSU Food Preservation website and download Canning Soups for additional guidelines. The website is http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/food-preservation.For home canned tomato soup you can can a seasoned tomato sauce and use it as a base for making your soup, adding the butter and flour when you make it.

  - Thank you for your question.This is a good time of year to clean tomato cages, tools, stakes, etc. with alcohol. Alcohol works better on metal materials and tools because it doesn't rust the tools. Containers (plastic, ceramic) can be cleaned with a 10% bleach solution (10% bleach to 90% water). Next spring, use fresh, new potting soil when you plant. Do not reuse soil as soil-borne pathogens that cause tomato diseases can overwinter in soil. Here is a very extensive list of tomato varieties and their resistance / non-resistance to various diseases and physiological disorders from Cornell University vegMD.We also have a number of tomato Extension publications here: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/#tomatoesNote that "resistant" does not mean completely immune. Resistant means the variety can tolerate and fend off disease better than others, but still may exhibit some signs and symptoms in years of particularly good conditions for the disease.There are also recommendations in the above Extension publications for cultural control and sanitation practices (such as watering at the base of the plant and not overhead) that can help reduce the occurrence of tomato diseases. These are often recommended as best practices for all types gardening.As to where to purchase resistant varieties, I can only recommend looking at and talking to local garden centers, farmers' markets and online for plants. Always purchase healthy plants free of leaf spots and damage from a reputable grower. Plant labels should list plant resistance using codes such as V (resistant to verticillium wilt), TMV (resistant to tobacco mosaic virus), etc.

  - Thank you for your question. Most tomatoes being propagated and sold by seed are promoted as being high in lycopene, but I have never seen tomato or potato varieties as being promoted as low in potassium probably due to a limited market and the fact most people are growing these plants for their high nutrient value including potassium. This is a good question to ask specific growers and breeders of these foods. Maybe try contacting seed companies like Seeds of Change or Baker Creek who have direct communication with seed producers and produce a very wide variety of these foods. However, to my knowledge, it isn't an area of research here at the U of MN in Horticultural Science.

## 74094_Minnesota

  - Thank you for the question. With the abundant rainfall this year, many people experienced splitting of their tomatoes. The most common cause of splitting in tomatoes is environmental stress. As the tomatoes mature the skins get harder. If the plant gets a lot of water after that point, either through rainfall or irrigation, it will take water into the fruit causing it to swell and split the skin. You might want to harvest these tomatoes a bit early and let them ripen off the vine. That way, the plant cannot add more water. When it doesn't rain so much and you have more control, avoid daily watering. Try watering every three to four days, picking the tomatoes just before you water. When possible, harvest tomatoes if you expect a heavy rain.Here's what the University of Minnesota says about it:http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/disorders-of-tomato/Thank you for contacting Extension.

## 74096_Colorado

  - Land-Grant Universities across the US do not conduct vegetable variety trials as much as was once done - so very new varieties may not be trialed. Colorado is a big state with lots of differences in soils, climate, topography, etc.  So a tomato variety that grows well in Grand Junction may not grow and produce well in Evergreen. With these caveats, here are some older "tried and true" varieties that generally do well in the Denver metro area: Cherry-type tomatoes:  Cupid hybrid, Sugary, SuperSweet 100, Sun Sugar, SunGold. Larger tomatoes determinate growth habit:  Bush Champion, Celebrity (semi-determinate), Roma, Super Bush.

  - It is late to trim trees and shrubs. The next best time to do this is around March into early spring for trees and shrubs that do not bloom on new growth. I have placed a link below with information on pruning.  When using pots to grow vegetables it is recommended you change soil out every year. It looses nutrients in such a small growing space and easily carries any disease that may be present.

  - It depends on how the tomatoes were packed. Generally there are 4 different styles of pack. See our free publication, Canning Tomatoes and Tomato Products, PNW 300, http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/sites/default/files/documents/pnw_300_canningtomatoesandtomatop... , pages 9-11 to identify the style you like and then check the processing time for that style. You have the option of water bath or pressure canning. In either method, you will need to add bottled lemon juice or citric acid, see pages 4-5 for more information and the amounts to help prevent botulism poisoning. Tomatoes from frost killed vines are not recommended for canning because the pH changes too much - the processing times listed are not long enough and the acid is not high enough to prevent botulism and produce a good quality product.

## 74871_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/74871_Oregon
  - Its true that blossom end rot (BER) in tomatoes is caused by a calcium shortage but the underlying problem is too little water to transport the calcium to the far end of the tomato. Thus, erratic watering is the culprit; the soil is first moist but, then, dries too much before more water is added. Then, too, the unusually high temperatures this year took many gardeners by surprise, drying out garden beds and containers faster than normal. Another glitch is that some kinds of tomatoes are more sensitive to BER than others, among them Roma.    Epsom salt wont help because it doesnt contain calcium. I dont know what you added for calcium but, if you tried eggshells, they dont work either. In a garden or raised bed, add lime every 2nd to 3rd year, the amount according to the label. See "Blossom-End Rot of Tomatoes https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/fs139.pdf.   Even though you are unable to rotate crops, its helpful to mix in at least 2 inches of compost each time you plant. Also, consider using large pots every now and then.  If you have a disease problem, either skip growing tomatoes for several years or use large containers. Depending upon the kind of tomato, a 5- or 10-gallon pot is suitable. See Grow Your Own Tomatoes and Tomatillos https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/ec1333.pdf and Container Grown Tomatoes http://extension.psu.edu/plants/gardening/fact-sheets/vegetable-gardening/growing-great-container-vegetables/tomatoes.

  - Keeping tomato diseases in check is a common problem for many tomato growers. Solarizing the soil is a positive step. Here are some other steps you can take to help keep your plants healthy.   Inspect plants regularly.  Diseases, if caught early, can be slowed if not stopped.  Look for insects that could vector diseases.   Sanitation is an important factor for soil born diseases.  Make sure you clean up plant debris in the fall to reduce conditions conducive to disease survival. Burn or dispose of diseased materials (Do not compost). If you start your own plants indoors be sure to sanitize any pots/trays that have been used before.  Keep weeds down(especially solanaceous weeds like night shade.) Using plastic mulch with drip irrigation can help prevent pathogens splashing up on lower leaves as well as keeping the foliage dry. The mulch will also help with weed control. Keep your pruners sanitized, They can easily spread diseases.   Handle plants only when dry. It is very easy to spread diseases when plants are wet.   Anticipate diseases.  Routine treatment with fungicides (organic and  inorganic) works!  They work much better as a preventative.   Resistant varieties can help.  Plant different varieties since some respond differently to certain pathogens.  This can help assure you will get some survivors.   Keep plants healthy.

  - HelloThe seeds from hybrid tomatoes do not grow true-to-type. They are first generation (F1) hybrids.Heirloom varieties should breed true-to-type if they are not cross-pollinated. But since you mixed the hybrid and heirloom, it is likely that the heirloom seeds will not be true-to-type either. Heirloom varieties typically breed true-to-type if they are not cross-pollinated, i.e. pollen needs to come from the same variety.

The black gumbo soil is rich in nutrients, which causes the black color but its also hard to get drainage?

  - There are a couple things that could be going on. Its possible that somewhere along the way a variety of tomato with smaller fruits got mislabeled. This happens sometimes in the trade. Its also could be due to low levels of a nitrogen. This could due to the nature of the soil used. For example, it could have a high carbon to nitrogen ratio (lots of wood products) or it just may not have contained much plant available nitrogen to begin with. If you fertilized the plants with nitrogen you can probable rule thisout.It is worth noting that many people struggled with tomatoes thisyear. There were frequent reports of slower than normal ripening which might be attributed to the weather or perhaps pest issues (mainly the tomato psyllid).In terms of soil amendments, for the first few years in a new garden we recommend 1" (3 yards per 1000 sq ft)of manure based compost or 2-3" (6 to 9 years per 1000 sq ft)of plant based compost be added each year and tilled in 6 inches or deeper.

  - I certainly do not know the nutrients contained in Dutch Master Gold One Flower nutrient at the standard dosage but can give some suggestions. The Yellow shoulders disorder can be eliminated through a close nutritional program monitoring. Have you done any plant tissue tests on your tomatoes? Some cultivars are more susceptible than others. Be sure that yours is not one of those cultivars. What is the pH of your nutrient solution? Make sure it is not above 6.8. Does the nurtrient solution contain excess magnesium in relation to calcium? Are the growth temperatures adequate? Temperatures &gt;90F are a predisposing factor to Yellow shoulders.    You have rightly pointed it out, insufficient exchangeable K+ triggers this disorder. Increase K+ to over 3%by dry matter depending on your tissue test results and do not wait until late to adjust K+ status of nutrient solution and pH. You could apply Potassium, Calcium or magnesium salts (Potassium Nitrate, Sulfate of Potash, Potassium Carbonate, Calcium Nitrate, Calcium Chelate, and Magnesium Oxide).

  - Most potato and tomato varieties are susceptible to early blight. The following list of tomato varieties suggest some level of tolerance/resistance: Iron Lady, Mtn. Supreme, Mtn. Magic, Defiant PhR, Jasper, Juliet, and Verona. For potato, choose later maturing varieties as they tend to be less susceptible. Ensure proper nutrition and irrigation to maintain foliar health later into the growing season. Higher nitrogen and potassium rates can help but care must be taken to avoid excess amounts which can delay tuber maturity. In addition, over irrigation can leach nitrogen out of the root zone which will increase plant stress and exacerbate early blight infection.

We do have a variety called 'Fourth of July' available in Missouri garden centers and at local greenhouses. It really does produce tomatoes around the 4th of July. It's one of the earliest varieties I've ever grown.Keep in mind, that most tomato plants are susceptible to fungal diseases such as Septoria Leaf Blight or Early Blight, so these plants your bring up from Texas won't necessarily be immune to disease we have here.

There are two types of tomatoes; determinate varieties that stop growing and bearing fruit at a certain point and remain shorter than indeterminate ones that continue to grow throughout the season, often becoming very large and producing fruit until the weather cools.

Cherry and grape varieties are likely to ripen earlier.  Here are some varieties recommended by Oregon State University for cool season climates.  http://extension.oregonstate.edu/lincoln/sites/default/files/RECOMMENDED_TOMATO_VARIETIES.pdfAlways choose the sunniest spot available to grow tomatoes. If you're growing in a greenhouse, almost any tomatoes should do well as long as you have good ventilation.

  - You and a lot of others have a difficult time growing tomatoes on the N. Oregon coast and I am right in there with you! Early Girl and Sweet 100's are two varieties that you may have success with. The rule of thumb is, the smaller the tomato the shorter the number ofdays to maturity. A short maturity is what you need to look at when selecting your plants. Your local nursery can help with your choices.You may also consider growing your tomatoes in containers or raised beds as the soil will warm up faster and you will not have to fight soil with heavy clay or toomuch sand. Yes, sheltering them or using a "wall of water" is a good idea too.Good luck and I hope you get to enjoy some home made salsa!

People usually lay them in a trench horizontally if the plants have become excessively tall. One advantage is that the soil is warmer in the top 4-6 inches so root growth will be quicker. Some gardeners dig 12-18 inch holes, amend the soil with compost, and plant their transplants with only the top leaves above the soil line.

  - Hi,  That's a good question, but since potato beetles will feed on tomato leaves (as well as other members of the nightshade family), I don't think the tomato/potato graft will solve your problem. See this info from the U: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/colorado-potato-beetles/ If you do try this, I'd be interested in hearing the results. I can't imagine you'd have a very good yield of either potatoes or tomatoes, but I guess stranger things have happened!

  - Go here to learn how to keep flea beetles away from tomato plants:http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/flea-beetles/Floating covers will exclude Japanese beetles as well as flea beetles but commonly available insecticides are less effective against Japanese beetles.http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/insects/find/japanese-beetles/Tomatoes grow best when they receive sufficient water on a consistent basis.  A fluctuating supply can lead to flower and fruit drop, sunscald and blossom end rot.The most critical stages for watering are at transplanting, flowering and fruit development.  The amount of water needed daily varies depending upon soil conditions, rainfall, wind and temperature.  The need for water increases as the plants grow.  Try to supply enough water and at the right time to prevent wilting.Go here for an introduction to growing tomatoes hydroponically.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B5boJcdm4S8https://cals.arizona.edu/hydroponictomatoes/

  - Yes, these should be thinned to one per cell.You can eitherjust snipthe extras off at the soil line, or gently break them apart andreplants the extras. We are still a good distance from when these can go out- roughly after Mother's Day so they will need repotting soon into a 4" pot.Here is our vegetable profile page for tomato: http://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetable-profiles-tomatoescm

  - Generally speaking, choose varieties that ripen early or mid-season (65-75 days to maturity). Cherry tomatoes are usually among the first to ripen.Consider:Early Girl (50 days), Bush Early Girl (54 days), Juliet (60 days), Celebrity (65 days), Husky Cherry Red (65 days), or Super Sweet 100 (65 days).Tomatoes with the best size and flavor often mature late (80 days or longer) but you may have success with them if they are planted in  containers in a warm, sheltered place such as next to a south facing wall.

  - Thank you for including images with your inquiry. Unfortunately, its difficult to determine the characteristics of the spots.  My best guess about the spots on the leaves in the first 2 pictures is that the spots are not infections and are likely to be unimportant.  The 3rd image reveals what appears to be an expanding lesion at the edge of the cotyledon (seed leaf) as well as a shriveled seed leaf (perhaps dried out?) on the adjacent seedling. The slight brown coloration on the white particles (perlite?) at the edge of the pots suggests the seedlings are short of water. (Water at the base of the seedlings, adding sufficient to drain out of the bottom; discard the drain water.)   It would be helpful if you could bring several of the affected seedlings to the office of the Multnomah County Master Gardeners to be inspected in person. The office is in Montgomery Park, 2701 NW Vaughn St. Suite 450, Portland, OR 97210. Hours are 10 AM to 2 PM, Monday through Friday, closed holidays.   The seedlings need more light.  A 4-foot long shoplight, with 2 fluorescent tubes (one cool white, the other warm white) suspended an inch or 2 above the seedlings.   The leaf purpling indicates the seedlings need fertilizer.  Use a liquid fertilizer, prepared at quarter- to half-strength, applied as needed.    See Seed Starting at https://extension.illinois.edu/hortihints/0402a.html

  - Thanks for your question about frost protection for your tomatoes. As you've undoubtedly noticed, the 'predicted' high and low temperatures for any given season are changing from year to year. So, indices like USDA zones, and historic temperatures just aren't as reliable as in 'the good old days.'But, we do the best we can. Here's a very thorough articleon the entire topic from Deschutes County extension. Suggestions for crop protection start on page 13, and include row covers, but there are some other suggestions.

  - Thanks for your question about your tomato problem. There are some facts that aren't included in your question that would help in figuring out the problem(s). Did you plant your tomato seeds in a sterile seed growing mix? (I can see white/gray dots on the surface of the soil, which I can't tell are perlite/vermiculite or mold fungus.) Have you kept the soil warm? What type of lights are you using? (Grow lamps are the only effective light source until it's warm enough to put them out under the sun.) Your seedlings look rather spindly, which implicates light intensity. Is there any chance you have whiteflies in your garage?Here's a linkto an article that discusses leaf curl. Herbicide damage seems unlikely, but either of the other two causes are plausible.Sorry I can't provide a definitive answer, but hope this article is helpful.

  - The following URLs will go a long way in answering your questions (and then some).  The one from Minnesota Extension is dated 2010.  Although good information, there are some tomato types good for containers that have been developed since then.  The Ohio State reference is from Jan 2017 so quite recent.  The Gardening Channel web site expands on what is in the other two.  To summarize, suggested types include both Roma and cherry, size and type of container depend on the tomato grown and if you intend to move it around.  A rule of thumb is to use the largest pot you can handle.  Even when a small pot works for some tomatoes, it requires frequent monitoring for water and nutritional needs. Tomatoes, as you probably know, are heavy feeders.  Use a high quality potting soil.  Garden soil may harbor diseases.  The Ohio State reference covers fertilization in depth.  There is potting soil available that contains a starting fertilizer.  Follow fertilizing directions on whatever product you use.  Too much nitrogen can produce a forest in your pot and very little fruit. Note that time to maturity is a factor with our short growing season. You want as many mature tomatoes as possible before our first frost. This data should be available to you when you purchase the plant/seeds. If you do plan to plant seeds, starting them inside under lights or where sun is bright is a good idea. End of May is a good time to put them out.One possible approach would be to find a tomato in these references you think you would like, check for availability and be open to new introductions at your local nursery.  Perhaps a cousin of one of the plants listed is available and improved.http://blog-yard-garden-news.extension.umn.edu/2010/07/tasty-tomatoes-in-containers.htmlhttp://www.gardeningchannel.com/growing-tomatoes-in-pots-best-varieties/http://ohioline.osu.edu/factsheet/HYG-1624Good luck with your tomatoes!

  - If temperatures are close to 50 degrees they can be taken outside and taken in at night. Tomatoes and basil require heat to develop and cold sets them back. A slight frost will kill them. The frost free day is May 15th. acclimate the plants to the sun by keeping them in the shade for about a week. They also must adjust to wind.http://www.tomatodirt.com/harden-off.html

  - This does not look like a disease issue and will not spread to your other plants. Looks like it may be nutritional in nature. If you are not growing under lights, consider for next season. Also, hold off starting your tomatoes seeds until the end of March/early April for next season. The beginning of March is too early. See our website for starting seedlings indoors. http://extension.umd.edu/growit/food-gardening-101/starting-vegetable-seeds-indoorsPick off any blooms. If you can, the plants may be better off in you can take them outside in a shaded spot during the day and bring in for the night. You will be doing this until you plant outdoors. Also, since you planted in early March, the plants may need a light fertilization with a soluble fertilizer. Make sure the containers have holes for good drainage. The plants should do okay once planted.mh

  - Thanks for your question about the taste of tomatoes. Unfortunately, university research about 'taste' is pretty non-existent, since it tends to be a subjective issue. However, horticulturists in California have done some testing, and the conclusion seems to be that over-watering may be the cause. Here's a linkto an article that indicates:"Watering has a major impact on tomato plant health and tomato fruit flavor. In an experiment by Master Gardeners of Santa Clara, California, the fruits of tomato plants watered twice each week grew large and turned out watery and flavorless. By contrast, the fruits from tomato plants watered once each week were flavorful, and many taste testers preferred the intense flavor of fruits from tomato plants that weren't watered at all after the fruits reached 1 1/2 inches in diameter, although those fruits developed thick skins."You can read the article; reference links are at the end of the piece.Hope this is helpful, and you'll have great tasting tomatoes this summer!

  - Unfortunately, we have no safe canning instructions for reprocessing a product that has already been canned once, nor for a recipe for Bloody Mary mix.  By not starting with a tested recipe, we dont have a way to determine a safe processing method (boiling water versus pressure canning) or time to process the jars.

  - Our vegetable specialist looked at your photo and is not concerned.He thinks that it may have been overwatered and saturated. Just pinch those leaves off. You should tip the plant out of the pot and look at the roots. They should be white and fleshy, not black or mushy.If the roots are circling the pot and it looks root bound, it's time to pot it in the next bigger pot size.It is still too early to plant it outdoors, so you will likely need to pot it up again before that time, which is in mid-May or so.cm

  - Tomato acidity varies by variety, growing conditions, and the level of ripeness at the time of harvest. We consulted a study from Utah State University Extension in which the acidity of 15 tomato varieties was tested and compared. Heirloom tomatoes were found to have a higher pH (meaning they were less acidic) compared to hybrid varieties. Among the varieties tested, Celebrity, Row Pack, and Rutgers were found to be the most acidic. In addition, Bonnie Plants noted that Purple Calabash and Long Keeper are two varieties that have an acid taste. The flavor ultimately will depend on the sugar to acid ratio. CKC

  - Seedlings/transplants can show different colors such as yellow or purple when under any type of stress. This can be environmental (wind, cool temperatures, water logged soils), nutrient issues, etc. We looked at your photos and this does not look like tobacco mosaic virus. Third photo - looks like the soil may be too wet. Water to keep the media moist, but not wet. Its ok if the surface of the growing media dries a bit. Pinch off any affected foliage. If your transplants are to be grown for more than 6 weeks you may need to fertilize lightly with a soluble fertilizer. Follow label directions for indoor plants or transplants. It is a little early to be hardening off your tomato plants/peppers. If you are planning to plant outdoors be prepared to provide protection. These plants will not take off until the temperature and soils warm about mid-May.

## 80014_Oregon

  - Thanks for your question about growing tomato starts. The probable cause of yellow leaves is a lack of nitrogen.  It looks as if you have them under a grow lamp (since sunlight--such as we've had it--isn't strong enough through a window.)Have you added fertilizer to the water regularly? Nitrogen is critical for photosynthesis, which creates the sugars for the plants to grow, but you can overwhelm the seedlings with too much nitrogen. As one source says:[K]eep an eye out for yellowing leaves, which indicate the need for food. If possible, wait until your seedlings have at least 2-3 sets of leaves before feeding. If you decide to give your plants some additional nutrients now, then feed seedlings with a weak (1/4 strength)water-soluble tomato fertilizer. Keep an eagle eye out for crystallized salts on soil surface. That will tell you youre feeding your seedlings too much. Here's a link to an OSU publication about tomatoes, which you might find helpful on your maiden voyage. Hope it helps. Good luck and bon appetit!

  - It would be a good idea to wait to purchase the plants as warm season plants like tomato and eggplant will not start to grow well until soil temperatures warm up which is about Mother's day or later mid May. In generalharden off your plants 1-2 weeks prior to setting out in your garden. See our website on hardening off for more tips. This should answer many of your questions. http://extension.umd.edu/growit/food-gardening-101/hardening-get-em-ready-great-outdoorsSow eggplant seeds about 8 weeks before your last frost date. The beginning of March is too early as the plants have to be held back possibly subject to poor light, improper temperature ranges, nutrient deficiencies, etc. These are all stresses that produce tall spindly plants that may show colors like yellow or purple. Transplant to a larger container if you have not done that and fertilize with a dilute liquid fertilizer. See our website for tips on growing vegetable transplants and seed starting http://extension.umd.edu/growit/food-gardening-101/starting-vegetable-seeds-indoorsIt is okay to keep the transplants plants in the shade if we get hot temperatures and on windy days. Transplants may be left outside overnight if the temperature will not fall below 50 F. If you plant too early, the plants will just sit there until soil temperatures warm up to about 60 degrees. Cool soils limit the uptake of plant nutrients. Water the transplants in with a balanced soluble fertilizer to help with early season nutrient stress. Protect with a floating row cover.

You may have more than one issue with your tomatoes, since the leaves (new leaves are curling and turning black), stems (turning black) and fruit (tomatoes are small) are all affected. The problem could be environmental, chemical, or biological. If your city has a plant clinic or a knowledgeable nursery, you can take samples of the plant to get a more definitive diagnosis.   Since your other plants are not affected, you may want to consider just removing the sick plant and being more diligent with your remaining crop.     I wish you the best!

  - Soil temperatures are just as important as air temperatures. Tomatoes and peppers like soil to be 70-75 degrees since they are basically tropical plants. You can use an insta-read thermometer to take readings in places you want to plant. If you do plant, you should buy row cover because we our frost date is May 15th, and we have had frosts as late as May 30th. My tomatoes are currently outside in 4" pots in a raised bed covered with a low tunnel made from PVC hoops and agrobond row cover that lets in light but keeps the temperature warm enough to prevent tissue damage. The tomatoes and peppers outgrew my indoor facilities, so I had to put them outside. Since I germinated them in an unheated garage, they were already able to tolerate somewhat lower temperatures, but it would kill them to plant them in the soil because it is still in the 60's in my garden.Once the tomatoes are planted in the garden, you should be prepared to cover them if there is a cold night in the forecast. Planting them early doesn't mean they will produce early. They will not be stimulated to grow and produce fruit until outdoor conditions trigger that condition in the plant.

  - You may have tiny slugs in your greenhouse that are eating the cotyledon leaves.  You would see stems contract and fall over with damping off (a common problem with seedlings) so I don't think that's your problem. Slugs are active mostly at night and like high humidity areas. You might try baiting with a pan of beer. If you find them there are a number of control methods, including copper strips around your plants, baits, etc depending on how extensive they are. This article, Slugs and Snails gives more information.   You also want to ensure that your plants get the best start possible. Tomatoes are warm-weather vegetables. Heating pads or cables under the seedling can be very helpful. They also need light. If there is not enough in your greenhouse, you can add supplemental light, fluorescent or LED. Once you see true leaves start fertilizing them with diluted fertilizer. This article, 10 Seed Starting Tips gives more tips. If you start your tomatoes again with the increase in temperature and light this time of the year, they will grow vigorously and catch up.

  - Well, with the weather we are presently experiencing, no annual plant would be safe in an outside frame.  I am assuming your patio floor is cement or patio blocks.  That is too cold, especially since no sun warms it.  It would have to be up off the floor insulated by warmer material like wood with soil on top.  Again, the lack of sun will mean the cold frame would not warm up very much.  I don't think it will be warm enough for heat loving plants like tomatoes.  You could consider purchasing a small upright greenhouse which could be put next to the house in the sun.

## 80362_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/80362_Colorado
  - Hello Chris,There are a few factors that come to mind when considering your tomato problems.Because your tomatoes have appeared to be weak looking and not producing as they have in the past, I'm wondering if the sunlight has changed in the last few years because of trees growing larger and blocking out the light. If this is the case, they would need to be relocated where they would receive a minimum of 7-8  hours of full sun for maximum fruit production.Every few years consider changing out the soil. Replace it with a good quality potting soil. Don't use regular garden soil that can be high in clay. If you want to amend the soil with organic matter (peat moss, compost or well rotted manure), use only enough to bring the organic content to 5-7%. Any more than that can be counter productive.In containers It's easier for the water to pass through and take nutrients with it. You will need to use a water soluble vegetable fertilizer more frequently to get good fruit production.Lastly, tomatoes need a fairly large planter box to accommodate their root system. Consider growing patio type tomatoes that have a smaller root system and require less rooting space.More information on tomatoes and container gardening below.

  - There is a naturally occurring verticillium wilt that comes from the soil. That is why we rotate tomatoes to a new location each year.

  - The optimum time to transplant tomato seedlings and plants in the Willamette Valley (according to Steve Solomon who authored "Growing Vegetables West of the Cascades") is from mid-May to mid-June, depending on the weather. We are still experiencing cold nights, so if you do plant them earlier, make sure you cloche (or use some protective covering during the night) the plants, if they have not been hardened off yet. You can plant early varieties like Early Girls for mid-summer harvests. We will be getting some unseasonably warm weather this week, so maybe it will be a good opportunity to put your tomatoes in a little early, but make sure they are protected from the cold nights for a while.

  - Good day. Honestly, I am not quite sure what is eating or damaging the tomatoes in that way. It is possible that the string is too tight and is allowing some damage to start. It is also possible there are mice or even birds pecking at them. They are not usually savable when they get significant stem damage. There is still time to replace any that are lost. You can also try loosely wrapping the bottom of the stems in foil to reduce damage on other plants. Don't do it tightly as that can trap moisture. oh, one other possibility is they got whipped around a lot by the winds we have had and that has cracked and damaged the stems. If the leaves are not wilting and the plants can be kept on the dryish side for a week or so, they may heal and grow through this, too. It does not look like disease or insects, really.

  - We had our vegetable specialist look at your photo. He does not think the symptoms are consistent with a disease. Is the plant indoors or outside? If it is indoors, we suggest that you plant it outside now and wait and see if the condition of the plant improves. Two months would be a long time for a tomato seedling inside, and seedlings in their starter pots for too long tendto suffer from limited light, overwatering, and/or poor nutrition. Typically tomato seedlings recover when they are planted out, their roots get established, and they can get more nutrition. We recommend planting in the top 8" of soil where it is the warmest.CKC

  - Yes your plants got sunburned. You have to be very careful when exposing plants to the sun. It needs to be done in very gradual doses. You should probably carefully repot them in larger pots with good potting soil. Let them have only morning sun for a week or so and some new leaves should develop. Then, as I said, gradually expose them to the sun. Don't let them bake in a greenhouse. It is fine for them to be in there evenings and early mornings but the greenhouse either needs to be completely open to air circulation or you need to take them out where the plastic doesn't hold the heat.

  - Thanks for your frost protection question.  Here is a linkto an answer an experienced Master Gardener gave about fall protection--but equally valuable in your area. I've attached a photo of one Seattle gardener's solution (albeit in the spring.) As Jean noted, though, don't let the plastic touch the plants. The thickness of the plastic is less important than the timing. Put it over the plants before the temperature gets to 30 degrees, and remove it in the morning after sunup. You certainly can purchase commercial products that say they can protect the plants, but cheap plastic works, too. Just weigh it down so it doesn't blow off overnight.Since you might have other questions about efficient and effective ways to garden in Central Oregon, here's a linkto a very thorough article from Deschutes County extension on many subjects.

  - There are many reasons why tomato plants turn yellow among them over-watering or under-watering, nitrogen deficiency, plant disease. From what you have written, I do not think that your problem is over or under watering. Tomato leaves also turn yellow at the bottom but not until the plant is tall and bushy. My first impression when you wrote this question was that there may be a nitrogen deficiency in the soil. Leaf mulch is great but it takes a very long time to break down to do any good. I would recommend that you get your soil tested through your local extension service. If it shows a deficiency then Nitrogen or Potassium is easy to get at your local plant store. My recommendation is that you get your soil tested first. If this does not fix your problem, please call us or email me back. I hope this helps..

  - These symptoms on the lower branches can result from several factors such as insufficient nutrients, cold injury, and/or overwatering. Yellow in the lower leaves can indicate low nitrogen. When young plants are first set out, it takes time for the roots to get established so they can take up adequate nutrition. Cool soil can impede nutrient uptake. Give the plant time to establish its roots. If the top growth of your tomato plant looks green and healthy, it will be fine. Here is a link to common causes of leaf yellowing in tomato transplants:https://extension.umd.edu/growit/leaf-yellowing-vegetable-seedlings-and-transplantsAlso, these are some common problems that occur in tomatoes and an explanation of the causes:https://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IP...The spots on the leaves might be a symptom of overwatering. Do the spots feel like raised bumps when you feel the surface of the leaf? If so, this might be edema, which is a condition caused when plants take up water faster than it can be used and transpired.https://extension.umd.edu/growit/edema-vegetablesTomatoes need about 1" of water per week. Becarefulthatyoudon't overwaterthem.We recommend that you prune off the yellowing lower leaves, reduce your watering, and monitor the plant over the next week or so. The symptoms you see are not uncommon in tomato transplants and typically the plants do just fine once they get their roots established and we have consistently warm weather.

  - Thanks for your question about growing tomatoes! Since we are affiliated with Oregon State University, and committed to giving advice that is research/evidence based, I can safely refer you to two publications of that definition. The firstis based on OSU Professor James Myers' research on specific varieties which excel in the Pacific Northwest, with recommendations on the best way to grow and harvest them. The secondis from the Clackamas County Master Gardeners' Ten Minute University information, which is 'vetted' by our OSU Extension Agent.I think these should provide you with the 'what' and the 'how' of tomato culture. Hope they're helpful. Good luck!

  - I don't know exactly what you call pruning. It is helpful to pinch out the tiny starts of new branches that form at the junction of a branch and stem to keep the plant to be less bushy. That is done sometimes with a young plant. After that the branches are allowed to grow. The leaves are not taking energy from the fruit but providing energy to the plant. Occasionally people prune out some branches late in the fall to let the sun in to ripen the late tomatoes. I never have had to do that. They seem to just ripen fine on their own. One housekeeping pruning is helpful to the health of the plant. Clip off branches as they grow and start to touch the ground. Clipping them off helps to keep the soil from splashing up and spreading disease.

  - Did you rotate the tomatoes and peppers to a new location? There is a soil disease called verticillium wilt that attacks members of the nightshade family. The first year it doesn't affect the plants, but each successive season it gets worse and the bacteria multiply.You can have the soil tested at Penn State and find out if there is a problem with the soil. Your local Penn State Extension has the kits and you can pick one up or ask them to send it to you through the mail.In the meantime, if it is possible to lift the plants and relocate them, I would do so. Don't take the soil with the plant. The other thing you can do is buy five gallon tomato grow bags. You fill the bags with a good soil mix, and the tomatoes grow in the bags. Since the bags block soil bacteria, the tomatoes won't be affected. A lot of growers use these bags just because of the problem with verticillium wilt. If there is some problem with the soil you purchased, Penn State can let you know. You will have room in the comment section to tell them what to look for.

  - From my research, it appears that Box Elder bugs do not infest tomato plants.  From looking at the photos you sent, I believe the insects on your tomato plants are Potato Aphids.  Potato aphids do feed on tomato plants.  They are identified by their  pear-shaped, light green or sometimes pink colored . They have long  antennae and two cornicles ("tail pipes") on the rear of their abdomen.

  - Your tomato plants do not look like they have been affected by insect or disease issues. This looks like environmental damage such as early exposure to cold weather. In some instances if the plants were in a greenhouse and not properly hardened off, this may be a factor. Also, the plants look pale and a little beat up. All you can do is prune damaged foliage. Fertilize with a soluble fertilizer to give the plants a boost and prevent early season nutrient stress. The new growth does not look too bad. However, if you have to remove too much of the plant, you have time to start over with new plants.

  - Hello,  Salicylic acid, a closely related enzyme to acetylsalicylic acid found in aspirin, has been studied in plants for some time.  The studies I reviewed were conducted by universities or the USDA and the salicylic acid was dissolved in water, at very specific doses, and sprayed on the leaves or were used to water the plants. Some doses were toxic and caused yellowing leaves.  This statement is from Cornell University---  "Salicylic acid, the chemical compound found naturally in most plants (as well as in the most-used medication, aspirin), is a plant hormone produced at elevated levels in response to attack by microbial pathogens. According to a report on the Web today in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS Early Edition, week of Dec. 7, 2003) by BTI's Dhirendra Kumar and Daniel F. Klessig, the aspirin-like hormone is perceived by the SABP2 protein and a message is transmitted, via a lipid-based signal, to activate the plant's defense arsenal."  This article, from the University of Arizona, is a brief discussion on the history of the research and aspirin use in the garden--- https://cals.arizona.edu/yavapai/anr/hort/byg/archive/plantimmunesystems.html  And this article refers directly to the USDA study on tomatoes---  http://www.growingproduce.com/vegetables/study-pretreating-plants-with-aspirin-like-compound-may-hel...  As the Detroit News article states, in small doses you may see some benefit. You may want to conduct your own experiment and leave at least one third of your tomatoes untreated, or as a backup, if you get an adverse response.

  - The weather will be unusually hot this weekend. The soil surface is dry for this time of year in some parts of the state. Unusually hot and dry weather is not an ideal time to transplant plants. Your existing plants may need to be watered several times a day. The plant tags will tell you how long it will take before harvest begins. You can determine when the harvest will begin by using the planting date as day 1. A tomato that matures in 65 days will be ripe in 65 from transplanting. The soil temperature is unusually warm this spring so warm season crops will mature in less than 65 days if the weather continues to be warm. Your plants are a nice size. Smaller plants often develop a better root system. Short and stocky plant are better that tall plants. If you select new transplants you might want to try different varieties.

  - Yes, there are aphids. what I see most of are aphids and the cast skins of aphids.The photos of the others insects are notwell defined enough forme totell what they are.Insecticidal soap can be used to control aphids. Follow thelabel directions for use. Depending on how long these plants have been in the ground some may have been "a gift with purchase", in other words, already on the plants when you bought them. Sometimes, they are overlooked when you buy them, but it is a good idea to examine the plants closely before buying them to make sure they aren't carrying any unwelcome guests. I would recommend that you do control the aphids, because there are several viruses they can transmit that couldcause significant harm.

  - We are not sure of what is going on with the tomato plants. In your photo we notice a piece of landscape fabric around the plant and do not know why. The plants are located near a fence and are wondering if they are getting enough sunlight. Plants need a minimum of 6 hours of direct sunlight and will be more productive with 8-10 hours of sun. Also, you may be dealing with a nutrient deficiecyand low pH. Peat moss can tend to lower the pH. Test your soil if not done recently. Results give pH and nutrient deficiencies. Tomatoes grow best in a pH of 6.3-6.8. See our vegetable profile for care and fertilization recommendations http://extension.umd.edu/growit/lack-nutrients-vegetableshttp://extension.umd.edu/hgic/soils/soil-testingAt this point, you may want to give the plants a boost by watering them in with a balanced liquid fertilizer.

  - Thank you for the question. Your tomato plants might be OK. Remove the snapped off stem leaving as many leaves in place as possibleand watch them closely for the rest of the week. The leaves will help the plant recover by harnessing the sun's energyfor growth. Healthy young tomato plants have a chance to regrow from the main stalk after weather events like this. If you don't see new growth by next Monday, plant new ones.Thank you for contacting Extension.

  - For tomatoes, typically you should mix fertilizer into the soil at the time of planting. Then side dress with fertilizer again when the plants start to produce fruit. With liquid fertilizer, put the solution in a watering can and water at the base of the plant (avoid wetting the leaves). With a solid fertilizer, you can sprinkle it around the base of the plant and then water it in. It helps to keep the fertilizer in place if you can mix it with a little bit of soil, then water it in. It needs to be watered well for the granules to break down so the nutrients become available to the plant.Take a look at our web page on tomatoes, for additional growing tips:https://extension.umd.edu/growit/vegetable-profiles-tomatoesBesuretopruneupthebottom leavestoincreaseaircirculation around the plants.Thiswillhelp preventsomeofthecommonlateseason diseases wetypicallyseeintomatoes.ckc

  - The curling and twisting and undersized leaves are probable symptoms of herbicide contamination. Tomato is sensitive to certain types of growth regulator fertilizer.The most common culprit is 2,4-D. Very small amounts of 2,4-D can drift a great distance from the site where it's sprayed and land on garden plants. In other cases the herbicide is applied as a "weed &amp; feed" product and is carried off-site by rainfall and gravity to garden sites.The least likely scenario is that your compost is contaminated with other types of herbicides that act as growth regulators (clopyralid or aminopyralid). Problems with these herbidides have been far fewer in recent years because there use is more restricted. But it would be a good idea to test the garden soil with the compost using the bioassay test in this publication:  https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/herbicide-carryover Essentially,youplantpeaorbeanseedsinsomesmallcontainerscontainingthesoilandcompostandobservethegrowthoftheseedlings.

  - Tomatoes prefer slightly acidic soil. You should fertilize with a fertilizer higher in phosphorus, like a 6-10-4. Later in the season the plant will need additional nitrogen. Too much nitrogen early in the season will promote growth instead of fruit. Take it easy with the fertilizer.

## 84117_California
* askextension_tomato/84117_California
  - Tomato plants require even moisture in the soil to prevent cracking and fruit drop.    Even soil moisture is achieved by a combination of watering and mulch.     Mulch will prevent soil water evaporation so the water in the soil is available for the plant between watering. Use bark mulch or straw. Both are good. Mulch also prevents splashing soil onto plant which prevents damage, increases water infiltration, and eventually breaks down into soil nutrients.    Cracking of tomatoes occurs when there is not enough water in the soil. The tomato expands into a fruit so fast, cracking occurs if the plant cannot bring enough water up from the soil.    Blossom end rot is another problem that can occur from poor soil moisture. Blossom end rot occurs when there is not soil moisture to carry calcium up into the plant. Nutrients and minerals essential for plant growth and fruit production are absorbed from the soil with water.

  - No, there is not treatment that will rejuvenate the plants if they have verticillium wilt. Verticillium wilt is a common soil bore fungus that infects the plant. It plugs up the water conducting tissue of the plant. They might not die but they will never be healthy. Verticillium wilt can exist in the soil for a long time. I suspect you planted verticillium wilt resistant tomatoes at the site and these plants had verticillium and it is now in the soil. I would dig up the plants and plant something which does not get verticillium. Members of the tomato family, strawberries and raspberries all get verticillium wilt. There are verticillium wilt resistant tomatoes and they are very common. There are also some verticillium wilt resistant strawberry varieties.

  - Thank you for including the images of your tomato plants. The first image doesnt reveal anything important; its an older leaf and can be removed when its tattered and yellow.   The other 2 images, though, reveal a far more serious problem of herbicide damage (weed killers). This is most likely due to carryover herbicide that was in the manure you added to the garden. Tomatoes are extremely sensitive to several different herbicides, much more so than anything else in your garden.   Youll find a complete explanation of herbicide-carryover at http://whatcom.wsu.edu/ag/aminopyralid/images.html#img9.    To summarize, a restricted-use herbicide, available to commercial users only, is commonly used on grass crops (including pastures), also grain crops, the purpose to kill broadleaf weeds. As it turns out, some of the product clings the grasses or grains which livestock eat. They pass through the animals gut without harming the livestock. The resulting manure which may then be used by home gardeners will affect susceptible crops. Tomatoes are super-sensitive.    To verify if the manure is the source of the problem, do a simple bio-assay as is explained at the above link. (The link for the bio-assay is at the left of that page. )   If the bio-assay is negative, we will need to explore which herbicides may have been used nearby. The suspect products will have 2,4-D on the ingredients list.   If the bio-assay is positive, you can successfully grow corn in that area of the garden this year. Or you can follow the information at the above link to speed degradation of the causative herbicide. Water as if you had a crop in the ground, and till several times through the season.    Next year, all should be well but, to be certain the tomatoes you plant will thrive, repeat the bio-assay to ensure it is negative before you plant.

  - In a home vegetable garden, it is not really feasible to do an effective crop rotation to break the cycle of diseases and insect pests. The only exceptions would be if there is a known disease in the soil (verticillium wilt, fusarium wilt) or garlic white rot. The best reason to do a rotation is based on the different morphologies of root systems and how they mine the soil for nutrients differently (i.e., tap-rooted vs. shallow rooted plants). All that said, we'd really only recommend rotating garlic, if possible, as white rot (if it becomes a problem) can persist in the soil. Your best bet with garlic is prevention; purchase clean stock from a reputable nursery or online supplier.There is a good book we recommend called "Great Garden Companions." It offers some valuable suggestions for companion planting, such as using taller plants to provide some shading to other plants, etc. It is not the same as crop rotation, but offers good ideas on planting layout and what will grow well together.ckc

  - We don't recommend using the pool liner, as that is likely to impede soil drainage and aeration. When it rains, if the container becomes too saturated, this can cause root rot and decline of your plants. We can't tell from the photo how deep the container is. Tomatoes and peppers need soil that is at least a depth of 12'', to allow for good root growth. Another factor that can cause this thin growth is lack of sunlight. We see there is bamboo in the background of the photo -- do your plants get enough sun? For tomatoes and peppers to grow well, you will want to have them in a location where they receive 6 hours or more of direct sunlight each day. The yellowing of the lower leaves of the pepper may be indicative a nutritional deficiency in the soil.Take a look at the following web pages for guidance on growing peppers and tomatoes, including tips on fertilizing.

  - The pictures you provided were helpful but without seeing the actual plant and damage our assessment is not conclusive. Some possibilitiesfor the foliar damage are flea beetleor tomato psyllids. In either situation, insecticides containing carbaryl or permethrin is a treatment option.  The dark spots on the fruit are probably due to Blossom end rot.  Attached is a link to the Colorado State University Planttalk information on Common Tomato Problems that you may find helpful and provide further details on both conditions.  http://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/vegetables/1834-common-tomato-problems/

  - We don't know of any specific tomato varieties that are bred specially for growing indoors over winter (and that would give you that great summer taste!). They really do best outside in full summer sun/heat. You could choose from any variety you like to eat or want to try. There are some dwarf cultivars that are bred for container growing, or you could choose from any of the indeterminate types that are typically grown outside. All that said, we encourage you to experiment with a couple of varieties. Send us a photo if you get tomatoes in the winter -- we would be curious to know how it works out and what you tried.ckc

  - Your tomato wilting could be from a variety of sources. First I wonder if the plant received any overspray from checmicl treatment of nearby plantings or a lawn? If this is the case you could try removing the wilting vines and continue to assure proper watering to see if it will recover. There is also different types of wilt that tomorrow are suspectable to. If your plant is infected with one of the wilts it will most likely not produce well and need to be disposed of. I have placed a link below that details wilt in tomatoes. For future growing I would recommend purchase of disease resistant varieties. Additionally, one tomato plant typically needs a 2'by2' or larger browning space. Tomatoes take a lot off growing space and use a large among of nutrients from the soil.  https://extension.umd.edu/growit/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetables

## 84899_Minnesota

  - I checked with our plant pathologist. Here was her response:This is either  an environmental issue or nutrient deficiency. The earliest leaves may have been exposed and stressed by the early 90F spell. It looks like these leaves  have seen flea beetle damage and possibly hail as well.  I would recommend that  they keep an eye on the leaves that are currently healthy and the  growing point.  If the plant is growing well and the symptoms are not  progressing to new leaves, than the plant is fine. Combine transplant  shock, early summer heat, flea beetle feeding, and storms it is not  unsurprising that the leaves present early in the season were stressed. I  think it is unlikely that the symptoms progress, but if they did, they  could re-submit a picture of the new symptoms and we could take it from  there.

  - One possibility might be a wilt disease in the tomato, such as fusarium wilt. Root nematodes and other factors can also cause sudden wilt symptoms. https://extension.umd.edu/growit/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetables.Junipers do produce phelonic compounds (a form of alellopathy), but we do not have any research indicating whether this would affect tomatoes, specifically. One thing you could do, if you are curious, is to test that particular area by putting in another tomato (or tomato sucker from one of your healthy plants) and see if you get the same result.It would be an interesting experiment.ckc

  - Hopefully the tub you are using has drainage holes. If not, water won't drain out and the roots of the tomatoes will rot. Yellowing lower leaves could be an early sign of this problem.If water is draining properly, my next guess would be that the tomatoes lack fertilizer. You said you fertilized at planting time, but nitrogen leaches out of the soil quickly, especially in containers where root space is limited and especially in wet weather. You should be fertilizing them every two or three weeks.Read here about growing tomatoes in containers:http://extension.psu.edu/plants/gardening/fact-sheets/vegetable-gardening/growing-great-container-ve...

  - Hello,This is herbicide injury. Have you sprayed any herbicide near your garden? Were the planting beds all planted with the topsoil you purchased? Or was it partially mixed in?At this point, your only option is to remove and discard the tomatoes. They will never produce normally, and it's unlikely they would even bear fruit. Keep an eye on your peppers and eggplant, since they are in the same plant family.You can also do a simple bioassay of the soil to see if it's herbicide residual in the soil. You would take soil from your garden and put it in flats/containers. Then plant seeds of squash, corn, tomatoes radishes and beans.

  - Experts at the University of Maryland have this to say about tomato wilt: "There can be numerous causes of tomato plant wilting, including lack of water, very hot weather, nearby walnut trees and root-knot nematodes. Gardeners must be careful to distinguish between actual wilting of green leaves and stems and the appearance of dead leaves and stems caused by other diseases and conditions. The major diseases that produce wilting in tomatoes are fusarium wilt, verticillium wilt and bacterial wilt."Of these, bacterial wilt is most likely to cause sudden wilt that isn't associated with yellow or brown leaves.Without seeing the plant, we are unable to provide a more definitive diagnosis.

## 85351_Maryland

  - Non of the foliage appears wilted. Soft new sucker shoots appear flimsy and foliage and shoots may bend but this is not a true wilt. Wilt diseases cause healthy leaves and stems to lose turgor (go limp) with some recovery at night. These diseases start at the top or bottom of the plant, depending on the specific pathogen, and are progressive.Example- fusarium wilt and verticillium wilt:http://extension.umd.edu/growit/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetableshttp://extension.umd.edu/growit/verticillium-wilt-vegetablesjt

  - If your soil is fertile and you've been adding organic matter for many years you can get by with a 1-2 inch application of compost each year.Water the plants 1-2 times per week, especially if rainfall is deficient. If you don't see any response, make a second application of bloodmeal. Overuse of N fertilizer can encourage rank foliar growth at the expense of flowers and fruits.If plants are stunted you may want to check the root system for signs of problems, such as root knot nematode and take a soil test to check pH and nutrient levels.jt

  - The pear leaf appears to have a rust disease. caused by Gymnosporangium spp. The fungus requires two hosts. One is a member of the cypress/juniper family and one is a member of the rose family which includes many fruit trees like apple and pear. Here is a link to a fact sheet that explains the way the fungus works. If you can find the infected juniper and destroy it, the rust will disappear from your pear tree. Otherwise you either have to undertake a spraying schedule for your pear or constantly prune off any infected leaves.I can't tell from your picture where on the tomato plant the yellowing started. It is normal for lower leaves that no longer get good sunlight to look like your sample. If the plant is otherwise healthy, prune off the damaged leaves and put them in the garbage so they can't spread infection.Here is a link to Cornell's tomato MD online. You can go through the diagnostic and see if you find a match. the other option is to send a sample to Penn State's plant clinic for diagnosis. You can take it to your local extension or mail it to the plant clinic directly. Here is a link for their website.

  - It could be several things, including fungal diseases (fusarium, verticillium if the variety is not resistant to those), tomato spotted wilt virus, or juglone toxicity (if grown too close to black walnut or butternut trees - although it appears that yours are in containers, so not a likely cause). Rodent or insect feeding on the stems could cause wilting beyond the feeding site. It's not possible to determine the cause from photos. Contact your local county UW-Extension office (http://counties.uwex.edu/) and they can help determine the issue (by asking more specific questions; but it may require a sample be taken to test for the fungi to know for sure) and recommend what to do about it.

  - I'm not sure....this does not appear to be a nutritional disorder or a disease. Possibly heat/reflected sunlight off the rock and house rock. Is this on the S or W side of the house? You might try moving the pot a few feet away from the house. Next year, try fewer/no other plants in the pot to compete with the tomato.  With a small scissors or pruning shears, clip out entire "branches" of yellowed leaves.

## 85612_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/85612_Oregon
  - What you really want is at least six hours of 'full sun' per day, but tomatoes also like warm soil. it is also possible for the tomatoes to get too much sun such that it can burn the fruit. If the 'afternoon' location has at least six hours of sun during the growing season, I would opt for that location. however, you could try a cherry or grape tomato in the morning location. Since the fruit is smaller you may still get a decent crop in that location. As far as the tunnel goes, it would depend on the tunnel material. If it's a plastic covering, then the plants may get too hot. If the covering is a spun polyester (like Reemay) there is usually minimal impact on light, but that is also dependent on the weight of the fabric. Some are denser which provides more protection from cold, but it also blocks more sunlight.

  - It sound like it may be a soil drainage issue. Tomato plants will wilt if their roots are deprived of oxygen. It prevents them from respiring. The area where your tomatoes are growing may be staying saturated with water after heavy rainfall. This is often caused by low lying soils, soils high in clay, and soils that are compacted. The wilting is more pronounced during hot weather.If this is the cause, there is not much you can do about it this year other than attempt to divert any run-off water washing across your garden. Consider moving your garden to an area that drains adequately. jt

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to a number of diseases that are all pretty troublesome. The early tomato diseases are wilt and early blight. Verticillium wilt is a soil born bacteria that starts killing the plant at the bottom and works its way up. The bottom leaves turn yellow and die. Early blight is distinguishes by yellowing leaves with large brown areas. Here is a link to a university fact sheet showing pictures of the various diseases and blights.The important thing is to remove the diseases plants and plant debris, and bag them for the garbage so the disease can't spread. You can take samples to your local Penn State Extension for analysis, and get a soil test kit to test for soil borne pathogens including nematodes.

  - It looks like your tomatoes have spider mites. We do not recommend using Sevin for treatment; it will also kill the beneficial insects (natural predators) that help keep pest insects in check naturally. In other words, Sevin could make matters worse. You can use a product that contains spinosad, labeled for use on tomatoes. You can also hose off the plants to dislodge the mites. Cooling the plants down with water also helps to control them. Increasingly hot temperatures favor spider mites (they emerge earlier in the season and have more generations per year). They are becoming more of a problem in a warmer climate.Here is some additional information about spider mites and how to control them:https://extension.umd.edu//sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG13%20S...ckc

  - Hello Viki,   Thank you for your tomato plant question. Tomatoes grow best when hardened-off before you put them in the garden. For good growth tomatoes need to receive ample direct sunlight (7 or more hours per day), and air temperatures above 60 degrees. When transplanted when the weather is cool and wet, tomatoes can grow slowly and look diseased.  Cold evening temperatures can damage plants, stunt growth, interrupt pollen formation, and prevent fruit from ripening. Also, fluctuations of temperature during the day from hot to cold nights can cause uneven soil temperatures causing plant stress.   Your tomatoes may have an insect pest; however, more information is needed to diagnose your plant problem. I recommend that you contact the OSU Master Gardener Plant Clinic. The Plant Clinic team has access to a variety of resources to research plant problems and pests.  Please send the photos to the OSU Deschutes County Master Gardener Plant Clinic email: deschutesmg@oregonstate.edu.   I also recommend that you call the OSU Master Gardener Plant Clinic at (541) 548-6088, and let the Master Gardener on duty know that you are sending an email with photos. The Master Gardener will be able to talk with you to obtain additional information to help answer your questions.  You may be asked to bring samples of the plant into the extension office for closer examination. The OSU Deschutes County Extension office is located at 3893 SW Airport Way, Redmond, OR 97756.

Tomato plants are sensitive and causes could be environmental, biological, or chemical. The amount of moisture may be impacting your plants, and whether the have good drainage. The plants may have been subject to possible herbicide damage. Injury usually occurs when weed control spray drifts onto nearby plants. In some cases herbicides can drift many feet from the site of application. Tomatoes are sensitive and Injury is often seen on the young leaves.

  - You can send us photos so we can see what you may be dealing with. It is normal for the bottom leaves to yellow and drop as the  plant  ages. If you are noticing browning and leaf spotting, tomatoes can be  susceptible  to several foliar diseases.  Two common foliar  diseases  are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it   is because the management is the same.   Select disease resistant  varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the  upward spread of the  disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil  splashing, water at  the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray  with an  organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the   spread of the disease.  Fungicide  treatments can help to protect new or  un-infected foliage, they are not  curatives. It is too late to spray.   Remove infected plant  material at the end of the season.

  - Thank you for your question. You are over-fertilizing.Tomatoes have a low nitrogen requirement. Under high nitrogen conditions, vines grow excessively large at the expense of fruit production. More correctly stated, tomatoes are a fussy nitrogen feeder. On soils low in organic matter, tomatoes typically run out of nitrogen in mid-summer, reducing yields and predisposing the plants to Early Blight. At transplanting, apply one to three applications (depending on soil organic content) of a water-soluble, plant starter fertilizer. This includes any of the water-soluble products like MiracleGro. Temperatures in your greenhouse: Don't fertilize if temps are lower that 55 F. A week with daytime temperatures below 55 F stunts tomato growth, reducing yields.Mid-summer  On low organic matter soils, tomatoes typically run out of nitrogen in mid to late summer. Yellowing of the foliage, starting with lower leaves, is the typical symptom of nitrogen stress. Low nitrogen in the plant allows Early Blight disease to spread like wildfire. Keeping nitrogen levels up in mid to late summer is a primary means of Early Blight control and significantly improves yields. Fertilize tomatoes lightly as the first fruits reach two-inches in diameter. Watersoluble fertilizers (such as MiracleGro) used according to label directions make a good summer fertilizer supplement. Make applications every two to four weeks, depending on soil organic content. 717-6 If using a dry granular fertilizer, apply 21-0-0 (ammonium sulfate) at the rate of one level tablespoon per plant. Sprinkle the granular fertilizer in a wide circle 12 to 20 inches out from the plant, and water in. Dry granular fertilizers can easily kill tomatoes if over-applied.

  - You probably have some early blight starting. If caught early, removing leaves (and bagging or burning them) can help. When the pressure gets bad, fungicides may become necessary. The active ingredient you'll want to spray is chlorothalonil, brand names Daconil or Fungonil). Spray once a week, more often if it rains. It's a protectant only and will not cure anything.Keep tomatoes well-fertilized and watered (which you seem to be doing). If tomatoes are planted in garden soil, they probably don't need any calcium. If in potting media, you should always throw a small handful of lime in prior to planting for the plant's calcium requirement. Egg shells will not solubilize enough to help with calcium.Hope this helps.

  - It is hard to see in these pictures where the problem started. The one fungus disease that damages leaves but not the fruit is Septoria leaf spot. It starts as spots on leaves at the bottom of plants and works its way up the plant leaving small fruit but hardly any leaves if any. Certain practices can encourage disease development. Overhead watering of tomatoes can allow for spread of the fungus. Water by soaking ground around base of tomatoes or an alternative that is not as good would be to water in the morning which allows leaves to dry quickly. Give plants good spacing when planting to provide air circulation between plants to help reduce growth fungi.

  - Thanks for your tomato question.  The two probable culprits are either (or both) slugs and hornworms.  Slugs feast at night; hornworms are excellent at hiding among green leaves--their color.  Slugs can be slowed down with diatomaceous earth on the container earth.  It rips up their bellies.  Iron phosphate (sold as Sluggo) is safe amidst vegetable crops.  Hornworms (caterpillars) are relatively large, and can be picked off if you see them.  They can be controlled organically by Bt (a bacteria), lacewings, braconoid and trichogramma wasps and lady beetles (lady bugs).  The insects mentioned occur naturally in the environment, and your greenhouse may be acting as a blockade to keep them from controlling (eating) the eggs that developed into the caterpillars.  (They'll become moths anytime soon and quit eating.)  You can purchase these insects, but they are effective only at the egg stage.  Although there are chemicals to control caterpillars, you have to find them for the sprays to be effective.  Hope this is helpful.

## 86688_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/86688_Oregon
  - Thank you for your tomato question.  Yes; they appear to have blossom end rot.  This is caused when the plant is unable to absorb enough calcium, which is necessary for fruit production.  It is not uncommon that some species of tomatoes get it and others don't.  In native soil, it is usually evidence that the soil is too acidic, and adding calcium carbonate (like Tums for our digestive systems) helps neutralize the soil pH. You shouldn't be having this with potting soil, but adding a modest amount of agricultural lime might help.  You can buy inexpensive test kits at garden stores to measure pH (and other nutrients I'll address next paragraph).  There are 2 other factors that can cause this.  One is uneven watering, which stresses the plant.  Regular watering and adding a mulch to the top of the container may help retain water.  The second factor is fertilizer with too much nitrogen, the first number in the 12-10-5 cinfigurarion.  While this may be appropriate early in the season, tomatoes need just the opposite ratio once they start to bloom: 5-10-12 or somesuch.  The last number, potassium or potash, is necessary for fruiting.  These strategies aren't going to cure the fruits that are rotting, but they may help provide an environment for developing ones.  Hope this proves helpful.  Good luck!

  - Early blight of tomato blight is caused by a fungus, Alternaria solani.  It can over-winters in the soil and infected plants. Lesions of early blight are 1-2 mm, dry, and papery with characteristic dark concentric rings of raised and necrotic tissue. Leaf tissue often turns chlorotic (yellow) at the edge of the lesion. Remove and destroy infected leaves. Several foliar fungicides are registered for early blight. Mancozeb, chlorothalonil and copper are effective against early blight when applied at approximately 7-10 day intervals. Spraying should commence at the first sign of disease.  http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/early-blight-of-tomatoes-and-potatoes/

  - The light brown piece on the end of the tomato looks like it might have been part of the blossom. Cracking of tomato fruits can occur for several reasons. It could be due to high temperatures, too much soil moisture, or excess nitrogen. Also, some types of tomatoes are genetically more prone to cracking ('Cherokee Purple' is one type that is notorious for this). It could be duetoany one or a combination of these factors. If it just one tomato, it is probably nothing to be too concerned about. https://extension.umd.edu/growit/cracking-vegetablesckc

## 86754_Pennsylvania

  - Unfortunately, there is little you can do about early blight except scout the plants daily and remove any leaves showing signs of the fungus. Crop rotation is to avoid a soil bacteria called Vermacillium wilt that builds up around the roots of nightshade crops like the ones you are growing.Early blight spores blow up from the south and also are blown in from neighboring gardens. It's very hard to avoid getting it. I prune my plants to keep them open to breezes that will dry the leaves after rain. I make sure the plants don't contact the soil except at the main trunk. When I find damaged leaves, I throw them in the garbage so they don't keep making spores. For me, persistent hygiene is my best solution. Also, keep changing varieties. Some tomatoes are more prone to blight than others. I don't pull my plants. I just keep pulling of infected leaves. The fruit isn't harmful to eat, so there is no reason to waste it. Late blight is a different matter. It rots the whole plant in a few days and you have to get infected plants out of the garden as quickly as possible.

## 86760_Ohio

  - Sudden death of tomato plants is often caused by bacterial wilt, so I am glad you conducted the test.Tomatoes are attacked by other wilts as well, but most  cause external symptoms in the plant before it dies. Fusarium wilt and  verticillium wilt both kill a tomato plant quickly by constricting the  water-conducting tissues. If either of these wilts attacks your plant,  the first symptom is yellowing leaves. Typically the wilt starts at the bottom of the plants, as compared to bacterial wilt that typically starts from the top of the plant.You can diagnose these wilts by examining  a cross section of the stem of the tomato plant (see photos in URLs below). If the tissues inside  the stem are brown rather than ivory, one of these wilts may have been  the cause of death. If you suspect either of these wilts, here is some information about them.  Regretfully there is no treatment for these wilts. In addition, I ave attached a URL for a general fact sheet on tomato diseases.https://extension.umd.edu/growit/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetableshttps://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/verticillium-wilt-of-tomatoes-and-potato...http://www.clemson.edu/extension/hgic/pests/plant_pests/veg_fruit/hgic2217.html

  - There can be numerous causes of tomato plant wilting, including lack of  water, very hot weather, nearby walnut trees and root-knot nematodes.  You have to be able to distinguish wilting of green leaves and stems and the appearance of dead leaves and stems caused by other diseases and conditions. The most common wilt disease is fusarium wilt.  You did the right thing by removing the plant.  If you notice the other plants are wilting, test  by scraping the infected stem or split it lengthwise and you will see browning of the vascular tissue. Take a look at the website for tips for more information and managing this disease.http://extension.umd.edu/growit/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetablesThe best defense are resistant varieties.

  - Purplish leaves in young tomatoes can be an indicator of phosphorus deficiency. Your plant might not be getting enough nutrition if it is in a pot that is too small. Is this a dwarf or patio type tomato? If it is a regular (full size) tomato, we recommend a 5 gallon pot for each tomato plant. If you have several plants crowded in a pot, there will be competition for root space, water, and nutrients. You could transplant to a different pot. Some potting soil mixes already contain a general fertilizer. If yours does not, you can add a general 10-10-10 fertilizer and see if the plant improves. Also, make sure the plant gets full sunlight and sufficient water during very hot, dry weather.

  - This appears to be a fungal disease known as Septoria Leaf Spot. Below is a link to an MSU article providing more info about how the fungus affects the plants and overwinters.https://pestid.msu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/SeptoriaLeafSpotTomato.pdfFor any fungal disease, we would recommend that the infected leaves/materials be removed from the area, watering at the base of the plant rather than overhead and applying a general vegetable fungicide per the instructions on the product. The fungicide will most likely need to be re-applied every 10 to 14 days per the directions. Also, special attention should be paid to application date in relation to harvest.For future planning, crops should be rotated each year to prevent re-infection, planted at a sufficient distance to allow for good air circulation and the purchase of disease -resistant seeds or plants. Unfortunately there is no know cure for early or late blight so if weather conditions are right, the homeowner may still have to deal with these diseases. Preventative fungicide spraying will help mitigate the blight somewhat.

  - It looks like you have two things going on with your tomato plants. I was not sure how they interacted, so I called for more help from my Colorado Master Gardener buddies. Here's what they said.   1.    The pattern of yellowing leaves (top-down) doesnt fit with most diseases we see. I do not see any herbicide or insect damage/symptoms. There are no dark rings/spots that can be indicators of fungal diseases, and those leaves typically turn yellow from the bottom up, but these oldest leaves are healthy, dark green. We are left with cultural causes. Often yellow leaves has to do with overwatering, or it can be a nitrogen deficiency. However, applying too much nitrogen can make the plant produce lots of lovely dark green foliage and no fruit, so care must be taken. See the fertilization section in the early blight fact sheet: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/718.pdf I do not think this is early blight, but the first 3 paragraphs contain good information.    2.    The lack of flowers/fruit is consistent with high temperatures causing flowers to abort. Our recent day temperatures in the 90s and/or night temperatures in the mid to high 70s can lead to loss of flowers, and fruit set is sacrificed until growing conditions improve. Weve had several periods of these temperatures, starting fairly early in the season. You can try cooling the soil temperature of your plants with shade cloth suspended above the plants (like they do at Treasure Island Demonstration garden in Windsor), and/or by mulching. We have a good fact sheet on that, too: http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/715.pdf

  - Your plants are simply reacting to the hot weather. As long as they are back to normal in the cooler AM hours, there is nothing to worry about. Branches normally droop as they get larger simply from the weight of the large leaves and tomatoes. You should have some type of mulch under the plants to help conserve the moisture in the soil and keep it cooler. Mulch also prevents soil from splashing up onto the leaves of the tomatoes transferring disease organisms. Stop using the fungicides.

  - These leaf-distortion symptoms (feathering, "cobra-heading", cupping and "fanning" suggest two probable causes -  Herbicide drift injury or  Cucumber mosaic virus. Herbicide drift occurs when someone in your neighborhood applies 2,4-D type herbicides to lawn weeds on a hot day. The herbicide may drift on air currents for several hundred yards. Tomatoes are particularly sensitive to 2,4-D, showing leaf deformity symptoms soon after exposure to minute amounts of airborne 2,4-D. If 2,4-Dherbicide injury is the cause of the symptoms on your tomato, youmay find other sensitive plants in your yard or neighbors' yards showing similar leaf deformity symptoms - tomato, grape, hackberry, redbud, lilac, boxelder, Amur maple, aspen, linden, catalpa and others. Cucumber mosaic virus can cause very similar symptoms. It is often seed-borne, so you would probably see it on one variety of tomato but not on a different variety growing nearby. Herbicide injury would affect both or more varieties. Cucumber mosaic virus is so-named because it was first observed/described on cucumbers. It could infect tomatoes without infecting nearby cucumbers.

  - A bland flavor in tomatoes usually has to do with the amount of water they contain. The more water, the blander the taste. Flavor can also vary by variety, growing conditions, time of harvest, and the balance between acidity and sweetness. Individual taste perception varies as well. Some tomatoes that have been recognized for exceptional taste are:Mountain Merit (slicer)Vinitza (slicer)Blush (cherry)Sungold (cherry)Pink Tiger (cherry)Gilbertie (plum)ckc

  - Thanks for contacting us again. Tomatoes have a low nitrogen requirement, needing a boost mid-summer, and you are taking care of that (you were correct about that all along). Sulfur is a minor nutrient, but being deficient would not look like this and it would affect all of your plants. Sulfur is also used to treat fungal diseases. Our most common fungal disease is early blight, which produces yellow leaves with target-shaped lesions on the leaves starting with the lower leaves and moving up the plant, but the yellowing pattern appears to be top-down on your plants. (Is that correct?) The chlorosis (yellowing leaves) does not appear to be early blight.    Your symptoms are not commonly seen by us, and Im getting some help from our diagnostic lab  just need more information, please.    Are the plants that are declining - Heirlooms? Hybrids? What are the varieties?   How about the plants that are doing well  heirlooms, hybrids, what varieties.  Are you seeing any evidence of insects, especially psyllids (they are tiny, but can be recognizable by their poop that looks like salt or sugar has been sprinkled on the plant).  Any purple color on the stems or base/crown of the plant?  Cut a lower or main stem and look inside at the vascular tissue  describe the color.   Did you plant in this same location last year, and did you have any problems?              Feel free to include your phone number and I can call you back for discussion, if you like.   Well get to the bottom of this!   Karin

  - Dear Client, I must give credit to the Yakima County Master Gardeners for helping me with an answer to your question. I would suggest that you follow up with the Master Gardener program in your County. To quote from Ortho Home Gardeners Problem Solver, The yellowing of foliage from a loss or breakdown of chlorophyll.  Yellowing may result from disease or insect infestation, poor growing conditions, or lack of nutrients. So both your concerns are possible causes of leaf yellowing. It may be helpful if you capture the symptoms with digital images and repost those images on this website.  More information is needed to diagnose this problem. FS145E Growing Tomatoes in Home Gardens- a Washington State University Extension Fact Sheet may provide some information. Also see: WSU Hortsense which is a good reference (good pictures) for the more common problems tomato plants can experience. http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/FS145E/FS145E.pdf http://hortsense.cahnrs.wsu.edu/Search/MainMenuWithFactSheet.aspx?CategoryId=5&amp;PlantDefId=56 Hope this information helps!

  - It's hard to say because lots of animals will eat tomatoes including deer, squirrels, groundhogs, raccoons and voles. Deer can jump nine feet to get over a fence, for example. There are a few things you can try. One is to sprinkle powdered lime around the plants so you can see footprints and identify the thief. Another is to put up wire cages around the tomato plants. You can try a water scarecrow if you garden on a flat place. Tomatoes can be picked when the color starts to turn because at that point the vine is done feeding the fruit. You can also buy wildlife netting and cover the tomatoes if you don't want to pick them. It's a matter of persistence until you defeat the thief.

  - The ripening of tomatoes can vary by the type of cultivar you are growing and also can be slowed down by high temperatures above 85F. We do not recommend pruning them to increase exposure to the sun, as that can cause sunscald.

  - We are so glad you asked!The black droppings, stripped leaves and tomatoes with bites missing are very indicative of the tomato hornworm. They are large, but can be very hard to see as they blend in so well.Here is a page about them:http://extension.umd.edu/growit/insects/tobaccotomato-hornworm You can either pick it/them off, or if they have white, rice-like cocoons on  backs, leave them in place as their days are numbered because a beneficial insect is parasitizing them. (layed eggs in the worm, which hatch, then eat their way out.)The brown end on the first tomato is also common and called Blossom End Rot. It is a physiologic problem related to lack of calcium and ability to take up enough water.Take a look in this publication for more about that: http://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG56%20IPM...cm

  - There are varieties that do have tough skins: roma and plum. However, if the grape tomatoes have tough skins it could be due to high temperatures and lack of water. Tomatoes like consistent watering. Check at the base of your plants and when the top two inches are dry then go ahead and water. You could also shade the plants during the late afternoon to help reduce the high temperatures. Thanks for your business.Linda

  - This is a fairly common problem in tomatoes called blossom end rot. It does not affect the taste of tomatoes and can be cut off before eating them.It most commonly occurs when there is uneven moisture to the tomato plants (i.e., they dry out and then are watered excessively). This interferes with the plant's ability to absorb calcium. There is sufficient calcium in our soil so the addition of calcium is not recommended for this problem. Another common contributing factor can be excessive nitrogen fertilizer.One way to mitigate BER is to try to keep the plant evenly moist. This is not always easy when they're planted in pots but the addition of mulch should help alleviate this condition.

  - The tomatoes take longer to ripen when air temperatures are above 85 degrees. They also like soil temps to be below 80 degrees. Our weather went from cool and rainy in Spring to hot and dry as of late. The plants became stressed and are using more of their energy to develop their roots systems. This cool snap we're having now may help equalize their energy distribution. Please read the article below about tomatoes and feel free to write back with more questions.

  - Hello,If you want to confirm that it is tomato spotted wilt virus, you can submit samples to the CSU Plant Diagnostic lab. Dr. Tamla Blunt can do a fairly quick and inexpensive test to determine if the plants have been affected by the virus. But based on your description, it sounds like it is TSWV. http://plantclinic.agsci.colostate.edu/Yes, you can eat the tomatoes, though they may never develop the flavor you expect or reach full maturity. But eating them will not harm you. The pattern in the fruit is from the virus.However, the plants really shouldberemoved andthrown in thetrash.This virus spreads via thrips, a small insect. The best control would be sanitation. You should remove the affected plants. Plant clean stock and consider not planting in the same area for a few years (practice crop rotation). You can also plant tomato cultivars that are resistant to this virus. Cleaning your tools will also be important. Remove weeds near the plants.Here is more information on this disease: http://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/garden/02947.pdf

  - How disappointing!  Finally you get ripe tomatoes and they're mealy. Causes of mealy, mushy tomatoes include uneven watering, too much direct sun, extreme temperature fluctuations, even too much nitrogen. The very hot weather we're having after a fairly cool start to the summer may be the culprit. The sun gold tomatoes are small enough to not be affected      Maintain a consistent watering program, prune your tomatoes to let air circulate, and watch for insect pests. Hopefully, when the plants settle into good production, your tomatoes will attain the flavor and texture you've been working to achieve.

## 88139_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/88139_Oregon
  - Thank you for your tomato question.  Your fruit have a very common problem called blossom end rot.  This is caused when the pH of the soil is too law (acidic), so that the calcium in the soil can't be absorbed by the plant.  This can be remedied for future tomatoes (but not the afflicted ones) by purchasing some agricultural lime (calcium carbonate) or dolomite lime, and applying it per label directions.  You may yet get some 'normal' fruit.  Our clay soil is normally acidic, so next year, buy an inexpensive 'tomato soil test kit' and check for pH before you plant.  Tomatoes prefer a pH between 6.0 and 6.8 (water is neutral at 7.0) and add lime to bring up ("sweeten") the soil.  Rather like taking Tums!    Hope this is helpful.  Good luck!

## 88204_Michigan

  - I suspect the whitish areas are caused by insect feeding. This kind of damage can affect the taste of the fruit but it is safe to eat. As the fruit matures the whitish areas will remain under the skin.  It is likely to be stink bugs causing this.

## 88206_Colorado

  - Temperatures below 55 day or night may slow growth and inhibit pollination or fruit set. Some tomato varieties are more tolerant of cool temperatures - for example Stupice and Early Girl. Some determinate varieties are more tolerant of cooler temperatures. Mulch with black plastic sheet. You could save a few plastic milk cartons and paint them black, fill with water and set them near tomato plants. They'll provide some passive warmth. -Cover plants with a "cage" of wire meshandclear plastic . Remove cage as it becomes sunny or warms back to 65 or 70 degrees. - cover plants with "floating row cover" like Reemay. see also:  http://www.ext.colostate.edu/mg/Gardennotes/722.pdf

## 88275_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/88275_Colorado
  - Thank you for your question and your pictures. This is Early blight(Alternarialeaf spot) it is caused by the fungus Alternaria solani. Symptoms become prevalent during the hotter months. This disease produces brown to black, target-like spots on older leaves. If severe, the fungus also attacks stems and fruit. Affected leaves may turn yellow, then drop, leaving the fruit exposed to sunburn. Sanitation is the best control. Remove all diseased plant tissue on the ground, as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris. Do not plant tomatoes in the same place next year. Space plants farther apart to improve air circulation. Avoid overhead irrigation. You can try sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection.It is not recommended to eat fresh or frozen diseased tomatoes even if the diseased parts have been cut out. The disease organism by itself is not harmful but the tissue damage causes the tomatoes to have lower acidity and creates conditions that promote the growth of other potentially harmful microorganisms. The tomatoes may or may not have an off flavor. They definitely should not be canned.

  - Hello.  Without seeing the critter I dont want to speculate. I recommend that you go out at night and look with a flashlight. Also examine your plants and look for eggs on the fruit or on the leaves. Two types of worms attack tomatoes as well as slugs and all can do major damage. Capture the critter or photograph it and get it or the photo to the Master Gardener information help desk to find out about control methods. Caterpillars tend to leave behind frass (poop) which usually looks like blackish pellets in the damaged fruit or very close to it. The larger the caterpillar the larger amounts of frass. I cant recommend control methods without knowing what is causing the problem. The help desk phone number is 541-766-6750. You should call before visiting the desk with samples to ensure a Master Gardener is on duty. The desk is in the Benton County OSU Extension office, 4077 SW Research Way, Corvallis.

## 88315_Pennsylvania

  - Based on your description, I think what you are seeing is called yellow shoulder. It is not a disease but rather caused by complex set of environmental and physiological conditions that lead to plant stress. One factor is heat which prevents the lycopene (responsible for the red color) from being produced and fruit tested has been low in potassium. Some varieties are more sensitive than others as well. One suggestion would be to harvest the fruit when they first start to turn red and finish ripening them indoors in the dark. This reduces direct stress on the plant and will encourage lycopene production.

## 88328_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/88328_Oregon
  - Thank you for attaching the images to your inquiry. They appear to be a bit undersized for the apparently large plants. Sudden drying strongly suggests that the plants ran dry during this unusual, extended heat wave here in the northwest. Drying rate depends upon multiple factors. Among them the size of the container relative to the plant; the kind of growing mix in the container (potting soil or your own mix?); the number of drippers per container; and how often, also how long, the system was run.    The fruits may have multiple problems. I see cracking which can be caused by an uneven water supply. The plant runs a bit dry, then skin toughens up; and after water is supplied, the skin cracks.   Although Im not convinced, the darkened areas on the fruits could be late blight. If so, the plants are probably dead, or nearly so, by now. If that is what occurred, clean up all plant debris very thoroughly and discard in the trash, not the yard debris bin. Do not compost it.   The dimpled areas on the fruits could have been caused by the probing mouthparts of stink bugs. If so, and depending upon which kind of stink bugs they were, the underlying corky tissue may either be extensive and need to be trimmed out or minor and ignored.

## 88347_Colorado

  - There could be a couple of reasons. The tomato is probably a non-determinate variety meaning it will keep vining until frost so they do get quite big. Also, thedaysto maturity range from about 50 to 90days depending on the cultivar. Yours may be a cultivar with a long maturity - a lot of the heirloom types do - in which case, you just need to be patient. If you kept your tag, it should list days to maturity there. If this is the explanation, you might in future years make a point of planting a couple different cultivars, some with short maturity days and others with long.If you have been fertilizing, the nitrogen in the fertilizer may have been pushing vegetative growth. If that's the case, I recommend you cut back which will encourage your plant to stop putting on leaves and start putting on fruit.Tomatoes also abort blossoms if the day temperatures get over 90 degrees. There's nothing you can do about that, but if it's the reason you weren't getting fruit, the problem will resolve itself as the really hot temperatures abate (knock on wood).Lastly, to get fruit, the blossoms need to be pollinated. If you aren't seeing any pollinators, try flicking the blossoms gently with your thumb and forefinger to transfer pollen from the stamens to the pistil.

## 88442_Pennsylvania
* askextension_tomato/88442_Pennsylvania
  - It depends on the kind of blight you have. For tomatoes, you can do a pretty good job of controlling it by picking off the damaged leaves every day. Early blight comes up from the south on air currents and some of it always lands on susceptible plants. I pick leaves off my beans and tomatoes every day. I take them in the house and throw them in the garbage because they keep producing spores as long as any plant tissue remains. Some varieties are less susceptible to leaf blight than others. If you have a lot of trouble with early blight, you might want to look for more resistant cultivars. If your tomatoes are rotting and turning black, that's late blight. The only thing you can do about late blight is pull out the plants and bag them for the garbage. If you have powdery or downy mildew on your cukes and zucchini, that can take out the entire plant. Once it is visible, it's too late to use sprays. The fungus spreads inside the plant and then pops out to start making spores. That's when yous see it. Here is a link to a publication on diseases of squash and cucumbers.Apple trees require a regular maintenance schedule. Here is a link to a good publication by Penn State called Fruit Production for the Home Garden. There is a chapter on apple trees that might be helpful.You can take samples of your infected plants to your local Penn State Extension and have them sent to the plant clinic for diagnosis. Then you will know exactly what is wrong and they will recommend a course of action.

  - How many tomato plants does this involve?When did you plant them in the hoop house (how early in the season)? Can you protect the plants from a chill long enough totake the plants from your home to the hoop house for a just a few hours each day when the interior temperatures are warm enough (tomatoes are happiest at 70 -75 degrees F) and then increase the hours each day until you plant them? The soil temperature can also affect the growth of the tomato, so were the soils warm enough in the hoop house when you planted them (around 55 - 60 degrees F)? The only other possibility I can think of is to put a shade coverabove the tomatoes when you first plant them in the hoop house and then remove the shade for longer periods of timeover the course of a couple of weeks, until the plants are acclimatized to thehigher sunlight and growing conditions.

  - Thank you for contacting us regarding your question. Tomatoes are a favorite in many gardens, and unfortunately in Ohio sometimes our weather and length of growing season does not cooperate. There are also some disease issues that may cause issues with your plants.Many times the yellowing and dying starting at the bottom can be signs of several things? Have you planted tomatoes in the same spot each year? Do you fertilize your plants? Do you consistently water these plants? Do you only have one plant that is affected? Pictures of plant and fruit is helpful in determining some of the issues. Sometimes it is as simple as the weather change overnight andcausesfruit drop. Tomato fruit set and development is considerably affected by overnight temperatures. When temperatures are over 75 F or under 55 F at nighttime, fruit has difficulty setting and maturing.Texas A&amp;M has a great tomato problem solver: http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/vegetable/problem-solvers/tomato-problem-solver/

## 88601_Pennsylvania

  - Septoria Leaf Spot Damage: Spots are initially small and dark in color; eventually, the center of the spot becomes whitish to light brown, with tiny, dark specks evident in the light area. Septoria does not cause spots on the fruit.  Septoria leaf spot symptoms usually start on the oldest leaves. Spotted leaves die prematurely, resulting in early defoliation, fruit sunscald, and poor fruit color. Cultural: Choose a sunny planting site. Avoid garden areas where tomatoes were grown within the past few years. Ensure adequate fertility by following soil test recommendations. Space plants to promote drying off of leaves and fruit. When leaf surfaces are dry, remove and discard any blighted bottom leaves as soon as they are affected. Remove all crop debris at the end of the season to reduce a potential source of the pathogen next season. Chemical: Use appropriate fungicides when necessary. If leaf blights occur most years, spray with labeled fungicides when diseases are anticipated at the onset of fruiting and repeat at 7-day intervals as needed. Follow label directions.

  - Blossom end rot is typically caused by a calcium deficiency. It's possible that the first round of fruit depleted the soil of the available calcium so subsequent fruit has an issue. If the soil is not evenly moistand dries out, any calcium in the soilis less available. I don't know of any studies that look at how different varieties of tomatoes may have differing calcium needs. Over-fertilizing or using a high-nitrogen fertilizer can tie up available calcium. Depending on how much of the fruit is affected, you can cut off the rot but in your example picture it's affected a lot of the fruit, so it may be better to pick the fruit and discard. You can try adding some lime to the soilto see if you can address any new fruit set now (meaning the bees pollinate new flowers now)but I'm not sure there is enough left in the season for new fruit to fully ripen.

  - Once a tomato has a tiny fungal infection or nick, either the fungus will expand or bacterial rot will get in and the fruit rots like the ones you see. The fungus could be anthracnose or alternaria, it doesn't matter. In each case, the solution is to pick the fruit as soon as it colors and bring it inside to ripen. It will not cause the flavor to be bad and it protects your fruits from rot. Tomatoes do not need sunlight in order to produce good flavor once it begins coloring. With all the rain and humidity we have had, fungi are having a heyday. Bring your tomatoes in. ECN

  - Thanks for contacting Ask and Expert. There is a safety risk for botulism in the preserving method that you describe from the blog that you read.Let me direct you to a resource that you will enjoy, Herbs and Vegetables in Oil (SP 50-701) that you can find on the OSU Extension Food Preservation Publications web page: http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/food-preservation. All of our publications are research-based and tested in university labs for safety and quality.In this publication you can find a recommendation to store raw or cooked vegetables or raw herbs in oil in clean, sterilized jars in the refrigerator for no longer than 4 days before it is used, discarded or frozen. On page 2, there is a recipe for Dried Tomatoes in Oil that is shelf stable (or until the oil turns rancid). In this recipe the dried tomatoes are briefly dipped in bottled lemon juice before submerged in oil in a clean, sterilized jar. Cap and store in a dark cupboard. Wait about 1-2 months before eating and they will develop a dark, rich color, deep flavor and chewiness perfect for an hors d'oeurve with cream cheese or pesto (recipe also on page 2) or pasta or pizza topping. The oil takes on the flavor, too, and is wonderful in salad dressings or used in a sautee.Other resources from OSU Extension that you might like are the Food Safety/Preservation Hotline, 1-800-354-7319, staffed by OSU Extension Master Food Preservers, M-F, 9AM to 4PM (except Holidays) and the OSU Extension Food Preservation Facebook Page.

  - Blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency in the tomato. However, it is not because there is not enough calcium in the soil, but because the tomato plant can't take it up. And the reason for that is usually cultural or environmental: too much water, inconsistent water, too much fertilizer, cultivating around the plant, tomato variety, and so on. Read here:http://blog-yard-garden-news.extension.umn.edu/2016/07/prevent-blossom-end-rot.htmlFor what it's worth, blossom end rot tends to affect mostly the first tomatoes to ripen and not so much the later tomatoes.

## 88895_Maryland

  - A common misconception is that tomatoes are a high acid food. With a pH of 4.6 tomatoes are right on the border between being high or low acid. The tomato variety, weather, soil conditions, and growing conditions (blight and diseased plants), and ripeness of the fruit can easily tip the acidity level to the low acid side of the scale. You are correct in your concern that heirloom tomatoes may not be acidic enough.     It is recommended that if you are canning heirloom or any other variety of tomato, you increase acidity be adding 2 Tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or  teaspoon citric acid to each quart to insure safety of the canned product.  These guidelines are from the USDA Complete Guide to Home Canning.  You also need to process the jars for the proper amount of time in a boiling water bath: crushed tomatoes hot packed - 45 minutes at altitudes of 1000 ft. or less, whole or halved tomatoes in their own juice  85 minutes at altitudes of 1000 ft. or less.  Use up-to-date instructions.    Tomatoes can also be pressure canned.  Canning information can be found at http://extension.psu.edu/food/preservation/safe-/tomatoes/extension_publication_file    Some research has been conducted on the acidity of tomatoes, including some varieties of heirloom tomatoes, which can be found at https://www.joe.org/joe/2010december/rb6.php.

  - It is possible you have Tomato Hornworms.  You will have to look closely as they blend in with the foliage but they are a very large caterpillar. The also eat the leaves so look to see if that is happening.  Squirrels tend to pick the tomatoes before they take a bite and toss them.  Birds usually don't peck tomatoes.  Check thoroughly.  It is less likely that slugs or picnic beetles are responsible.  Here is a link to all three: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/fruitholes.html

  - The browning on the bottom of your tomatoes is evidence of blossom end rot due to the lack of nutrients (calcium and magnesium). Have you added any amendments to your soil after the plants have fruited? If not, that could be one of the problems. The other could be that the plants have developed some kind of wilt that plagues tomatoes quite often, if you don't rotate your crops. If you had this same problem last year in that same bed, chances are the tomatoes are suffering the exact disease as it did before. It's best to plant different vegetables in your beds every third or fourth year, at the minimum. Some tomato varieties are more prone to wilt and other diseases than others (mostly heirlooms). It may be too late to correct the soil now, since it looks like the plant is well on it's way with fruiting. However, it's worth a shot to add some calcium and magnesium now, if the plant is still producing fruit. It may not correct the leaf curl, but perhaps the blossom end rot of newer, and less mature tomatoes. Good luck!

  - Thank you for your question! The photos show symptoms that are consistent with a virus, perhaps tomato spotted wilt virus or tobacco mosaic virus. Photos of the entire plant, and a closer view of the leaves, may help as viral diseases often cause foliar distortions, such as cupping or downturned leaves. Symptoms on the fruit usually begin with target-like spots that eventually coalesce into larger lesions. The tissue of the fruit becomes discolored and distorted as the infection progresses.Late blight is a possibility as cool-to-moderate, wet weather favors the development of this disease, and we have seen those conditions in the last several weeks. The disease is caused by fungus-like pathogen called an oomycete.Viral diseases in tomatoes are not treatable, and removal of the plant is recommended. Rotating tomatoes to a different area of the garden from year to year is a good cultural practice to ensure diseases do not build up in one area.There are tomato varieties that are resistant to viral diseases. Seed packets will indicate resistant qualities. Heirlooms tend not to be resistant.For more information about tomato diseases, please see CSU Extension Fact Sheet "Recognizing Tomato Problems", which includes a list of common disease symptoms seen on fruit and foliage. Late blight plants should also be culled as the disease can spread through spores, especially at this advanced stage.Clean up all diseased plant material as soon as possible and dispose of it in the trash. It is a good idea to remove and dispose of all tomato, pepper, and potato plants at the end of the season if you've had diseased plants as the same diseases can affect all of these related crops.

## 89075_Oregon

  - Thank you for your question regarding your tomatoes. I believe what you are referring to is "blossom end rot." Inconsistent watering can, indeed, be the root of many evils, but if you have this problem, it means that the soil in which your tomatoes are planted is to acidic. Soil acidity is measured on a scale of 1 to 14; 7 is neutral--water. Our clay soils tend to be more acidic--lower numbers. Many plants (tomatoes, peppers, eggplant) are unable to absorb calcium when the soil acidity is below 6.0, and the 'sign' of the problem is black spots on the ends of the fruits.The way to 'sweeten' the soil--bring the acidity level up to 6.0 to 6.5 or 6.8 (depending on the authority)--is to add lime, either in the form of agricultural lime or dolomite lime (which also has magnesium.) Adding too much will overshoot the mark, so amounts are critical. (It's chemically like taking Tums--calcium carbonate--for acid stomach!) Here's a linkto an Extension article that explains it (go down to "Common Problems"). However, adding lime isn't going to solve this year's fruit problems. The best you can do is learn from this year and prevent it from happening next.I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck!

  - It looks like there are some symptoms of septoria leaf spot and early blight on the foliage. These are very common problems in tomatoes in our area. The humidity and moisture are ideal for development of these fungal diseases, and they co-occur around the same time. The management practices for both of these diseases is the same. Take a look at the following page on our website. https://extension.umd.edu/growit/early-blight-vegetablesThis plant looks finished for the season. Any tomatoes that have started to ripen can be brought inside to finish ripening. (Do not refrigerated them.) In the future, consider choosing tomato varieties that have disease resistance.

  - It is normal for the bottom leaves to yellow and drop as the  plant   ages. If  you are noticing browning and leaf spotting, tomatoes can be    susceptible  to several foliar diseases.  Two common foliar  diseases    are early blight and septoria.  They can also co-occur on the same plant. Humidity and moisture are ideal for development of the diseases but it does not matter which disease it     is because the management is the same. Select disease  resistant   varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the  upward  spread of the   disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil   splashing, water at   the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing,  and spray  with an   organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the  season to lessen the    spread of the disease.  Fungicide  treatments  can help to protect new or   un-infected foliage, they are not   curatives. It is too late to spray.    Remove infected plant  material  at the end of the season.  There is nothing you can do at this point to fix the problem. Pick  off the tomatoes that are already showing color. You can keep them on a  counter top inside to let them finish ripening.

  - The late blight on tomatoes is difficult to eradicate but there are a few things you can do to lessen the impact for next year.  There is nothing yet developed that you can put in the soil to kill the late blight spores, but early next spring - Heres another way to fix your soil for next year from Backyard Living Magazine, March/April 2007:  Once infected, tomatoes cant be helped. The key is solarizing the soil to kill the bacteria before they get to the plants. As soon as you can work the soil, turn the entire bed to a depth of 6, then level and smooth it out. Dig a 4-6 deep trench around the whole bed and thoroughly soak the soil by slowly running a sprinkler over it for several hours. Cover the bed with a clear, heavy plastic painters drop cloth. Lay the edges of it in the trench and cover with soil to keep heat from escaping. The sun should heat the area for at least 6 weeks. The longer you leave the cover in place, the better.This fall do a thorough cleanup of the garden and get rid of all possible infected plant material - burn it or bag it, do not compost it.  Then next year when you are getting ready to start your garden, use late blight resistant tomato varieties and move the tomato plants to a portion of the garden that they were not in for the last 3 years.  Again next year at the first sign of late blight infection, pull the plant and destroy.  Please check this site for some disease resistant varieties - https://gardening.cals.cornell.edu/files/2015/12/Fact-sheet-2017-List-of-varieties-resistance-to-lat...  Good luck.

  - It looks like a color disorder" called "yellow shoulder". It is not entirely understood, but is thought to be a problem with the roots not being able to take up enough potassium from the soil. It is more prevalent when growing conditions are less than ideal; e.g., there is a greater tendency for yellow shoulder and other color disorders when the soil pH (acidity level) is 6.7 or higher and when the amount of organic matter in the soil is less than 2.4 percent.    Some tomato varieties are more susceptible to this disorder than others. The white areas inside the fruits are not a problem for eating or canning. Just cut off and discard the hard white portions. To minimize yellow shoulder, you might want to have your soil tested and make amendments according to the recommendations you get back with the soil test report. Make sure to note on the test form the problem you are having with your tomatoes.  Here is a link to our Soil Testing Laboratory: http://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/

## 89505_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/89505_Oregon
  - Good afternoon!  Is the rot you're describing occurring at the blossom end of the fruit?  If so, this is commonly called blossom end rot, and it is the result of a lack of calcium in the fruit.  It commonly occurs on the first fruit of the season when plants are still actively growing and calcium is following the flow of water to the leaves.  Later in the season, "inconsistent water" can contribute to this problem, as can a lack of calcium in the soil.  Applying a calcium chloride spray (which is commonly available in many garden centers) directly to the fruit can help prevent this in fruit that has not yet developed the symptoms.  This issue seems to be worse for some varieties than in others.  Quali T 23 and Roma are two varieties I have had issues with in the past.  If you have never had a soil test, now is a great time to take one, as lime can be added in the fall to prevent this issue next year. Here are a couple of links you may find useful...https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/ec628.pdfhttps://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/em8677_0.pdfExcessive nitrogen can also cause blossom end rot, because it promotes foliar growth that steals the calcium from developing fruit. Regarding irregular water, tomatoes have very deep roots once established (unless in pots, of course), so you don't want to water too often. My general rule of thumb is to let the soil dry out to the touch up to the first knuckle on your index finger, which is a depth of about 1 inch. Watering once or twice a week should be adequate.

  - This phenomena is called catfacing.  The exact cause is not known.  It occurs more commonly on large heirloom type tomatoes.   Some possible explanations include:  Herbicide exposure and ineffective pollination due to cold weather snaps with temps below 50.  There are also some growth cracks which are the result of uneven watering.  Later blossoms which were pollinated during warmer weather may produce normal fruit.  Fertilizing may or may not help with the squash. Some varieties are paler.

It has been tested for safety without the addition of lemon juice.  Processing at 15 pounds is not a safety issue however my question to you is, are you canning in a pressure canner or a cooker. Does your canner hold at least 4 quart jars? If so you are good to go. If not you could be under processed even though you canned it at 15 pounds pressure. If your canner is smaller it will heat up and cool down to quickly to safely process your food.

You also need to have acidified the tomatoes using either 1 tablespoon of bottled lemon juice per pint or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid per pint or 2 tablespoons of bottled lemon juice per quart or 1/2 teaspoon citric acid per quart.  Or use it up within the week or freeze the contents in another container for use later.The answer all depends upon if you properly used the correct techniques and identified the unsealed jar within 24 hours.

  - Based on the picture, it does appear that there is a phosphorous deficiency in your tomatoes which can be a result of cold soil temperatures (occurs usually in the spring), improper soil pH (acidity below 6.5 or alkalinity greater than 7.5), extremely wet soil or a deficiency in the soil. The cool soil , pH and wet soil issues will inhibit phosphorous uptake from the soil.To know more about your soil health we would recommend you test your soil to determine if the problem is a pH or nutrient issue. Soil test kits can be ordered through MSU atthe following link. http://www.msusoiltest.com/The cost is $25 and everything you need will be provided in the kit. You will receive your results via email within a week or two and will easily be able to see if the phosphorous is low or if the pH needs to be adjusted to get to 6.5 - 7 (the ideal pH for tomatoes). If the pH needs adjusting or the phosphorous is low, there will be recommendations on actions you can take to amend your soil to address these issues.

  - I have to say that personally I have never heard of a pot like you describe for home use. That said there may be one but I am not familiar with it. The problem also is there is no research base that I am aware of for how you would heat the tomatoes and then process them to make the sauce safe. There are several methods of cooking your sauce that help reduce the moisture level you might like to try. For smaller quantities you can use your microwave and bring the tomatoes to a boil and then reduce the heat to lets say about 30 percent (defrost setting) and continue cooking to thicken the product to your liking. It won't scorch in the microwave, but you might cover it with a paper towel to prevent spattering. Another way is to cook your tomatoes in a steam juicer. This will reduce the moisture in your tomatoes and the clear liquid that comes from the tomatoes makes great soup stock. Another suggestion is the slow cooker on low with the lid ajar. Some people also cook it on a low setting in roaster pans in the oven.Hope this helps.

  - What kind of damage are you referring to when you say the plant has tomato blight? Tomato blight can be a generic way meaning the plant has leaf problems. Or it can refer to one of 2 different diseases. Late blight is most common during the summer and is triggered by rainfall which deposits wind-borne spores on the leaves. Early blight is spread by wind-borne spores that survive the winter on volunteer tomato, pepper, and/or potato plants. These diseases affect leaves in specific ways shown in the links, below.    Both diseases are held in check by warm dry weather. So, because of the recent series of consecutive heat waves here in the northwest, I wonder if the problem is due to something else. You might consider uploading several images when you reply to this email. The most useful are three: One of the plant and its surroundings; another of the plant, alone; and a close-up view of typical damage.   If one of the diseases is present, the most important thing to do is to remove and discard every bit of plant debris. (Do not compost it!) No need to remove or replace soil.   See Understanding Late Blight of Tomatoes (http://extension.wvu.edu/files/d/21601b2f-ce49-41ed-b046-c88196789ce2/late-blight-of-tomatoes.pdf) and Early Blight of Tomatoes (http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/fruit-vegetable/plant-diseases/early-blight-tomato/).

  - HelloYour friend is correct. Oven canning is not a safe way to can tomatoes and they need to be thrown out. When canning be sure to use research based recipes and processing methods and times found in updated Ball Blue books, So Easy to Preserve books, at the national center for home good preservation (just Google that) or any Extension bulletin. You can also go to the MI Fresh site at the MSU Extension website and find a good bulletin about tomatoes. I am very glad that you used eXtension. Sincerely Jeannie Nichols

  - Hello Dean, Even though tomatoes can be easy to grow there can be problems with them that can be frustrating. Based on your description you may have some sort of blight on your tomatoes. In addition to rotating your crops and destroying the plants at the end of the year, you may want to make sure you have enough spacing between the plants for good air circulation.Inaddition,tomatoes do not like overhead watering so you want to water them at ground level.  It's important to diagnose what's wrong with your tomatoes so that you can correctit. Here is a link to the CSU fact sheet on identification and treatment of tomato problems: http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/recognizing-tomato-problems-2-949/ Using a weed cloth may contribute to the problem if you are using the same weed cloth from year to year.Iftheweedclothisretainingmoisturethen both your tomatoes and peppers may be too wet. Poor drainage seems to be the main problem affecting peppers. Here is a link to the CSU fact sheet on peppers for your information: http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/peppers-and-eggplant-7-616/ I hope this information helps and that you have a bountiful crop, if not this year, then next year.

  - There are several possible reasons. I may be that you planted them later in the season and they haven't been in your garden long enough. Even though they are an early tomato, they still need 57 days to mature. It is possible your plants don't get a lot of sun. This also delays ripening. There is no cure. You just have to wait them out.

  - It looks as if your plants may have some late blight and edema. Both are worse during times of wet, damp days. There isn't anything thing you can do for your plants now. The disease lives in the soil. It usually takes about 3 years of not planting anything in the tomato family in that area to get rid of it.

  - I think it likely your plants have late blight. This is a devastating fungal disease that, within a week or two, kills the plants and renders the fruit unusable. While late blight is not common in Minnesota, it does pop up when conditions are right (cool, wet summer weather). The disease organism is the same one that caused the Irish potato famine of the 19th century.I'm sorry, but your tomato crop is lost this year. Clean out everything and trash it (do not compost). Next year, do not plant tomatoes (or potatoes) in the same location. In fact, I'd not plant solanaceous crops there for the next three years.

  - This appears to be a problem with a tomato spotted wilt virus, which has been more common this year with the dry conditions because it is vectored by thrips, which are often more numerous during dry weather. There is no treatment for the disease once a plant gets it, other than to remove the plant from the garden. The disease does not make the fruit poisonous but it should not be used for canning.

  - The blight is in the soil.  It is in all our soils.  You could try removing the soil and replacing it with fresh soil or perhaps compost.  You also can purchase resistant varieties of tomatoes.  Resistant but not immune to blight.  I would guess you have your tomatoes tied up rather than on the ground.  You should remove any leaves that touch the soil as the plant grows.  Water from the bottom, if possible.  Mulch under the plants. Here are links to both Early and Late Blight.

The acidity of infected fruits is often different than the acidity of healthy fruit . Acidity is needed in order for the canned tomatoes to be safe from food borne bacteria or other pathogens that can occur in stored foods. Hope this helps.

  - Thanks for the great photos.  You have a nice growing system there. Verticillium is rare in Colorado.... And photos do not suggest Verticillium wilt.  Do check a "worst" plant for brown discoloration in the interior of the lower stem.  Check that same plant to see if roots look mostly white or more black/brown.  It's possible that you have some Fusarium wilt; these checks will confirm. Even so, itmay be over-reaction to remove all the soil.  Just continue with crop rotation and use "F" varieties of tomatoes (Fusarium-resistant). It looks like you may have had or still have some psyllids on the tomato plants. These insects can cause some of the symptoms in your photos.  Look for "sugar"granules on leaves, the excrement of psyllid nymphs http://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/insect/05540.pdf   http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/recognizing-tomato-problems-2-949/

The most effective and cheap way to stem the invasion is to place secure wire cages over your plants.

  - I am afraid your tomatoes show signs of Late Blight.  That is completely different than Early Blight which just seems to affect the leaves.  Late Blight affects the entire plant including the fruit.  I am afraid your tomatoes will just get worse once they ripen.  There is nothing that can be done once it happens.  Fungicides have to be used prior to infection.

  - Blossom End Rot (BER) is a physiological condition that is often caused by environmental factors. It can occur in green or ripe fruit and will look like brown leathery spots on the bottom of the fruit initially, and black rotting wells if it becomes advanced. Because BER is not a fungus, it will not spread to other plants, but treatment options are limited. Prevention is key to combatting this condition. Take steps to ensure the reservoir remains filled and the plant has plenty of calcium. Early Blight is a fungal condition and can remain in the soil for a year or more. Perhaps previous owners had blight in that box. I would suggest that if at all possible you remove the soil, wash the box down with a 1 part bleach/10 parts water solution and then put in new soil. Otherwise, do not plant tomatoes in the box for a minimum of two years. Try beans, cabbage, carrots, etc.

  - It's really up to you to decide if you want to pull the tomato plants out now or wait a bit longer to see if more tomatoes will ripen. The season definitely ends when the first frost arrives, but as the day length decreases and the temperatures get cooler, the ripening process slows down considerably. Any tomatoes that are starting to show color can be picked and brought inside to finish ripening (unrefrigerated). Some people will pull the last green tomatoes and use them in different recipes such as fried green tomatoes, tomato relish, etc. You can search online for recipes to make with the last green tomatoes. ckc

  - We viewed your photo.  Animals such as turtles, squirrels, birds, etc. can be attracted to the fruit.  Once a hole is made in the fruit secondary infections can set in like a soft rot. Do not let the fruit lay on the ground where it may be easy to reach.  Pick the fruit at the blush stage and let the tomatoes ripen on your  countertop. There are no easy answers for controlling wildlife in an edible garden. Birds and squirrels - try covering the plants with a shade cloth temporarily to discourage them. mh

This devastating disease has been common in Minnesota this summer.  Please compare your plants and their symptoms to those shown and discussed in the following website.  Although tomato fruits damaged by late blight and anthracnose look similar, the former is more destructive and usually affects the entire plant.

  - Thank you for the question. Many gardeners this year are noticing problems with their tomatoes and one of the diseases that can cause quick death of the plant and tomato fruit is late blight, a fungal disease of particular importance during wet, cooler than normal weather. It is very important to bury or throw away diseased plant parts in the garbage. Next year, plant tomatoes in a different location. Fungicides can be used prior to infection when weather conditions that favor the disease are present. You can't use these now because your plants are already infected.

The nutrient level and quality of your product will be diminished the longer you store it. If it was processed properly and stored properly, is still sealed, it will be safe for a couple of years.

  - In 1989, the USDA did some testing on a small group of foods that were of concern to researchers. They tested home preserved foods and found that tomatoes and fish were not being canned long enough to prevent risk of botulism.To complicate matters, the pH of tomatoes (due to new varieties and better testing/technology of the testing) was broadening into less acidic territory of 4.2 to 4.8 on the pH scale. At 4.5, foods should be pressure canned. Tomatoes are easy to acidify, though, so we are able to continue water bath canning this garden favorite. The USDA adopted recommendations to add 1 Tablespoon of bottled lemon juice to pints and 2 Tablespoons of bottled lemon juice to quarts for both water bath canning and pressure canning. People with allergies to bottled lemon juice can use citric acid in each jar. The National Center for Home Food Preservation provides 4 styles of pack for tomatoes. You can see them and their respective processing times in Oregon State University Extension publication Canning Tomatoes and Tomato Products, PNW 300 (Revised April, 2015) on our web page: http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/food-preservation. The style of processing that you are describing looks like the Whole or Halved, Packed Raw without Added Liquid method. At 0 to 1000 feet altitude the processing time is 85 minutes for pints or quarts. If you are looking for methods with shorter processing times, there are two methods with 45 minutes for quarts (less for pints). These are on pages 10 and 11. The processing time of home canned fish was raised from 90 minutes to 100 minutes. Ball adopted the USDA standards in 1995. Kerr adopted them in 1996. Please feel free to use the publications on our link (above). They are free. In some Extension offices you can get hard copies, usually for a small printing fee.

  - Because of their acidity, unseasoned (i.e., no garlic or herbs), fully dried tomatoes may be safely stored in oil at room temperature. Refrigeration may delay rancidity. The tomatoes will soften more if quickly dipped in bottled lemon or lime juice before being placed in the oil. If the tomatoes are flavored with fresh or dried herbs and garlic they MUST be refrigerated and used within 4 days or frozen for long-term storage.

  - My first thought is, "Are you sure it is Septoria leaf spot?" It could be, but a more likely candidate is early blight. Both are fungal diseases and can be controlled using products containing chlorothalonil. This not an organic product if you are growing organically. I assume you are not growing organically since you are looking for something to apply to the soil to control. Both diseases will overwinter in plant debris so your first step is to remove all plant debris from the area - remove plants, rake out leaves etc. Both diseases travel from the soil to the plant via rain splash and then move around from leaf to leafby subsequent rain splashing. Your first line of defense is to cover the soil with a mulch of some sort to create a barrier between the soil and the plant. This will not eliminate the disease but it will slow spread. After planting, spray with the chlorothalonil product on a 7 to 10 schedule, especially before a rain. There are no products you can drench the soil with to eliminate the diseases. If you keep planting tomatoes in the same spot year after year, you will eventually develop other disease and nematode problems, primarily Fusarium and verticillium. Continued planting of tomatoes and tomato relatives is not recommended.  Ron Goldy

  - Hi,  It was not a great year for tomatoes. I think you should first have a soil test to see if there are soil deficiencies that you can address:http://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/  Because it was so wet, late blight was an issue: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/fruit-vegetable/plant-diseases/late-blight-tomato/ Epsom salts are generally not recommended. Research does not show much, if any, benefits of using this. I wouldn't add copper since you don't know what your soil is like. If possible, it would be a good idea to rotate where you're planting tomatoes. They are heavy nutrient feeders and quickly deplete the soil, so moving them to another part of the garden is best practice. Adding compost is always a good idea.

  - How to grow good tomatoes and where can I send a soil sample preferably in Salme.   Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert. Is your question about growing good tomatoes as well as where to test soil?     Tomatoes need good soil, lots of nitrogen and plenty of sunshine. Plant your transplants deep, you can lay them sideways and cover the stem to the first set of leaves. The plant will grow up. This gives the plant more roots as the roots will generate under the soil.   Water deeply once a week. If they wilt before the week is up, water again. A good all-purpose organic vegetable fertilizer will give the tomatoes all they need to grow. Trim out the growth between the main stem and side shoots. This will make the plant produce flowers faster.    Plant some early tomatoes and some later on in the season. Indeterminate tomatoes will give you tomatoes a few at a time all summer, determinates will ripen all at once and then they are usually done.    Rotate your planting area each year so you will not nurture disease or pests. Go to the various farmers markets and try different types of tomatoes to see which ones you really like.   Linn County Extension office holds a master list of all soil companies in our neck of the woods. Some are in Salem. Call 541-967-3781 and ask that they will email you a list. Choose a lab that handles soil samples for growing veggies. Good luck and email again if you need help.

  - When temperatures fall below 50 degrees, tomatoes will ripen better indoors than outdoors. Unfortunately, to get full flavor, tomatoes should be picked as they are just starting to turn red. Right now, our temperatures are warm enough to just leave them on the vine. That will change soon. Here is a good reference:http://www.uaf.edu/files/ces/publications-db/catalog/hec/FNH-00024.pdf/As for ripening, wrap individually in newspaper, store in a single layer, not touching, in a cool (but above 50 degrees) place, and check frequently. Wrapping them traps the ethylene gas they give off which speeds ripening. Warmer temperatures also speed ripening. So you have some control over how fast they ripen.

## 90964_Oregon

  - Thanks for your question about watery tomatoes. Tomatoes tasting bland and watery are likely taking up excessive water, especially during their late development state, whether from over watering or a heavy rain. Monitor your fruiting tomatoes need for water by scratching below the soil surface which may appear bone dry but shows moisture at the root level, water when the roots need water.  You mention that several of your tomato varieties were watery prior to the recent rain which also begs the question, how is the drainage in your tomato area. Tomatoes typically benefit from well draining soil, they do not appreciate "wet feet." Going forward, your tomatoes may benefit being in a raised bed area. Over the coming winter generously compost next year's tomato patch, this will encourage worm and microbe activity that opens up the soil. Also planting a cover crop in fall or very early spring will also open the soil as well as enrich it with essential tomato nutrients.

## 90993_Oregon

  - For the ones that are completely green, I would recommend placing them in a paper bag. This will help recirculate the ethylene gas emitted by the skin of the fruit which will speed up the ripening process. It may even help to put a single apple or banana in the bag with the tomatoes, as those fruits contain very large amounts of ethylene.Other options include placing tomatoes one or two layers deep in a covered box for ripening. Some people find better success by individually wrapping fruit in newspaper or wax paper and placing them in a covered box. Placing a few fruits together in a plastic bag has been effective for others. For higher humidity, place tomatoes up to two layers deep in a blanching pan or strainer inside of a covered pan with some water in the bottom. Make sure the fruit does not touch the water. Ethylene gas produced by ripening tomatoes is a ripening hormone. To speed the ripening process, place a ripe tomato or banana in the container with the fruit. To slow the ripening of green tomatoes, routinely remove ripening fruit from the container. Green fruit will ripen in about two weeks at 65 to 70 degrees F, and in about 3-4 weeks at 55 degrees F. Storage below 50 degrees F will give fruit a bland, off flavor. To store and ripen mature green tomatoes, put them in deep straw, wrap them individually in newspaper, or just lay them in a box so that they are not touching. Check tomatoes every few days and discard any that show signs of rot. Storage temperature should range from 60 to 70 degrees. They will ripen over a period of three to four weeks". There are many things you can do with green tomatoes. They are delicious breaded and fried, pickled, or even frozen to be used in soups and stews.

  - Hi, I'm sorry for a delayed response - the Educator that would normally handle this area of coverage has been out of the office.  A hot water bath method is an acceptable method to process tomatoes, but your processing time may have been too short and if you did not acidify them, that also can place them at risk.  The following are Boiling Water bath processing times for various types of tomatoes for Quarts:             Crushed:45 minutesWhole or halved: 45 minutesStewed: 20 minutesTomato sauce: 40 minutesTomato juice: 40 minutesThe National Center for Home Food Preservation (http://nchfp.uga.edu/how/can3_tomato.html) is an excellent resource for future reference. To acidify your tomatoes: add two tablespoons of bottled lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon of citric acid per quart of tomatoes.  For pints, use one tablespoon bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid.  Acid can be added directly to the jars before filling with product. It is best to re-process your product if it doesn't seal within 24 hours. In your situation, it sealed, but was processed incorrectly - and since it has been two weeks, it is best practice to throw out this product. Thank you for checking in and safely preserving your produce!!!

  - It does appear your plants have late blight. It is caused by a fungus like infection that rapidly spreads and causes decline of the whole plant. It is important to remove all plant and fruit waste dispose of in the garbage. It is unlikely to survive in the soil as it requires spores and ideal weather conditions. Tomatoes are disease prone and take a lot of nutrients from the soil. Because of this it is recommended you rotate the areas you grow them in. As additional precaution you can purchase disease resistant varieties. I placed a link below to an article on late blight.   http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/fruit-vegetable/plant-diseases/late-blight-tomato/

  - Squirrels are a serious problem for the home gardener when they start eating the tomatoes you were hoping to eat yourself.  The only 100% sure way to keep them away is to provide a barrier they can't get through or over or under.  Wire mesh with holes no larger than 1" placed around the plants and stapled to the ground or held down with bricks, along with the same mesh over the top will create a "cage" effect to keep the squirrels out.  It's a lot of trouble and expense to build and must be arranged so you can easily get to the plants to harvest the tomatoes yourself.  Other methods that can be tried are to provide a feeding station for the squirrels away from the vegetable plants (they love birdseed) and alternating repellent sprays (use one this time, a different one next time, being sure to apply as directed and to reapply after rain.)   Hope this helps!  Deb, Master Gardener Desk

Look for resistant varieties.http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Tables/TableList.htmYou can remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season. There is no treatment for the soil.

  - Green tomatoes can be preserved using the same methods as ripe tomatoes, but they are harder to peel.  All of our canning instructions are based on peeled tomatoes. You can safely mix and match ripe, semi-ripe and green tomatoes and different types of tomatoes together.    You might cook a batch of green tomatoes and test them to be sure you like the outcome before canning too many. They dont have the flavor or consistency of ripe tomatoes, so they may be best when used in a product with other ingredients (like a salsa).   If you refrigerate the raw pulp, I would limit it to 5-7 days. The enzymes in the flesh will continue to break down the cellular structure and give the product a slimy texture. If it is cooked, it should last a few days longer than that without becoming poor consistency or potentially unsafe if there has been some sort of contamination. You could freeze the tomatoes without any pretreatment (such as blanching) and then cook and process them when you have more time.    Here is a publication with complete tomato preservation instructions.    http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/sites/default/files/documents/pnw_300_canningtomatoesandtomatoproducts.pdf    This publication has a good recipe for green salsa that can use either tomatillos or green tomatoes starting on page 6.    http://extension.oregonstate.edu/fch/sites/default/files/documents/pnw_395_salsarecipesforcanning.pdf    Remember our toll-free, food preservation hotline is open Monday  Friday, 9 am  4 pm until October 13. 1-800-354-7319 if you would like more information.

  - Thanks for your question about ripening tomatoes.  Since many people use unripe tomatoes for cooking ("fried green tomatoes"), I'm assuming from your question that you want to harvest tomatoes that are still green, and not eat them until they have ripened.  Here's how NMSU differentiates:"Tomatoes can be harvested in three stages.   Mature green: Tomato is firm and fully sized. The fruit color is green to light green, with no pink color showing on the blossom-end. These tomatoes will store 12 weeks in refrigerator.   Pink: Pink color (about the size of a dime) on the blossom-end of the fruit. At room temperature, these tomatoes will ripen in about 3 days.   Ripe: Tomato is fully red (or mature color) but still firm. Ripe tomatoes should be used immediately." But here's a good articlethat addresses the "how." Hope it's helpful. Good luck!

The apples and the tomatoes will hold their shape better and probable stay lighter in color. With the raw apples and tomatoes they often become quite watery when frozen raw so you could end up with a watery pie filling.  Do a little experimenting and see what you like.

  - Generally when you buy a tomato you are going to want to look for varieties that are labeled "F2" which indicates resistance to the most common strains of fusarium.  Most tomato varieties and especially those with medium or small fruits do fine along the Front Range so just pick one that you like the sound of that has the F2 label.  Many but not all seed catalogues and nurseries label plants for disease resistance. One other thing to consider is that it may have been one of the tomato viruses rather than fusarium. They are more common in our area and the symptoms you describe could be attributed one of them. It might also be a good idea to select for resistance TSW (Tomato spotted wilt) andor TMV (Tobacco mosaic virus) which again will be listed in descriptions of the plants in many seed catalogues. Tomato junkies in our office recommend SunGold, SunSugar, Juliet and black krim, genuwine and generally they say that cherry tomatoes are more reliable.I hope this helps, please let me know if you have further questions.

  - Uneven ripening of tomato is often called green shoulders or yellow shoulders because the stem end of the fruit ("shoulders"} stays green or ripens to yellow due to sunburn or other conditions. Uneven ripening such as this is common in come types of tomatoes. Heirloom tomatoes tend toexhibit uneven ripening more than hybrid ones.Sometimes larger fruited tomatoes may be more prone to this than smaller fruited ones. Besides genetics, some conditions that may promote uneven ripening include hot weather, poor canopy (foliage) developmentwhich leads toexposure of the fruit to intense sunlight,occasionally deficiency of potassium though uncommon in Kentucky.an poor or uneven soil moisture. Best management practices would include stakingand tying plants so that the fruit is well shaded by the foliage; placing straw, leaves, or plastic film on thesoil aroundplants to ensurebetter soil moisture; and watering when conditions are dry. A soil test can diagnose issues with potassium.

  - If home canned foods were preserved using current, safe techniques, they sealed properly and they are stored at moderate temperatures (not allowed to freeze or reach about 95F) the contents should remain safe indefinitely. All recommendations that foods be consumed within a year or so are based on quality of the product. Even safely preserved products deteriorate in quality over time and after a year, the difference is usually noticeable. By this time,youwill likely notice changes inquality(color,texture,flavor)that maybeunappetizing,butthoseare notanindicationofthesafety of the product.   I am concerned about your note that you pressure canned pickled green tomatoes and salsa. As far as I know, there are no tested recipes for pressure canning pickles or salsas, the combination of the high temperature used for pressure canning and acid in a pickle brine would be very destructive to the texture of the product.

  - Thank you for your question. There are several options for tomatoes that will grow well in the Denver area. To determine what will work best in your situation, you'll need to answer the following questions:What kinds of tomatoes do you like to eat? I like cherry tomatoes and pear tomatoes, both of which grow well here. Sungold is a common variety. If you're looking to start form seed, most local seed stores or garden centers will have a good selection of seeds to choose from.Are you growing them in ground or in a container? If you're growing in a container, look for a dwarf or container variety. Sometimes they're also labeled as "tiny". If you're growing in the ground, you can plant seedlings towards the end of May to prevent frost damage. For in ground tomatoes, I like San Marzano Plum tomatoes, Brandywine or the Red Siberian. In seedlings, you can also find Early Girl tomatoes, and they do well also.When choosing a spot for tomatoes, keep in mind that you'll need full sun (8-12 hours a day). You'll also want to think about where your water access is. Let us know if you have any other questions!

  - Hello Paul, Thank-you for contacting us and so sorry your garden is suffering from tomato blight. Here are some recommendations: 1. Avoid nightshade family plants. The good news is that other crops should do just fine: peas (high nitrogen for soil), greens or a cover crop if that is your preference. 2. Hopefully, you did a good gardening cleaning by removing all dead tomato leaves. We suggest removing the top 2 inches of soil in the infected bed and put in garbage, because the virus can overwinter thus re-infecting again. 3. It would be best to refresh the soil by adding amendments: compost, worm castings etc. See fact sheet # 7.611 @ www.extension.colorstate.edu/boulder  4. To avoid future tomato problems this is great to read: Recognizing Tomato Problems Fact sheet : 2.949 for example spacing, overhead watering can lead to blight problems. "Since fungal spores can be found on plant debris in the soil, crop rotation is a management tool. However, this may not be practical in most small, home garden situations because a rotation plan allows no tomatoes, potatoes, eggplants, vine crops, strawberries, or raspberries in the same growing area for at least four years. In a garden bed, moving the tomatoes a few rows to the left or right is not an effective rotation." Hope this is helpful and please to call should you have further questions.

  - Thank you for your tomato question, Ray. You are correct in saying you started them too early. The challenge isn't so much the ambient (atmospheric) temperature, but the temperature of the soil, which should be at least 70 degrees, as this Extension article cautions. Although the soil retains heat better than air, it can be July before the soil is that warm. So, I'm afraid you will have them as house guests for 3 months more. You can start to put them out during the day, but ambient temperatures should be above 60, so you'll have to bring them indoors at night for quite a while.For next year's crop (or other vegetables you might want to plant this year), here's a link to an OSU publication that has a great chart on page 7 with starting and planting dates for each region in Oregon. It has lots of other valuable information for the home gardener, as well. Hope it's helpful. Good luck!

  - The most likely culprits are septoria leaf spot and early blight - they are the two most common tomato "blights". Late blight is a devastating disease that kills the plant and rots the tomatoes within a week. It is not common here (thankfully) but it was around last year.Prevention is the best option: don't water overhead or at night, don't work around wet plants, mulch to prevent splash up of soil, plant disease resistant varieties (and avoid heirlooms), space plants, keep them off the ground and on stakes or trellises, clean up debris in the fall and  rotate crops.

  - Growing tomatoes can be so rewarding. Yours look great, stocky and a healthy green. Tomatoes have large root systems. They are also one of the few plants where roots will form on buried stems. Repot your tomatoes when they are 10-12 inches tall into one-gallon pots. They should be planted in the garden when 10-15 inches tall, and when the soil temperature is at least 65 degrees. The soil takes longer to warm up than the air. Adding about a little lime to the potting soil will increase the calcium level - important to prevent blossom end rot. Harden off the plants before putting them into the garden over a few days by putting them outside for gradually increasing periods of time. Start with a couple of hours, then gradually add timeforseveraldaysuntil they have adjusted to the harsher outdoor conditions. To makethemostof our short season add protection when you plant your tomatoes into your garden. This can be in the form of hot caps. You can do this very simply using a plastic milk jug and cutting off the base. You can also use a hoop house - plastic pipe bent over the bed then covered with heavy plastic film, or even covering the tomato cage with plastic film. Remove when summer heat is here. Mulching at planting time will help moderate soil temperatures, reduce evaporation to help with watering, and keep down weeds.

A six-week old plant would be more ideal.Gardeners tend to start their tomato plants too early in hopes of early planting and an early harvest. But seedlings can grow rapidly indoors under favorable conditions and outdoor conditions may be less than ideal in mid-May. The result are floppy, overgrown plants that can be difficult to manage and plant.jt

  - HelloIt's important that you positively identify that Septoria is the cause.  Here is a resource from UW-Extension that provides photos and some more information:  http://learningstore.uwex.edu/Assets/pdfs/A2606.pdfThe fungus will survive on any plant debris that is in the soil, so treating the soil will not be beneficial if it is indeed Septoria.  Once you have the fungus, it's difficult to get rid of it.  It's important to remove infected material and destroy it, so it doesn't return to the garden.  Some additional suggestions include selecting cultivars that are resistant to this fungus.  You want to be sure that you are rotating your crops, i.e. not planting the same crop and/or plants from the same family (tomatoes, potatoes, peppers  are all in the same family) in the same area for at least 3 years (6 years is even better). Also, you can apply an organic mulch at a thickness of 3" around your plants. Be sure that it doesn't get onto the stem of your plants. This mulch will help prevent the splashing up of the spores from the debris in the soil. You might also try use of a black plastic as a mulch; with the black plastic you will need to use drip irrigation as the plastic will frequently dry out the soil.If you only require a few plants, you may also consider planting some in new soil in larger containers; therefore, eliminating the fungus all together.

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to several fungal diseases such as early blight and/or septoria.  Most likely this is what you may be dealing with. Go to the following links for photos and more information.  http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/early-blight-vegetableshttp://extension.umd.edu/hgic/septoria-leaf-spot-vegetablesetablesIf so, look for resistant varieties http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Tables/TableList.htmAlso, You can remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season. There is no treatment for the soil.See our vegetable profile on tomatoes for planting, fertilizing,etc.http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/plants/tomatoesmh

  - Hello,Viruses do not persist in the soil, but do remain in plant tissue, so unless there is a lot of tomato vegetative material mixed in with the soil or compost, removing soil would not be a solution.  Drying and wilting leaves are not a primary symptom of viral infection in tomatoes.Didyouhaveanyofthefollowingsymptomslastyear?From 'Common Tomato Viruses in Colorado' http://webdoc.agsci.colostate.edu/PlantDiagnosticClinic/quickfact/CommonTomatoVirusesinColorado.pdf:Early symptoms of TSWV are difficult to diagnose. The leaves may appear slightly curled with a purplish color to the underside of the leaf. The most common TSWV symptoms are yellow/orange rings on tomato fruit.

  - Hi,I assume that you when you drain them, they are the whole tomatoes before you start boiling and processing them.  If so, then they would still have their skins on.  If all of this is correct, very few if any nutrients are lost.  The skins are very tough and little would leak through them.  If you are talking about draining tomatoes after they have been boiled and the skins have been removed, it is an entirely different matter.See:  https://www.freshpreserving.com/crushed-tomatoes-%7C-canning-tomatoes---ball-fresh-preserving-br1149.htm

  - Leggy plants are a sign of not enough light. They should be under lights 18-20 hours per day. The lights should be quite close to the plants - not close enough to touch and burn, but only a couple of inches away. I would not recommend pinching off the growing tip. Instead, you might have to repot them into a larger container, burying the stem up several inches. Also, cooler temperatures will slow them down. But not too cold - keep the temperature above 60 degrees. And make a note for future reference: don't plant your tomatoes before April 1.Read here about starting seeds indoors:https://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/flowers/starting-seeds-indoors/

  - So sorry, that is very disappointing when it happens. They have a fungal infection. Neem oil is an effective fungicide.  Garden centers have fungicides for vegetable plants and the far from harvest they are safe to use if one follows directions and hand washing. Cinnamon can also be used with some success. It can also burn leaves. One thing to do to help prevent this next year is to stir the air over the plants with a small fan. Using a fan to create air movement also helps make seedlings stronger. Isolating the plants with symptoms away from those without is also important.

  - Begin by looking at our publication on Container Gardening. http://extension.umd.edu/sites/extension.umd.edu/files/_images/programs/hgic/Publications/HG600%20Co...You may be dealing with issues such as the size of the container, not enough sun, too much or too little fertilizer, type of tomato (indeterminate or determinate), etc.   You will have to look at the type of tomato you planted and how large they grow. If you are growing in containers, you may want to look for compact varieties. Take a look at our tomato profile for the list of types of tomatoes. For example, Indeterminate tomato plants have vines that continue to grow until frost or disease kills them. These include many of the standard, long-season tomatoes that are popular with home gardeners. http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/plants/tomatoesSpacing - plant one tomato in a 5 gallon container with good drainage in full sun. Tomato plants need at least 8-10 hours in full sun. They will be tall and spindly in the shade. If you do not have enough sun, perhaps you can move the containers to another area. Look at the above publication for potting media, fertilization, wateringandcareinformation. In the summer months, pay attention to watering. They may need to be watered daily.

  - Thank you for including images with your inquiry. I also appreciate the numerous details youve included about the plants and their care. Its certainly distressing when things go awry after years of success. Ill add a few comments then perhaps we can resolve this together.   The purpling of the leaf reverse is commonly caused by lack of phosphorus in the plant. That occurs if temperatures are low (below 55F) and/or if phosphorus is in short supply in the growing media.    Although your growing mix sounds as if it should work for seedlings, the organic fertilizers may be available at too low a rate because the soil organisms required for their use by the plants are missing.    If your goal is to use only organics, liquid fish may work better for now. If your choice is flexible, consider using a liquid synthetic fertilizer until the plants go into the garden.   The seed leaves often fail early in the process if a brief environmental glitch occurred. More often than not, its related to a brief water shortage.   The 3rd image is possibly related to an exposure to cold and/or to higher than normal humidity, the latter most likely coupled with low air circulation.    The background in the first image suggests the plants are indoors. If so, how close to the window are they?   Further, because the plants are leggy  a bit spindly  what kind of artificial lights are you using? Whatever they are, can you move them closer to the plants?

  - Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert.Yes, is the answer to your question.  The feces and urine from the cats contain microbes and parasites that are unsanitary for vegetable growth.  If the garden box is small, remove all the soil, really ALL the soil and replace it with clean soil. Aside from the health issues for you and your family if you eat the veggies grown in this soil, the soil may be unsuitable for the plants to grow in.  Heavy urine concentrations kill most plants.This question was addressed by the Multnomah Extension Office in Oregon regarding cat feces in an asparagus patch and here is their response: "The main problem with cat feces is the parasites that may also infect humans. Roundworms and other internal parasites can be present in the feces and end up in the soil and on your plants. Toxoplamosis is also a concern, especially for pregnant women. This organism can live in the soil for years and is known to cause serious birth defects. Children and people with compromised immune systems are also at risk from cat parasites.

  - With a few caveats, you can compost canned tomatoes. The bacteria that can spoil canned goods are anaerobic, so once exposed to the air, they will start to die. You want to make sure that you compost pile is "working" (hot enough), so that once you throw the tomatoes in there, they will start to breakdown quickly. I would bury them and make sure that animals or kids can't get into it and wash up really well when you're done. If your city collects compost, the tomatoes can go in there.

  - No.  Tomato seeds need warm soil to germinate and that wont happen until late May or June.  These plants would not mature and produce fruit before the first frost. You can start seeds indoors between April1-15 but they require warmth and light.  Here is additional information from another Master Gardener on growing tomato seeds indoors should you wish to do so next year.  If you plant your tomato seeds indoors under lights on April 15, then transplant them to individual containers as soon as they get their first true leaves, then grow them under lights, you will have nice plants to set out in your garden the third week in May. Most people get so anxious to start plants that they will start the seeds April 1st or even earlier. You can raise good plants by planting the seeds April 1st but I have found that April 15 works just as well or better. You will want to harden off the plants before planting them in the garden. Start putting them outside in the sun a few hours a day beginning about the 2nd week of May and they will be hardened off nicely by the following week. Tomato seed germination can be speeded up by using bottom heat. I have set the seed trays on a heating pad with low heat and have found that works nicely. The dates that I have given assume that you have a place under fluorescent lights to grow the plants, and have a daytime temperature of about 70 and night time a little cooler, with the lights on about 16 hours a day.  Dates for planting are dependent on the crop you are raising.  Seed packets give this information. For example potatoes can be planted now.  Corn needs warmer soil temps and will be planted later this or even next month.

  - Choosing a tomato variety to grow is a matter of taste, how you will use them and the number of days to mature/ripen.  The website below summarizes some of these factors.  Pay close attention to days to maturity as Illinois has a longer grower season. Experiment with several varieties.   See:    https://extension.illinois.edu/veggies/tomato.cfm   The following website gives general info on growing tomatoes:  http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/growing-tomatoes-peppers-and-eggplant/    Most cities have compost sites for residents.

  - The addition of compost annually can help to maintain good soil structure and nutrient content in your soil. You can add Tomato Tone at planting time, but if you have been adding organic matter regularly to your soi, a starter fertilizer is not needed. Post-planting, if you see symptoms of nutritional deficiency (yellowing, poor vigor, smaller fruits), you can apply Tomato Tone following the label instructions for the proper amount. You can scratch it into the top 1" of soil, or just sprinkle it on the top of the soil around the base of the plant and then cover it with a thin layer of soil or mulch to hold it in place at the root area. Tilling before a heavy rain should not have caused problems. You should not work soil AFTER a heavy rain, as compaction is possible. A good test is to take a handful of soil and press it tightly in your hand. If it stays in a ball, the soil is too wet to work. If it crumbles, it is fine to work in it.ckc

  - Often leaves will yellow because of overwatering. That is one possibility. The solution will be to allow the soil to dry out a little before watering. Another possibility is that the tomato plants are outgrowing their pot. Check to see if the roots are coming out the bottom of the pot. If so, it is time to transplant them to a larger pot. If neither of these help, please send in a picture. This may help identify other problems. Thank you for contacting us.

  - For tomatoes, if you have been applying organic matter (compost) to your soil on a regular basis, you do not have to add fertilizer. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/soils/compostThere is no special fertilizer designated for tomatoes. If you haven't added organic matter, it is fine to apply a fertilizer with balanced N-P-K. You can use a dry or soluble fertilizer at planting time and again when the tomato fruits are developing. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/learn/tomatoesFor the radishes, it could be that they are crowded or simply need more time to develop. Pull up a few and check the roots to see if they look healthy (white and fleshy is healthy, dark or chewed is not). Some types of larvae in the soil can chew roots, but it might just be that they are too crowded and need to be thinned out. You can use scissors to cut out some of the plants in the row so that individual plants are spaced 2-4" apart. This creates less competition between plants. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/plants/radishckc

  - I think you are referring to blossom end rot.  Calcium deficiency causes it, but several factors can limit a plant's ability to absorb enough calcium for proper development. These include: fluctuations in soil moisture (too wet or too dry), an excess of nitrogen in the soil, root damage due to cultivation, soil pH that's either too high or too low, cold soil and soil high in salts. Soil pH should be 6.5-7.0, you can get inexpensive test kits at most garden centers. If you are growing these in pots, you will need to monitor your watering and ensure it's consistent as pots will dry out more quickly.

The pests are often hard to find, the larvae are bright colored and the adults are striped.  Your plants may look unsightly but should stay healthy unless it is a serious infestation.

  - It is difficult to see what is going on with your tomatoes. It looks like you have moved them outside, which is good. More air circulation and sunlight is good for them. It may have just been a bit of a shock to them. Make sure that you let them dry out between watering and wait until you put them in the garden to fertilize them. If you just transplanted them now, they are pretty large. Transplanting is easier on the tomato when they are much smaller. Give them some time and don't keep them too wet.

  - Based off these foliage photos, I don't see evidence of a disease. I think the plants may have been in the containers a little too long and so the root system is too small to support the foliage. This warm weather has everything moving along faster than previous cooler springs! The purpling indicates a possible nutrient issue. The plant will likely recover and grow new healthy foliage once planted in a larger container or in the ground and fertilized. The rolling of the leaves is most likely a problem referred to as physiological leaf roll. It isn't a disease but caused by the plants response to environmental conditions. Some tomato cultivars have been noted to be more prone to this than other cultivars. The small root system will likely be involved in this as irregular watering has been noted as a factor. The plants will grow and produce just fine. New leaf grow may or may not show that rolling. the only thing that might occur is that the fruit is prone to sunburn since it will be more exposed than if the leaves were flat and blocking the sun. Susceptibility to sunburn will vary depending on the cultivar.OSU Extension has some resources that you might find useful:Grow Your Own Tomatoes and TomatillosA much longer publication on Physiological Leaf Roll of TomatoHope this helps and thanks for using Ask An Expert!

Basil, Sweet (Ocimum basilicum) Plant near tomatoes to improve growth and flavor. Garden lore suggests that basil repels flies and mosquitoes, especially in picnic terrace areas. Do not plant near rue.    TomatoesTomatoes like onions, cabbage, asparagus, carrots, celery, cucumbers, parsley and peppers.Deters asparagus beetles. Basil repels flies and mosquitoes and improves growth and flavor. Bee balm, chives and mint improve health and flavor. Dill, until mature, improve growth and vigor.

  - Monterey garden insect spray contains spinosad, a biological insecticide. It must be ingested to work, so the insects will actually need to be present before you make any treatments.Follow the directions for use on the label.  Tomato and tobacco hornworms both feed on tomato causing similar damage to leaves and fruits. The adult sphinx moths are large bodied, brown and gray mottled  and fly at night, so they aren't always easy to spot. They lay eggs singly on the leaves of tomato plants.

  - Hello,I checked with a Master Gardener who teaches a class on garden myths and here is her response.....No Epsom salts ever! Unless a soil test shows a magnesium deficiency in your soil (and it wont) you are wasting time and money. Too much magnesium can actually block calcium uptake, which leads to blossom end rot. Many people swear by Epsom salts - because they, and their grandma, always used it. The question is - what happens if you dont use it? You might actually have better results. Unless you have done a controlled study, you cant know. Side note, current research shows that fertilizing by spraying the leaves is not effective. The leaves are not able to take in any of the nutrients. Just water in at the base of the plant. Jeff Gillman and Linda Chalker-Scott have both written about Epsom Salts in their myth-busting books.Hope this helps.

  - I apologize for not being quite clear about that recommendation in the update.    Tomatoes for sauce and juice do not need to be peeled before cooking, since the instructions say to run them through a food mill after cooking to remove the peel and seeds from the pulp at that point, rather than before cooking.    USDA/Extension has no instructions that we know have been tested for tomatoes blended with the peels on. We are not certain if the presence of tomato peels, even if blended, will change the pH and pathogen load enough to make the recommended acidification inadequate. Because we are not certain, we must recommend against blending whole tomatoes (peels, seeds and all) for canning.       Tomatoes canned crushed, whole, halves or quarters, should be peeled prior to packing in the jars.       I hope this helps clarify that recommendation.       Jeanne

  - I do not think that it is verticillium wilt.  This particular variety of tomato is advertised as being verticillium wilt resistant, I had a similar problem as your's last summer with several of my tomatoes.  I finally tracked this down as being caused by curly top virus.  This virus leadsto leaf curling.  It is carried to the plant by a very small insect called a leaf hopper.  It is difficult to see this small insect on your plant but it is most likely there.Although there is no cure for this virus, what I did with my infected tomatoes was to remove the curled leaves and ultimately the tomatoes did well.  You may want to try this as long as you don't end up removing a majority of the leaves.  Also in my case I did this very soon after I observed the curled leaves.  I don't know if this would apply in your case.You may want to consult the following:https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/treating-curly-top-virus.htmGood Luck!!

Without knowing much more about the plant (pot or in ground? fertilized when planted? watering schedule? variety? when transplanted? and so on) I can't tell you much more than that. If you think water has not been an issue, you might make an application of a water-soluble garden fertilizer right now.

  - Growing tomatoes can be economical and fun, but it can be frustrating when the plants develop problems. Many times it is disease related but occasionally it is due to growing conditions. Keep in mind these may occur on peppers, too. This is a common disorder called blossom end rot. It is caused by a calcium deficiency with-in the fruit.   Pick anddiscardallaffectedfruittoallowtheplant to keepproducingbloomsandnewfruit. Blossom End Rot - The bottom of fruit develops a brown leathery skin. This is due to a calcium deficiency during fruit development. Generally the problem is not insufficient soil calcium levels but rather inadequate soil moisture preventing calcium delivery to the plant. Consistent irrigation is the control. Mulching the plants will help with soil moisture consistency.

  - Leaf roll in tomatoes can have several causes, either disease related or from environmental factors. If the cause is disease related, viral or insect the leaves should show signs, like holes from insects, thickening of the leaves, color changes or other sign of leaf abnormality. If the cause is physiological the leaves will be of normal form and color, just rolled up.  Physiological leaf roll is seen most often in the transition from spring to summer. Here in the Portland area our springs are normally cool and wet (certainly this year), but periodically we get very warm days. The plants should recover and have normal crops.   To help the plants recover give consistent, deep and infrequent water. Water deeply with a soaker hose, drip, or hose on a very slow drip for 1-2 hours once a week. Tomatoes have deep extensive roots and the water needs to get down 8-10 inches to the root area. Well-drained soils are also very important for tomatoes. Giving the correct amount of fertilizer, not too much, helps because you don't get the soft overgrowth of the new leaves. Avoid severe pruning and maintain the temperatures below 95. The ideal temperature range for tomatoes is 65-85. Indeterminate tomatoes have a stronger tendency to leaf roll than indeterminate. This article gives more information, Physiological Leaf Roll in Tomatoes  http://cru.cahe.wsu.edu/CEPublications/PNW616/PNW616.pdf.

  - The tomato appears to have suffered herbicide damage. Tomatoes are very sensitive to 2,4-D, dicamba, and other growth regulator-type herbicides. 2,4-D and dicamba are commonly applied to lawns to control broadleaf weeds. These materials can drift a considerable distance in hot weather.

## 101325_Texas
* askextension_tomato/101325_Texas
  - Lack of fruit set on a tomato can be due to a number of causes. When summer arrives and daytime (&gt;85 degrees) and nighttime (&gt;70 degrees) temps both go up many tomato varieties fail to set. Likewise, cool nights (&lt;55 degrees) also promotes blossom drop. That said, it is a bit early for your plants to not be setting due to heat. Relative humidity can also be a factor with humidity either below 40 percent or above 70 percent (welcome to Houston!) having a potentially detrimental effect on pollination. Excessive nitrogen levels have been associated with poor bloom set. Tomatoes are 98% of the time self pollinated as pollen within a bloom falls onto the female receptive structures in that same bloom. Therefore, a lack of pollination, can occur when plants are growing in an environment where wind doesn't shake them or bees don't visit and shake the blooms, such as an enclosed greenhouse.

  - This looks to us like physiological damage, not something caused by a disease or nutritional problem. It is possible that there was damage by cold injury or insects when the leaves were in bud. Continue to monitor the plant and see if healthy new foliage develops. Many times tomato plants can "grow out" of some problems that can occur early in the season.ckc

  - It may be some fertility issue, but it could also be a little bit of transplant shock. Did you add any fertilizer when planting? What I would do is remove the lower leaves that are yellowing and then mound up soil around the base of the plant. I'm making an assumption that these are not grafted tomatoes (you would know if they were grafted.) tomatoes are one of the plants that you don't need to worry about planting at the depth of the soil in the pot. all those little hairs on the stem will turn into roots if covered with soil. the next thing I would do is use a little tomato fertilizer to ensure the plant has enough nitrogen. I see some blossoms on your plants. I would be pinching those off, because you want your plants big enough to produce lots of fruit. I know you may want to be the first on your block to harvest tomatoes, but you can manage that by pinching back on some of the fruit set in a couple of weeks. Your plant needs more leaves which produce the food for the fruit. You have to have enough leaves to create those fruits.

  - Thank you for your question. It is difficult to see the anomalies with great detail, but the irregular growth appear similar to the herbicide damage photographed in this Extension article (page 4).

  - It is quite possible that you have the beginnings of early blight. It is super common in our area, especially in wet seasons.There are multiple suggestions for management. Here is a page which discusses this: http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/early-blight-vegetablesOnce the plants are established some people remove most of the bottom leaves to slow the progression down. There is no flat out cure once it has begun, but it can often be managed. Lay a mulch of shredded leaves, dried grass clippings, or newspaper covered with straw under plants. Pick fruits regularly and quickly remove infected fruits. Avoid contact between soil and fruit. Avoid overhead watering during humid, cloudy weather. Remove all plant residue at the end of the growing season. Infected reside can be composted at sustained high temperatures- greater than 120 F. Otherwise, residues should be bagged up and discarded as garbage.cm

  - Indeterminate tomatoes can get a little unwieldy. Although the availability of a taller cage may be questionable there may be some other options. Consider string trellising. Another alternative is to use cattle (live stock panels 4ft x 16ft) Take two panels and bent them in half and attach them together to get a 2ft x 2ft x 16 ft tomato cage. Also, give a thought to horizontal trellising.   I hope this is helpful.

  - The plants in the photos you sent appear to have herbicide damage. This would occur if there was weed killer sprayed nearby or is a lawn service did treatment near your vegetable beds. It would also occur if your manure were too fresh. Manure that has not composted well will give plants an overabundence of nitrogen and can burn plants. You state that other plants are okay so I am not sure this is the case. You may have to start with fresh vegetables.

  - Physiological Leaf RollCausePhysiological response to fairly extreme changes in soil water levels. This does not affect fruit yield or quality. this is often in response to temperature swings or soil quality (holds too much or too little water.)SymptomsThe edges of many but not all leaves on affected plants roll upward and inward, sometimes the leaf sides touch or overlap. The leaf rolling can be transient or may persist throughout the rest of the growing season.Cultural control is to maintain a well-timed irrigation schedule that prevents over-drying and overly-wet soils. Most tomatoes require at least 4 gallons of soil and standard ones prefer 8. If the soil itself is the culprit, you may need to repot the tomatoes.The cucumber could also be having soil problems. The browning may be excess fertilizer (salts) or insufficient water retention. However, this one could also be a fungal or bacterial problem. The mosre likely from your picture is angular leaf spot caused by the bacteria Pseudomonas. I noted water-soaked looking centers on some of the newer lesions, so this is the likely problem. If this is the case, your best course is to start a new pot with fresh potting soil and plant a new cucumber. this one is rather stunted, so in any case it will probably not be very productive.

  - The discoloration on the leaf margins may be a result of the spike in temperatures we saw a few weeks ago where the plant had trouble adjusting and staying hydratedso theleafsscorched.It also may be a symptom of a fungal issue called Early Blight, a common problem. It tends to start at the bottom and work its way up.

  - There are two types of "blight" that can affect tomatoes (and other nightshade family plants) https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-early-blight this looks like early blight. Spores from the fungus can over-winter which may be why you are seeing the problem, or it could be that your starts where infected in the first place, especially if you are seeing the symptoms where you purchased them. The primary spread of the infection is usually from water hitting infected soil and then establishing on the lowest leaves and then continued splashing just works its way up the plant.         The article I cited earlier has cultural controls. One of the most important is rotating where you are planting tomatoes in your garden if at all possible. I have a relatively small garden with raised beds, but I rotate which bed has tomatoes annually so I really dont see this problem. Removing infected leaves and using mulch like fresh straw around your plants can reduce the spread. The article has some chemical controls. Those marked with an H are available to home gardeners. In using any chemical controls, organic or not, please be sure to read the directions in full carefully so you understand how to safely apply them.

  - Your plants are in containers. You do not want to squeeze large plants in small containers as it affects growth and the root systems. A full size tomato requires 4-5 gallons and a dwarf 1-3 gallons. The pots are on bricks that will make them hot and dry and will require more watering.  If they are in full sun you may want to move the containers to some afternoon shade. Tomatoes are long season plants and may need to be lightly fertilized every two weeks. If the plants are in small containers, you may be able to transplant to a larger container. If need be, it is not too late to replant. Second photos looks environmental. Pick off yellow foliage.

  - First question has to be how big is your planter? Most tomatoes require the equivalent of a minimum of 5 gallons of space and 8 is far better for containers. The heirloom may not be as competitive as the other two plants. Leaf curling is usually a sign of stress.May may be root space, nutrients, temperature fluctuations or water (too much or to little.) A picture of the situation may help. You might want to transplant the heirloom to its own area if any of the above seem pertinent.

  - It could possibly be. It also could be early blight.  The spots on the leaves tend to suggest blight:  http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/fruit-vegetable/plant-diseases/early-blight-tomato/index.html  It is hard to diagnose without actual tissue exam.  You could try removing any leaves that show the browning at the edges.  Maybe that will stop the progression.  Or, you could just remove your plant. assume it is diseased and sterilize the pot with a solution of 1 part bleach to 10 parts water and then put in new sterile potting soil and a new plant.

One technique that I would recommend for next year is adding a floating row cover over your affected crops prior to flea beetle arrival. For this year, this would not be effective since you already have an issue. Other techniques you could use now would be to plant a trap crop or use organic insecticides. Be cautious if youapply oil-based products, and don't apply during the heat of the day, they can cause phytotoxicity.

That said, our vegetable specialist took a look at your photos and says:This sort of thing (the blackening edges) seems to be an issue with too much water or too much fertilizer. It is not a disease but rather some kind of osmotic issue in the roots, i.e., too much water and some cultivars react to it with necrotic tissue developing at leaf margins.

Pleaseopenthe fileaboveandreviewallthegrowingtips. Hopefully,withwarmerweatheryourplantwill setfruit. Andremember,beeshelp.Thanks,Janene Tomato pollination is temperature dependant. If nighttime temperatures drop below 55degrees F, pollen fails to develop and flowers that open the following morning will not set fruit. Cool nights often interfere with fruit set for early tomatoes and in higher elevations. Blossom set sprays help set fruit even with cool nights.  If the daytime temperature reaches 90oF by 10 a.m., blossoms that opened that morning abort. Blossom set sprays are not effective under high temperatures.  In July and August along the Colorado Front Range, night temperatures have a 50/50 probability of staying above 55oF any given night. In unusually warm seasons, tomato fruit set may be unusually high. When poor soil conditions and/or watering problems limit plant growth potential, fruit may ripen while small. With good soil tilth and water conditions, fruit size may be unusually large.

  - Hi, Oneway I know of to tell if a tomato plant is determinate or indeterminate is to look up the variety in a catalog or on the internet. The only other way is to wait until the plant matures and tomatoes ripen. If they all ripen at once and the plant stops growing afterwards, it is determinate. If tomatoes continue to be produced gradually over time and the plant continues to grow it is indeterminate. You can't tell just by looking at the plant in bloom which style of growth it has.

  - Yellow leaves can indicate many different problems in tomatoes. It would be helpful to be able to see several pictures of individual leaves and the whole plants.  If you could provide these it would enable us to more accurately assess the situation.  If any of the leaves have spots on them, close-ups of these leave would be especially helpful.  If it is just the lowest leaves, it could be either over-watering or lack of nutrients. Tomatoes like consistently moist but not wet soil. Maintain consistent watering as either over watering or allowing the plant to dry out between watering can result in leaf loss.The following site is an excellent source of information on yellowing of tomato leaves:https://www.veggiegardener.com/yellowing-leaves-on-tomatoes/Itisnotuncommonfortheolderleavesontomatoes-thelowerones-toturnyellow.For thetimebeingtheycanjustberemoved.What wouldbeofconcern is youngerleaves-theonesnearthetop-also turningyellow.Thismightindicatethatsometypeofdisease ispresent.GoodLuck!!

  - Hello, thank you for your question I believe that the bleach solution should be gone since you you rinsed your barrels and you probably didnt fill them until spring with new soil. Bleach solution will loose its strength over time as well. Since your planting containers are wood it might make a bit difficult to figure out how much water the tomatoes get, I believe the barrels might absorb some water. Make sure you check the soil frequently, tomatoes dont like to be overwatered or underwatered. They like lots of sunshine (at least 6 hrs) and warm temperatures. Fertilize every 2 weeks during grow period. Our weather has been a bit temperamental. This might be a contributor too. If you are concerned you could always send in a soil sample to CSU extension.

  - Tomatoes and cucumbers are susceptible to many pests and diseases.Preventative treatment is most effective. If you are beginning to see problems, Identify the pest or disease and treat immediately. Trim off infected leaves and remove from the area (be sure to disinfect cutting tool between cuts to prevent spreading disease). Avoid overhead watering. Scout for problems regularly (daily if possible). For the future make sure to clean up plant debris in the fall and rotate crops if possible.I hope this helps,

  - The wilts you list arenot your problem. Lesions and yellowing of leaves are the early symptoms of these and I don't see them on your plants. Take a look at our diagnostic tool "What's wrong with my plant?" under Tomatoes for more details on thesetomatodiseases.Ibelieve if juglonefrom thewalnuttree roots/leaves /fruitwasthe problem, youwouldseeitaffecting theentireplant.My first inclination is that the wilting stems may be damaged somehow from wind / rain and that is what is causing the wilting of these specific branches. Inadvertant contact while working in the garden can also damage the stems. Check the stems for bends, creases, breakage. Try pruning off these wilting branches and see if additional stems continue to exhibit the same problem. The rest of the plants in your pictures look very healthy.Your plant may also be heat-stressed or it simply is not able to support so many stems+foliage. Sometimes the stems are heavy and the plant can't support them. Your plant may also be getting too much nitrogen (N) due to manure or fertilizer added to the soil causing it to grow quickly and put on lots of foliage. Thinning the lower leaves / stems of the plants may help.Physiological leaf roll  - a tomato disorder - can look like wilting as well: http://www.extension.umn.edu/garden/yard-garden/vegetables/disorders-of-tomato/FYIsoil testingwon'trevealsoilpathogens.

  - No, your 'Indigo Cherry Drop' tomatoes do not appear healthy. It is struggling. This tomato is said to produce huge yields when grown in ideal conditions which include evenly moist soil; adequate fertilizer, and a minimum of 6 hours sunlight daily. (Longer is better.)   To resolve these issues, we need to play a version of 20 questions. Please answer the following questions and add anything else you think may be helpful and/or important.    But first, review Grow Your Own Tomatoes and Tomatillos where you may find answers before you reply to me. This free publication can be downloaded from https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/catalog/files/project/pdf/ec1333.pdf.    1. What is the growing media  soil; planting mix, or potting mix? If it is your own planting mix, please describe.   2. How did you prepare the growing media before you planted?    3. Have you used any solid fertilizer, organic or not? If yes, what kind/brand?    4. How long does the soaker hose run?    5. How do you check soil moisture content?   6. Why are the plants still under plastic?

  - Hi.  This looks like septoria leaf spot, caused by a fungus.  The best way to treat this is to implement cultural tactics.  Rotate your tomatoes (and peppers if you grow them) in your garden space, do not leave tomato plant debris in your garden over the winter, make sure there is good air circulation between plants and prune off the lower stems when you see signs of the fungus.  Be sure to wash your hands or your pruners between cuts to lessen the chance of spreading the fungus. If you want to treat your plants chemically please read the label to see if the product is used on tomatoes and treats septoria.  Please follow all label directions.

Since you did not mention it, I further assume that you were not growing your tomatoes in pots.If these assumptions are true, then four questions:1). Trying to recall as best you can, was there any thing, however minor, that you did differently this year as compared to past years?2), Did you start your tomatoes inside from seeds or did you transplant them?3). Approximately when did you transplant your tomatoes to the outside?4). Are you planting your tomatoes in the same location as in past year?Finally it would be very helpful to me if you could send some pics of your tomatoes, both of the whole plant as well as some closeup shots of the leaves.Thanks much.

  - Tomatoesare susceptible to several leaf spot diseases. This looks like a fungal disease, septoria leafspot.On leaves that already show symptoms, a fungicide would not be effective to control or clear up the problem. The best you can do is prune out the symptomatic leaves and discard them in the trash.

## 103429_Minnesota

  - The plant looks like it is not getting enough water.  Mulch is great for keeping moisture in the root zone.  But if it is touching the plant it draws water away from the plant.  I recommend that you trim off the lower branches that are touching the ground/mulch.  Pull back the mulch about 4-6 inches around the tomato stem.  (Check with your finger how moist the soil is.) This will allow water to reach the root zone more quickly. Between of our high temperatures and the mulch delaying water into the root zone, I think it isnt getting enough water.  Another factor is the white reflection off the house which increases the temperature and need for water.  Your other plant too would benefit from trimming the lower branches. Good air circulation helps keep plants from getting diseases. And if possible only water from the ground not overhead.  Did you fertilize recently?  Too much fertilizer if it is too high in nitrogen can slow down growth too because the plants can have difficulty getting the nitrogen. Overall there are no signs of disease that I can see and it is flowering.  No two plants perform exactly the same.

  - We think your plant may be showing signs of herbicide injury. Very small leaves, and the twisting and deformation of new leaves are common symptoms. The damage usually results from drift from 2,4-D herbicide. The active ingredient can drift a long distance on air currents before settling onto land. Affected plants very rarely grow out of the injury caused by growth-regulator herbicides.In some cases the herbicide causing the injury is in compost or manure that was applied to the garden. If you suspect that might be the case, please perform a bioassay to rule out this possibility.It's not too late to replant. If you cannot find tomato plants ask neighbors to donate suckers from their plants. You will need to water suckers regularly to get them established in your garden.jt

  - We viewed your photo. It is normal for the lower leaves to yellow and decline. Remove them. This may be more of a heat issue now. Decks are hot and this is a factor. Perhaps you can raise the container on some supports off the hot deck. We do not see a leaf spot however, tomatoes can be susceptible to several leaf spot diseases that cause browning and eventually moves up through the plant. Here is more on leaf spots http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/early-blight-vegetablesAlso, You do not want to squeeze large plants in small containers as it affects growth and yields.

  - The yellowing can be due to environmental issues and some foliar diseases. This does not sound like a Roundup issue.  It is normal for the lower leaves to yellow and decline. Remove them. Tomatoes can be susceptible to several foliar diseases. Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. Select disease resistant varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage, they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - Dear gardener,Thank you for contacting us. It is very possible that you are dealing with more than one problem. Is this the first year you are growing in this soil? Have you added any fertilizers or amendments to the soil this year? If so, what were they and what is the NPK content? We always recommend starting with a qualified soil test. Your county extension agent can assist you in finding local labs to do this. Soil amendments should be added only after first identifying the need (and the amount needed) with a soil test. If a deficiency is indicated, you can then add the appropriate fertilizer (organic or synthetic) in the right amount. Too much nitrogen can produce lush foliage at the expense of the fruit. However, if your cucumbers are getting lots of blossoms and small fruit, it may be a matter of providing a bit more irrigation. We advise watering deeply but less often. Water until the soil is moist to a depth of 2 inches, then wait until the soil dries slightly on the surface before watering again (assuming there is no rain.)With respect to your tomatoes, it is possible that they are not being adequately pollinated. Normally tomatoes are self-pollinating; however, pollination can be inhibited by the lack of wind and insects, as well as high temperatures, humidity, and too much moisture. On a dry day, give your plant branches a little shake to ensure distribution of the pollen within the flowers. And, of course, try to attract pollinating insects to your garden with plants that attract them. Broccoli and squash may just require more time. On squash, the male flowers usually begin opening before the female flowers. You can tell the females by looking for a swollen green bulge just below the flowers. From there, you can help nature do its work by "tickling" the inside of the male flowers with a tiny brush or Qtip, and then doing the same to the female flowers.

  - Thank you for contacting Ask an Expert for help with your tomatoes. Sorry for the problems with this usually reliable variety.  When tomato leaves yellow from the bottom of the plant, fertilizer could be the issue. You could try giving it a feeding of fish fertilizer (which goes to work quickly), and see if the plant begins to green up. Tomatoes are heavy feeders and should be fed with a vegetable plant food throughout the season.   Over-watering could be another issue causing yellowing throughout the plant. Tomatoes appreciate consistent soil moisture. However, if you are watering all the plants the same, this should not be the problem.   When temperatures get very hot, plants may slow down to conserve moisture, then get going again as temperatures moderate. In periods of low nighttime temperatures, blossoms can be affected, though I do not know whether Early Girl would be more sensitive to this than the other varieties.    For a comprehensive look at growing tomatoes, see this Oregon Extension Service publication: Grow Your Own Tomatoes and Tomatillos. Have a good gardening year,

## 104074_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/104074_Oregon
  - Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an ExpertThere are a couple of things you can do to help with the blooms. First you may need phosphorus to help the plant produce more blooms. When you go to the store to look at fertilizers, look for a liquid one that is for blossoms. They always have three numbers on the package like 12-5-5. For tomatoes you do not want the first number to be anything bu 0 or 1. That's nitrogen and it will increase the growth of the vine. The second number is phosphorus and will increase the blooms on the plant. Second, there is a spray that will help set your blossoms usually referred to as blossom set spray. You spray it on your plant. This will help the blossoms stay on the plant.The fact that you are not seeing any fruit might be due to watering, hot weather, lack of sunlight or wind. Water the plant to about 1 inch in depth, let the soil dry before watering again. Hot weather up over 85 will often make a plant drop its blossoms or not pollinate. Shaking the plant so the blossoms move can help with pollination. Insects are the best pollinators though. Too much sun, not enough sun are factors. Six hours of sun is best. Wind can be tenacious in knocking blossoms off.Try the things I have listed. If they are not working, re-contact us. Remember no more nitrogen. Tomato vines especially, like to grow and grow.

  - Early blight and Septoria leaf spot can be devastating diseases of tomato. Please read our website content and follow our management tips.The disease can overwinter on any plant parts left in the garden that don't fully decompose. It's also brought in on seed and transplants. Deep tillage will not help. Removing all plant residues is important. They should not be composted unless you are diligent in getting all materials in the pile to heat to over 130 degrees F. If your county permits burning it's ok to burn the residues. clean plant residues off stakes and cages.Space your plants to increase air circulation or prune to a single stem.

  - Blossom end rot is due to a calcium imbalance in the plant. It can be brought on by hilgh heat, too much or too little water, over-pruning the tomato, too much nitrogen fertilizer and a simple lack of available nitrogen in the soil.The following is from OSU.A localized calcium deficiency due to any soil or growing condition that affects calcium uptake. This physiological problem is common, especially in home gardens. Blossom-end rot often occurs when soil moisture fluctuates. If too little calcium is in the soil or if the soil is high in salts, calcium uptake will be impeded, especially under periods of sudden drought stress. Excessive nitrogen applications, especially in the ammonium form, can increase a plant's demand for calcium. Once calcium is used in the plant, it becomes immobilized and cannot be translocated from older tissues to younger, growing tissues, which need calcium. SymptomsA water-soaked, light tan spot at the blossom end or side of a fruit. The spot enlarges, becoming dark brown or black and leathery. Normally, spots are dry but may become soft if secondary bacteria and fungi invade the fruit. Affected fruit ripen faster than normal.

  - They look like aphids, which are sucking insects that are drawing nutrients away from your tomato plant. Aphids can be controlled with a strong spray of water that washes the aphids off the leaves, both on top and underneath, and drowns them in the accumulated water. Since there are eggs present or a few may be concealed, it is something you want to continue until the number of aphids is manageable.The least toxic of the chemical controls are insecticidal soaps, which can be purchased any place where plants are sold. Follow all directions on the container for the best times and places for the application and for personal protection.The following OSU article will give you some long term methods for controlling aphids with beneficial insects and companion plants: https://extension.oregonstate.edu/node/82676Thanks for using Ask an Expert.

  - Your tomato plant appears to be suffering from "physiological leaf roll".  This condition is the plants response to stressors such as heavy pruning, heat stress, water stress, too much nitrogen, root damage, among others. Although it looks bad, it should still product fruit. Some cultivars are more susceptible than others. Viruses and herbicide damage can also cause leaf curling but do not seem to fit with the plant in the pictures.

  - Tomatoes can be susceptible to several foliar diseases. Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. This looks like early blight.The fungus overwinters in soil and plant debris and can also be transmitted on seed and transplants. Early blight is typically splashed by rainfall onto lower leaves early in the season. The disease can spread during wet or dry weather but is favored by rainfall and heavy dews. The disease spores are wind-blown, allowing the disease to spread through a garden or neighborhood.Select disease resistant varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease.

  - Tomatoes are susceptible to several fungal diseases. Your photo is not detailed enough to determine which, but probably Septoria leaf spot and early blight (or both). In either case, it is too late for control, but in the future you can reduce these infections with a combination of crop rotation, careful cleanup and sanitation, good watering practices, mulching and air space around plants.

  - We can see in your photo that there are flea beetles present. The white spotting is leafhopper insect damage. The first photo shows that there is also some leaf scorch, probably due to environmental stress (e.g., too dry, too hot). If container-grown plants get too dry and stressed, they can become more susceptible to insect and disease problems. If you want to use an insecticide, you could apply neem oil or spinosad according to the product label instructions. Also, check under the leaves for spider mites, which like hot, dry conditions. There is information about spider mites (and what to do about them, if you see them) here on our website: https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/spider-mite-vegetablesKeep theplantswateredregularlytoreducestressduringhot,dryweather.ckc

  - Hello,It is hard to figure out what exactly is going on here based on the pictures. Here are some thoughts and things to look for.Sometime feeding by aphids can lead to a sooty, dark mold on leaves. Look for groups of small, green insects producing a sticky honeydew. The honeydew they produce can get moldy, giving leaves a sooty appearance.There are many fungal diseases of tomatoes. Some general practices help combat fungal diseases. First, keep plants well-pruned and weed under control, as both of these things reduce the amount of airflow, which can allow fungi to establish. Another thing you can do is change your watering schedule/style to reduce the amount of time leaves remain wet. Target watering at the base of the plant and water at times when leaves will dry quickly.Finally, it could be some nutrient deficiency. You could try a fertilizer with a broad range of nutrients to see if that changes things.If you notice anything changing, feel free to reach out and we can dig into this more.

  - Would you be able to send us photos of the symptoms you're seeing in your tomatoes? Pinworms could be a possibility. In addition, if you have any tulip trees in the vicinityof your vegetable garden, the sticky substance could be honeydew from aphids and scale insects feeding.

  - Tomato plant leaves seem to curl for a variety of reasons, most of which have to do with the temperature and environment the plant is growing in. If the soil is as wet as you describe this may induce the curling. If you can cut back on the water I think it would benefit the plant and reduce the curling.

  - Based on the symptoms we see in two of the photos we think your plants were contaminated by a phenoxy herbicide, such as 2,4-D. Herbicides can drift in from long distances and tomato is a very sensitive plant. Drift is the most typical way the injury occurs. It's also possible for compost, straw, and manure to become contaminated. You can perform a bioasay on your growing media to rule out this possibility:Unfortunately,yourplantswill probably notgrowoutoftheproblemandproduceagoodcrop.Trytofind replacement plantsatagarden center.The small white spots on the leaves in the third photo are caused by some type of sucking insect pest- spider mites, aphids, thrips, etc. No treatment is necessary. jt

  - It looks like Septoria Leaf Spot.  It is a fungal disease (see below for a link to a Fact Sheet on Tomato issues). Good sanitation will help. Remove diseased leaves (though too many can weaken the plant, so use your best judgment), practice plant rotation next year as the fungus overwinters in the soil. The fruit should remain unaffected, but at the end of the season, dispose of the plant, do not compost and remove all fallen leaves.

  - You are correct that tomatoes can be picked when they are just beginning to turn and allowed to ripen on a kitchen counter. This will greatly increase the number of usable fruits you harvest.Unfortunately, if a bite is taken out of an under-ripe tomato it is unlikely to ripen successfully indoors. Your best bet would be to cut out the bite area and then cover the wound with plastic wrap. jt

  - Tomato:It's difficult to tell from the photo but we believe the leaves may be infected with septoria leaf spot, a very common fungal disease. Remove symptomatic lower leaf branches. Increasing air circulation around foliage helps leaves to dry more quickly from rain and dew and reduces disease incidence, Water at the base of your plants.Cucumber:The symptoms are consistent with anthracnose, a fungal disease, although there are a number of fungal and bacterial diseases that commonly infect cucumber. The anthracnose lesions dry out and fall out leaving the impression that insect feeding occurred.Cornell University has an excellent web pagelisting the resistance of crop cultivars to diseases.Symptoms will continue to progress until the plant is no longer able to carry out normal functions Fungicide sprays are ineffective once symptoms are observed. They can only protect healthy plants. You can plant cucumber through the end of July. Growing cucumber on a trellis can improve air circulation and drying of wet leaves and thereby reduce disease incidence. jt

  - Your plants are suffering from environmental/nutritional stress. Some possible factors:crowding in the container, excess reflected heat from railing and other structures, inconsistent watering, nutrient deficits.Your plants have a heavy fruit load and the light leaf color indicates insufficient nitrogen.

  - In response to the wilting and browning on your tomato plants, they probably have an early blight. The recommendation is to cut off the affected leaves so it does not spread. Make sure to keep them fertilized at least once a month during growing season. As to the pinpoint holes in the leaves, those are probably caused by flea beetles. Those will not be a problem for the mature plant. This has been a very hot season and has negatively affected many vegetables.

## 105033_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/105033_Colorado
  - Hello,This is likely blossom end rot, which is a calcium deficiency caused by inefficient watering--too much or too little. Tomatoes need consistent moisture once they start to flower and fruit. Calcium is an immobile nutrient and needs water to move. So it's not advised that you add calcium, but it is advised that you adjust your watering practices. We often see this after we have a series of rain events. So much moisture often water-logs the soil and then the gardener doesn't water following the rain (because the soil is saturated). This is where the too much-too little becomes a factor.The tomatoes are still edible and will ripen. You can remove the blackened portion of the tissues. But it's probably best to remove the fruit.Here's some more information: http://planttalk.colostate.edu/topics/insects-diseases/1471-blossom-end-rot/

## 105050_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/105050_Michigan
  - There are 3 main reasons for blossom end wilt. 1.Too much nitrogen: ties up the calcium so that the plant cannot absorb it. I am not sure why you are adding fish emulsion which is mainly nitrogen.2. incorrect ph. Optimal ph for tomatoes is 6.5-6.8. Just short of neutral (7.)3. uneven moisture... wet followed by completely drying out.I would stop the fish emulsion and go back to Tomato Tone which is formulated specially for tomatoes and follow application directions.To test if you are watering correctly, at the end of the day, dig down 8" and check if the soil is moist (not wet).To check for ph and also to get an analysis of your soil nutrients, you could order a Home and Garden test from MSU. Available through the internet or at the Kent County extension office.You can also get a ph test at several garden centers (call ahead to make sure they offer it.)

  - Your images clearly show that your tomatoes have been affected by herbicide (weed killer).    Such damage can occur in several different ways:   (1) Herbicide was sprayed nearby, possibly even next door. Spray readily moves with a light breeze and can damage sensitive plants such as grapes and tomatoes; (2) The tomatoes were sprayed for either insects or disease but was applied with equipment which had previously been used for weed killer. (Unfortunately, the residue never washes out completely.); (3) Herbicide carryover in organic matter such as manure, composted or not.   Herbicide carryover may occur in manures. It is well explained in this Q&amp;A written for gardeners and farmers shortly after the problem was first described in 2005. (https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/411/2014/12/Paper_Clopyralid_QandA_v10.pdf)    If manure (composted or not) was applied to the garden, you can verify if it is the source of the distortion with a simple bio-assay in which you plant a few seeds (radishes or peas) and wait to see if they sprout; if they do, are the plants normal? (Details of the bio-assay are here https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/411/2014/12/PDF_Clopyralid_Bioassay.pdf.)

  - Curling is either a response to herbicide exposure or a combination of too much and too little water. Because your leaves are not showing any yellow or bleaching, we can rule out herbicide exposure. Tomatoes are very susceptible to herbicide so drift from a neighboring source can cause trouble.The last very hot dry days could have contributed to irregular watering. A period without and then too much.I am assuming that your pot has a drainage hole.You could invest in an inexpensive water meter, a small device that you stick in the soil to tell how much moisture this here. You would want to water when the meter shows on the dry side but not let the soil become bone dry.The new leaves should not curl if the watering issue is resolved.

Also, tomatoes are susceptible to some leaf spot diseases. This looks like septoria, a leaf spot on the tomato foliage. On leaves that already show symptoms, a fungicide would not be effective to control or clear up the problem. The best you can do is prune out the symptomatic leaves and discard them in the trash.

  - Septoria leaf spot is a persistent problem. In a typical home vegetable garden, there is not enough area for rotations to be effective in avoiding the disease. It is spread by spores that are airborne. The pathogen can be brought in on transplants or spread in the wind. There is nothing curative for Septoria. The best you can do is try to manage it. Prune out the symptomatic leaves and discard them in the trash. Provide adequate spacing between plants to allow for good air circulation. Put mulch at the base of tomato plants and water them at the base rather than overhead. Read our information on Septoria leaf spot for additional management recommendations. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/septoria-leaf-spot-vegetablesCornell University lists two types of slicing tomatoes that are resistant to Septoria leaf spot, Iron Lady F1 and Stellar F1. These are two varieties that you could try.

  - It looks like your plant has septoria leaf spot or early blight (or both). These diseases are common on tomato plants in Minnesota. They are worse some years than others. These fungal diseases are in the soil and the soil splashes up onto the plants.Prevention is the best way to deal with these diseases. Don't water overhead or at night (I see a soaker hose in the photo, which is good). Keep the plants off the ground by staking them (it looks like yours are sprawling on the ground). Mulch around them to keep rain from splashing up. Provide plenty of air circulation around the plants by pruning off suckers and staking them. Don't work around them when they are wet. Clean out the debris in the fall, and don't compost it. Don't plant tomatoes in the same spot year after year.

  - Had you noticed if water was puddling near the base of your plants during the recent heavy rains? Saturated soil can result in lack of oxygen to the roots. Entire plants can collapse like this in too much water. There could be other causes too - fusarium and verticillium wilt, as well as bacterial blight and Southern blight, can produce a similar symptom in tomatoes. Keep an eye on the plants for about a week and see if there are any signs of recovery. If there is not, all you can do is pull them out, unfortunately.

  - Birds and sometimes squirrels can cause this type of damage to tomato fruits. If this becomes a persistent problem and you don't want to use screening fabric to protect the fruits, you could pick the tomatoes earlier. Harvest as soon as the tomatoes begin to show their color and allow them to ripen fully on a countertop inside. The symptom of purplish coloring in the leaves can be an indicator of phosphorus deficiency. We typically recommend fertilizing tomatoes when they first start developing fruits. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/learn/tomatoesThe insects on the leaf are stinkbug nymphs.

  - It sounds like your tomatoes have blossom end rot. This is caused by a calcium deficiency which is related to uneven soil moisture.  Try to keep a consistent level of moisture in your soil to help prevent this.   It is best to rotate your tomato planting spots every couple of years also.  If it is a problem that reoccurs you may want to consider having a soil test in your veggie garden.

  - Thank you for the pictures which appear to show blossom end rot on your tomatoes.  As the article below states, technically this problem is caused by a calcium deficiency but the  real reason is that there is not enough water for available for the plant to transport the calcium to the fruit.  Regular, deep watering is needed when there is no rain. http://msue.anr.msu.edu/news/dont_let_blossom_end_rot_ruin_your_vegetablesRemove all infected fruit and watch for any further signs on new tomatoes. The rot does not spread from plant to plant or from fruit to fruit so no need to use fungicides. Always water at the base of the plant to avoid over spray onto leaves and water in the morning if possible, to allow time for the moisture that hits the plant to dissipate.

It occurs with erratic watering (dry then too wet, then too dry, with sudden temperature swings like the very hot weather we just had. In that case, the plant withdraws water from the developing fruit for its leaves and transpiration. This causes the death of the cells at the blossom end of the tomato. If the tomatoes are almost ripe, pick, trim off the bad and eat. If they are still quite green, you can salvage the good part for fried green tomato, salsa etc.We tend to grow cold-tolerant tomatoes here so that acerbates the situation. There is a calcium foliar spray which can be applied to unaffected tomato plants which may help. The following is from OSU.  A localized calcium deficiency due to any soil or growing condition that affects calcium uptake. This physiological problem is common, especially in home gardens. Blossom-end rot often occurs when soil moisture fluctuates. If too little calcium is in the soil or if the soil is high in salts, calcium uptake will be impeded, especially under periods of sudden drought stress. Excessive nitrogen applications, especially in the ammonium form, can increase a plant's demand for calcium. Once calcium is used in the plant, it becomes immobilized and cannot be translocated from older tissues to younger, growing tissues, which need calcium.  Symptoms A water-soaked, light tan spot at the blossom end or side of a fruit. The spot enlarges, becoming dark brown or black and leathery. Normally, spots are dry but may become soft if secondary bacteria and fungi invade the fruit. Affected fruit ripen faster than normal.

  - It looks like initially this was caused by a caterpillar. However, the damage could also been worsened by other animals (beetles, small rodents, etc.) feeding further on the damaged area of the fruit. If you can reply with any pictures of insects or animals, we can be more specific.If possible, try covering the plants with cheesecloth or netting or screen them with hardware cloth (sturdy mesh with 1/4" square holes). Move the plants onto a deck or on top of a table that might deter any secondary feeders.

  - I think what you are seeing is a disease called bacterial speck. it affects both peppers and tomatoes and is caused by the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris pv. vesicatoria. It can spread easily during watering, from splashing water and can be transferred by mechanical means (tools, handling infected plant parts). Sanitation is important for controlling it-it can survive in soil on plant residues that did not decompose. It can also be seed transmitted if seed for infected plants is used.

  - We looked at your photos and this looks like it may be bird or squirrel damage.

## 106448_Maryland
* askextension_tomato/106448_Maryland
  - Tomatoes can split when environmental conditions (drought followed by heavy rain or watering) encourage rapid growth during ripening. Some cracks may be deep, allowing decay organisms to enter the fruit and cause fruit rot. Remove the split fruit. Harvest your tomatoes as soon as they turn color and allow them to ripen on your kitchen counter. This helps to avoid critter, insect, disease, and environmental issues. Tomatoes are susceptible to several foliar diseases. Two common foliar diseases are early blight and septoria but it does not matter which disease it is because the management is the same. Select disease resistant varieties, remove the lower leaves to slow the upward spread of the disease, keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing, water at the base of the plants, provide adequate spacing, and spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) early in the season to lessen the spread of the disease. Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage, they are not curatives. Remove infected plant material at the end of the season.

  - What you are experiencing is called Blossom End Rot. Tomatoes sometimes have a hard time in pots. You need to be consistent in watering. Do not over water; soil should not stay sopping wet. Pots need good drainage. On the other end, do not allow the plants to dry out (leaves will droop from that as well as over watering). I would discontinue the Miracle Grow and instead invest in a product meant for Blossom End Rot or use a tomato fertilizer with a large amount of calcium. There is a granular organic fertilizer called Tomato Tone that slowly dissolves but contains a good amount of calcium. Granular fertilizers are only applied a couple times or so a season, once when planting and again about this time. Both should be available at your garden center.

  - We suspect that your tomato is suffering from a fungal disease called Early Blight. It usually affects lower leaves first and moves up. Pick off the diseased leaves but be careful not to scatter the fungal spores to uninfected leaves. Also take care to not splash water on the leaves when you are watering and plant(nextyear)so that they have good air circulation.

  - Thank you for using Ask an Expert for help with your mutant tomatoes. Well, they are probably not actual mutants.   I believe that your tomatoes are experiencing catfacing. I have included photos of this phenomenon for comparison.    There is little definitive research into this issue; but it has been connected with several environmental conditions that your garden may be experiencing. Under conditions of extreme heat, pollination of the flowers is disturbed, the production of natural plant hormones is disrupted, and the resulting fruit do not develop normally. When the vines are exposed to a wide difference in day and night temperatures, a similar effect occurs.    Other associations with catfacing are heavy pruning of the vines, high levels of nitrogen fertilizer, severe drought, and indeterminate varieties (Stupice is one of these).   Feel free to eat these weather-affected tomatoes. The fruit value is not reduced, though it can be difficult to recover some around the deformation.   Have a good gardening year,

  - Your plants are still looking pretty good and they should remain healthy enough for your tomatoes to ripen. This late in the season older leaves on the bottom of the plant will yellow. Pick them off and throw them away. Even if there is some septoria (a common fungal disease) there is no need to worry about treating your plants.dr

## 107167_NewYork

  - The spots are caused by a bacterial pathogen and unfortunately, there is no control for this. There are two different bacteria that can cause these types of symptoms. Based on the temperatures we have been experiencing, I suspect this is caused by Xanthomonasbacteria. This particular bacteria like high humidity/moisture and higher temperatures. This is generally a seedborne pathogen but can also survive on plant debris. Disease development is favored by high temps and high moisture. The bacteria get around within the plantings by wind-driven rain droplets and handling of plants (pruning, etc.). The bacteria get into the plant through stomates and wounds created by wind-driven sand, insect punctures or mechanical means. At this point there is no control. I would recommend cleaning up the tomato area thoroughly, leaving no plant debris and rotating out of tomatoes in that particular area for at least a year. I would also not save any seed from these tomatoes. If you have plants that are not affected, then I would cull the infected plants so the bacteria does not get spread to the healthy plants.

All plants need phosphorus (P) in order to create energy, sugars and nucleic acids.  It is late in the season now, especially for Early Girl as it is a plant that produces early but tends to shut down this time of year.  You do have too many plants in that area.

  - Black tomatoes won't turn red, instead they go from green to black. But the fruit of black tomato plants generally doesn't get completely black when ripe; it's usually more of a purple or maroon color.  There are other ways besides color to tell if a tomato is ripe--first,when youhold the tomato and squeeze it gently it will yield somewhat when ripe, and be firmer when unripe. You also might give it a sniff, since ripe tomatoes are morefragrant than green ones. Ripe tomatoes also feelrather heavy for their size. If still in doubt, just cut open and taste the most likely looking tomato, toseeif it's ripe or still needs some more time. Happy eating! Boulder County Master Gardener Desk

  - I see that your Willamette is growing adjacent to a thriving cherry tomato. Part of the difference between the two varieties is that Willamette is a determinate tomato which only grows to about 3, maybe 4, feet and sets fruits that average 4 to 7 ounces, each. On the other hand, cherry tomatoes tend to be rampant growers that produce abundant small fruits with unbridled enthusiasm!    Thank you for the images, especially the very close view of the rolled leaves because it reveals the lack of any disease or insects. More than likely, the leaf roll is a physiological disorder -- that is, not a disease -- which resulted from a combination of various environmental events this season.   Overall, the plant looks fine. Even though its described as early, its possible that this seasons excessive heat delayed fruit set as it did with so many other tomatoes.

  - Most likely your beautiful Roma tomato has experienced blossom end rot. The same thing happens to my Romas at times, especially the ones I grow in containers. This is not a disease but caused by a calcium deficiency in the tomato. This calcium deficiency is produced by an inconsistent supply of water, which impedes calcium uptake into the plant. Usually this rotting is visible on the outside of the tomato. However, in its early stages it starts inside of the tomato. Here is some information about this condition:   http://blog-yard-garden-news.extension.umn.edu/2016/07/prevent-blossom-end-rot.html  Unless the blackening is extensive, it is possible just to cut it out before eating. At least in my experience, the taste is unaffected by this condition.   Thanks for the question!!

  - Hello,If you aren't seeing leaves with discoloration and spotting, it is unlikely to be a disease that comes in with the wind (such as late blight).  My guess would be that this is related to the weather, plant nutrition, or your tomato variety. One thing thing to think about would be the weather conditions this season.  It has been a challenging summer for vegetables, with heat and rain either scarce or in over abundance.  We had periods of time where daytime and nighttime temperatures were warm enough that your tomato plants could have aborted their flower leading to no fruit. The plantscouldalsobestressedgenerally,loweringproductivity.Another thing that could affect plantings in multiple locations would be plant nutrition.  Tomato plants use a lot of nutrients, so think about if you fertilized enough.  Alternatively, if your plants are big and bushy, it might be that they are getting too much nitrogen, and cutting back on nitrogen will prompt the plant to slow down vegetative growth and it will start producing flowers and eventuallyfruit.Finally, think about if this variety is something you've grown before and had success with, or if this variety new to you.  One thing to look into is if the variety is determinate or indeterminate.  Determinate tomatoes are more likely to set one bunch of fruit that will ripen over a few weeks.  Indeterminate tomatoes will grow until they are killed by a frost, producing fruit along the way. For  more information and tips, see: http://www.canr.msu.edu/uploads/resources/pdfs/michigan_fresh_growing_tomatoes_(sp)_(e3174).pdfIt is hard to pinpoint the exact issue, but I hope this gets you started!

  - Hello,Loss of liquid from the jar may indicate that there was not enough headspace in the jar. Headspace is the space between the top of the food in the jar and the rim of the jar. Tomatoes should have 1/2 inch of headspace. If too little headspace is allowed the food may expand and bubble out when air is being forced out from under the lid during processing. Check to make sure the jar sealed properly.Another possibility is if the air bubbles were not worked out from the jars before processing. To remove air bubbles, run a plastic spatula or knife between the food and the jars. Also, if the food is packed too tightly in the jars, it can boil over during processing and start a siphon.A third possibility is if jars were not covered with 1 to 2 inches of water in the water bath canner.You mentioned that there was tomato stuck between the jar and the lid. If so, I question whether the jar is properly sealed. If it is not, I would suggest not using the tomatoes.

  - What you are observing is not uncommon in tomatoes. If striping is to occur, it usually does so during the latter stages of ripening. You can still eat them though the parts of the tomato that are under the yellow areas may be harder in texture than the rest of the tomato.   Uneven ripening of tomato is sometimes called green shoulders or yellow shoulders because the stem end of the fruit ("shoulders"} stays green or ripens to yellow due to sunburn or other conditions. Im not convinced that this is the case with your tomatoes since the yellow stripes run down most of your tomatoes.  Uneven ripening is common in certain types of tomatoes though I dont know how often it is observed in Jet Stars. Sometimes larger fruited tomatoes, such as Jet Stars, are more prone to this than smaller fruited varieties. I wonder if you have observed this in past seasons with your Jet Stars? Conditions that may promote uneven ripening include hot weather, poor canopy (foliage) development which leads to exposure of the fruit to intense sunlight, or poor/uneven soil moisture (too dry or too wet).    If you scroll down a bit at the following site, you will see what environmental factors might have caused this striping:   http://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/visual-guides/tomato-fruit-problems.aspx   It has been reported that poor uptake of potassium by tomatoes can lead to yellow striping. This is further discussed at:   https://extension.umd.edu/learn/tomato-ripening-problems-and-role-potassium   Related to potassium uptake, if you have not had the soil around your tomatoes tested within the last four years or so, consider doing this. Among other things, the test results will indicate the potassium level in the soil. Such testing can be done by the University of Minnesota. See:   http://soiltest.cfans.umn.edu/testing-services   Good Luck!!

  - Now that the weather has cooled and we've actually gotten some rain, adjusting the management of tomato plants is a good idea. If you want to continue to get ripe tomatoes you should irrigate deeply every 7-10 days. The water needs to get all the way down to the extensive root system. Using a soaker hose for an hour or two or using a drip system gets the water down to the roots without getting moisture on the leaves. As it gets cooler tomatoes, being a hot-weather plant, is susceptible to fungal diseases, like late rot, that moisture on the leaves encourages.    Since tomatoes like warm feet warming the soil to 65 degrees with black plastic will extend your season. You can also add a row cover or plastic tent when the air temperature drops below 60.    Pruning the plant, taking off the new growth and small tomatoes that aren't going to have time to ripen, will concentrate the plant's energy to ripening the remaining tomatoes. Tomatoes can be removed when they're semi-ripe (with some color) or just mature green and placed indoors to ripen. Temperature should be about 65 degrees.

  - Without seeing any pictures of the damage, it is hard to say what is causing it. My first thought is voles, as they are known to cause this type of damage, instead of birds. When inspecting the tomatoes, a clue to what is causing the problem can be determined with how the bite looks. Bird damage is going to look like something has been poking the tomato (think of a nail being repeatedly pushed into it) while rodent damage will be much more like an actual bite (starting on the outside and working in). Determine if the damage is happening throughout the garden or just on the edges. Throughout points to mice or voles while just on the outside could be woodchucks. Another clue for the culprit would be with the time the damage is occurring. Bird damage will be occurring during daylight while rodent damage can occur during the day or night.In terms of prevention, the first step is identifying the culprit. If it is birds, then raising the net above the plants will stop the damage provided the birds cannot bet through it. However, if the problem is more "rodent" in nature, then you may have to look at a trapping program to resolve it.

  - If the disease does not cause blemishes on the fruit of the tomato plant and it starts at the bottom it is likely septoria leaf spot disease.  The fungus attacks the leaves, and plants are left with few leaves and the fruit.  Fruit gets sunburned and do not develop will, since leaves provided protection from the sun and are needed for photosynthesis to give the plant the needed carbohydrates for growth and fruit development.Septoriasurvivesin thegarden fromyeartoyearindebrisfrompreviousyear.Itisimportanttoremovealltomato plantdebris and dispose of it. When watering tomato plants do not wet leaves. Water at base of plant to avoid wetting leaves which can spread the disease. Never water in the evenings which causes wet foliage through the night making the plant more susceptible to the disease. If this disease occurs fromyear to year you can apply fungicides registered for use in the garden, early on in the summer to management this disease.

  - When making salsa and the recipe asks for a quart of tomatoes generally they are referring to peeled, cored and chopped tomatoes. That is how they would be used in the recipe. The recipe you are referring to, with the past tomatoes, you would still peel core and chop any type of tomato. The paste tomato is used to make a thicker salsa. Less water more solid tomato is what a paste tomato provides. The long green chiles, if it is the same recipe asks for 4 cups seeded chopped, long green chilies. When a recipe asks for a long green chiles that is asking for a chile type pepper that is longer than most, however if you are canning chiles whole have them the size of the jar you are canning them in.

  - Hello,It looks like a virus, but you wouldn't know for certain unless you had the tomatoes tested at the CSU lab. The test costs about $30.However, if you've been growing tomatoes in the same spot in the raised beds for over ten years, it's time to move them somewhere else (crop rotation). Take any solanaceous plants out of that bed (including peppers, eggplant and potatoes) and grow them elsewhere. Tomatoes tend to do really well in containers.It's also important to plant varieties that are resistant to diseases--this one could be tomato (tobacco) mosaic virus.The curling leaves are difficult to diagnose. What have you added to the garden this year (or last year)? Do only tomatoes have these curling leaves or do you other plants?And obviously, the hail isn't helping matters--it can really knock back growth and it takes a lot for the plant to recover, especially late in the season.

  - Hi there, I have included a few links below that can hopefully help you determine what the cause of the black spots on your tomatoes are. Whether they are safe to eat really depends on the cause of the spots. If it looks like it is blight, then you should not use them to can, as it can reduce the acidity of the tomato, making canning them unsafe.  https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/michigan_fresh_tomato_diseases_in_the_home_garden http://www.canr.msu.edu/news/blossom_end_rot_understanding_a_perennial_problem https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/are_tomatoes_and_potatoes_with_late_blight_safe_for_eating_and_canning In addition, since you are new to canning (other than applesauce), here is a link to some great information on "how to" can, including a section specific to tomatoes.

  - Hello, If the jars are still sealed, use rubber or heavy plastic gloves, and place the contents in disposable containers that can be sealed and put them in a heavy garbage bag. Place the bag in a regular trash container or dispose in a nearby landfill. To clean the jars, or anything the contents may have touched such as a can opener, counter, dishcloths and etc. use rubber or heavy plastic gloves. Wash the jars with hot soapy water, rinse and then use a solution of 1 part unscented liquid household chlorine bleach to 5 parts clean water and allow jars to sit in this solution for 30 minutes. Allow to air dry. Then run jars through a dishwasher or rinse well and air dry jars again (washing and sanitizing not necessary the second time). Thank you for using eXtension Ask an Expert.

  - For the tomatoes to produce fruit, they need to bloom and be pollinated.  If you didn't have many blooms, it may be that you are giving the plant too much nitrogen (the grass clippings are a high-N source.)  What I recommend is that you obtain a soil analysis from A&amp;L Western Lab  http://www.al-labs-west.com/services.php?section=Soil%20Analysisfor the area where you plant your tomato plants.  The other issue is the heat.  Although tomatoes like hot weather, heat in excess of 85 F will cause blossom drop http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/hs1195is an article from Florida extension explainingthephenomenon. Although it seems a little counter-intuitive, you can address this by providing some shade to the plants using shade cloth.

  - Thank you for your question.  I'm sorry it has taken so long to get an answer to you, and you may already have canned what tomatoes you harvested!  Here's what Minnesota Extension says about this problem:"Growth cracks  Extremely fast fruit growth can cause growth cracks. This may be caused by periods of abundant rain and high temperatures, or can happen when it rains or you water water plants after a period of drought.   Cracks may radiate from the stem end of the fruit or may encircle the fruit. Cracks are often invaded by secondary fungi and bacteria that further rot the fruit.   Maintaining even moisture by watering regularly and mulching the soil around the tomato plant can help reduce growth cracks.   Varieties differ in susceptibility to cracking, and variety descriptions may be helpful in choosing a plant less likely to crack." So, as much as we think hot weather is good for plants generally, it can be a real pain with tomatoes. I hope this is helpful! Good luck next year!

## 110670_Minnesota

  - The tomotoes in your photo have growth cracks. This is not a disease but rather a growing condition. When moisture conditions vary it can cause cracks in the tomatoes. The best remedy is to keep water consistent without lengthy periods of dryness.

  - Your description of the process sounds correct.  Given that the headspace in the jar has changed from 1/2 inch to well over an inch and its less than 24 hours I would reprocess the tomatoes.  You can find research based, validated recipes for canning in the USDA Guide to home canning.  The tomato canning portion can be found here: https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/usda/GUIDE03_HomeCan_rev0715.pdf.  Another resource is the National Center for Home Food Preservation at https://nchfp.uga.edu/Generally in tomatoes that were placed in a pressure canner with correct headspace and suffer this much liquid loss from the jar is a result of a sudden pressure change. If the weight was removed before the canner completely cooled and the pressure had dropped to zero, that sudden pressure change would result in a loss of liquid like you are seeing. As for the foam, I have seen tomatoes have that before and following proper canning methods is not a cause for concern. If you would like to discuss this further and would like to talk, I can be reached at 1-434-645-9315. When reprocessing you will need to follow all the steps in the recipe leading up to placing the jars in the canner and then follow the proper canner venting, bringing canner to pressure, processing times for selected method, and cooling. If you choose to water bath, the venting and pressure do not apply.

  - Where did you get this Stewed Tomato canning recipe?The part of the directions where you boil for 10 minutes before canning them would be part of the processing time so it could potentially make the stewed tomatoes unsafe.However, what concerns me more is that you processed it in a boiling water canner. Some of ingredients that you listed above are low acid and would raise the pH of the tomatoes making them unsafe to process them in a boiling water canner. I found a stewed tomato recipe in the Ball Blue Book. It has similar ingredients to what you mentioned above and requires that it is pressure canned.Based on what the information you provided, it appears that your stewed tomatoes were not canned safely. If it has been less than 24 hours since you originally canned them, you can reprocess them. If more than 24 hours, you need to discard them. Even though the lids sealed, it does not make the tomatoes that you canned safe.

  - Good morning- Because most tomatoes have pH values close 4.6 (a pH cut point for Clostridium botulinum spore germination) the latest canning recommendation is to add 1 table spoon of bottled lemon juice or 1/4 teaspoon citric acid per pint of tomatoes before using the boiling water bath canning method.https://nchfp.uga.edu/publications/nchfp/factsheets/acidifying.html Below are some more information about botulism.

  - It was a tough year. Many gardeners scrambled to keep up with the abnormalweather conditions. We're not sure what you meant by the rains "overwhelming the garden." Did the raised beds have standing water for a period after the rain stopped? If so, you may need to improve the drainage in the beds by adding soil amendments to the mix. There are no tomato varieties that are bred for wet sites. There are, however, tomato varieties that have been hybridized to withstand high temperatures down south. (Very high temperatures kill pollen. Look for those when you order your seeds.

  - Start tomato seeds 6 weeks before your last frost date. Cucumber -  4 weeks or less before the last frost date. A general guideline for planting warm season plants outdoors is around Mothers Day. Be prepared to protect your plants with a floating row cover if a frost is expected.Do not start your seeds too early. The proper time to sow seeds for transplants depends on when plants may safely be moved out-of-doors in your area.

  - Shape alone is probably not enough to determine a variety/cultivar. There are so many varieties available today. In fact, in the pursuit of a better tomato, some will quickly disappear from the scene as improved tomatoes take their place. Another thing to consider is that the seeds from the mother plant could have been new cultivar themselves. A Michigan gardener, Joseph Tychonievich (https://articles.extension.org/pages/71122/joseph-tychonievich) wrote a book on Plant Breeding for the Home Gardener: How to Create Unique Vegetables and Flowers,showing how easy it can be.   The plant looks like it could be related to the San Marzano, Opalka , Super Italian Paste, or even San Marzano Redorta, indeterminate and longer maturity. If you want to continue with this cultivar, I would suggest you keep collecting seed, and limit cross pollination with other varieties.   I hope this is helpful,

  - Tomatoes will be much more difficult in your new environment than they were at 1000.  They like rich soil, but not overly amended.  Recommend soil test to know for sure. CSU can do this for you if you would like!   We have a much shorter growing season and tomatoes are very temperature sensitive.  Over 90 degrees by 10 a.m. and blossoms will drop.  Below 55 degrees consistently  at night and pollen sticks in tubes.  So tomatoes extremely temperature sensitive .  Will definitely need to cover.  Recommend finding a short maturing variety in order to successfully get any kind of crop at that elevation and perhaps something of a Russian derivation . You might try asking neighbors who might save seed which would already be adapted for your environment. Please let me know if there are any other questions I can answer for you!

  - Sorry for the delay, I have been digging out after having been gone for a week to warmer climes. You can guess what I was doing today!!!!Tomatoes prefer an acid soil:  a pH of 5.5 to 7.0 (neutral). Manure from poultry is a good thing because it increases the uptake of Phosphorus (P), Nitrogen (N) and Potassium (K). Tomato plants tend to produce more with poultry manure. I am not sure what you mean by "hot", but poultry manure tends to raise soil pH. It seems counter intuitive but manure in general raises soil pH.I would be more concerned about the soil where you are going to plant the tomatoes than the soil being "accessed by chickens". I recommend that you get a soil test done this spring.http://soiltest.dl.umn.edu/recommendations-lawn-garden and http://soiltest.dl.umn.edu/testing-services/lawn-garden The test will tell you the pH and the recommended amendments. If a soil test is impractical I recommend adding compost to the soil at a minimum . The bottom line is that you should be able to plant any tomatoes you want.

  - Tomatoes grown in containers are often more productive than those planted in the ground. Choose a sunny spot near a water source because the pots will need water daily, especially in mid- to late-summer. Plants grown under soffits next to south facing walls benefit from reflected heat and protection from rain. The latter is a plus because tomato leaves moistened frequently are susceptible to disease.

  - Hi- you're starting to see minor stress symptoms because they are overgrowing the 3 in. pots an need more room and light. The plants look quite soft- typical for tomato transplants grown under fluorescent tubes. It's good that you're keeping an eye on the watering. Let the top of the grow mix dry a bit before watering. Bottom watering is fine, of course. Since you are 4-6 weeks away from being able to plant outdoors (without protection) you should pot up to larger containers (at least 6 in diameter or 6 in x 6 in). This will allow the plants to grow healthily and develop thick stems.This may be difficult based on the number of plants and limited space under the light tubes. You could pot up and start leaving a portion of plants outside on mild days in a protected, shaded location and bring them in at night. That would allow you to keep a smaller number of larger pots under the lights. It's a lot of extra work but will give you large, healthy transplants when it's time to plant.Videoonpottingtomatoplantsupintolargercontainers:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9egyjT-3iJw&amp;t=14sLeaving the plants in the 3 in. pots will lead to more soft, leggy growth, increased physical injury to stems, and increased chance of damping off diseases.Next year consider starting seeds 6 weeks prior to transplanting.Jon

  - Are you sure they are squirrels? With any plant damage situation, you probably need to start by identification of the culprit. Then, assess your set-up. Are these tomatoes from last year's garden? Or are you starting tomatoes early this year in a greenhouse? Either way, if you are getting rodent damage, you will want to block the young plants from the predator until they get larger and can withstand a bit of damage. Squirrels usually do not bother green vegetation and prefer seeds, nuts, etc. I would be more suspicious of rabbit or deer damage. In that case, you need to protect your young tomato plants with tomato cage covered with chicken wire, or a similar blocking set-up. Once the tomato plant gets large, the protection is needed less. Depending on the amount of damage you may be getting to other plants, you may consider a more permanent large scale blocking technique, such as fencing. Repellants can help, but have to be used repeatedly to be effective. I would be more than happy to answer more follow-up questions from you if you share more details.

  - It is hard to change pH quickly and the measures work best when the soil has warmed up. Do not despair. It is doable.I am referring you to two articles. The amount of sulfur they recommend are about the same for 100 sq'. Note that you need to space out the applications so as not to burn the roots of your plants. You could make a first application soon, before you plant. Also note that soil bacteria will aid in the acidification process. Adding rotten manure or compost will help and add good bacteria. I would suggest compost consisting of some leaf litter. Watch the Nitrogen content of rotten manure and compost.

  - At your nursery or garden supply store check for plants that have resistant codes on their labels. "VFN" for instance indicates the variety is resistant to Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt and root-knot nematodes.  Varieties which carry a "T" designation are also resistant to tobacco mosaic virus, a disease which often causes problems for tomato gardeners.Varieties which carry the designation "VF" only are resistant to Verticillium and Fusarium wilts but not resistant to root-knot nematodes.

  - Hi Jackie,Without more information and a sample we really can't diagnose the problem. We would need to see the leaf. It could be a virus, fungus, or an antibiotic issue.Some general guidelines would be:Clean the area &amp; your tools thoroughly.Remove mulch from the affected area &amp; all plant debris.Pick up leaves as they fall off.Disinfect pruners, etc.Alternatively, you could let the bed rest &amp; not plant nightshades in that area. After 2 or 3 years it's probably okay to plant there again. We would recommend choosing a resistant variety if you do choose to plant (yes, the fact that you may not know what your resisting could be a problem). This link has information about common tomato problems to Colorado. Pages 3 &amp; 4 have good information about fungi &amp; viruses. https://extension.colostate.edu/docs/pubs/garden/02949.pdfYoucouldalsochoosetoplant in 7 gal (or larger)containerswith freshsoil.Fertilizeonaregularbasis ifgrowing in apot.Goodluckwithyourgarden!

  - Its likely the damage was caused by an herbicide (weed killer) which was sprayed outdoors. That can occur even if the seedlings are indoors or in a greenhouse. Tomatoes are very sensitive to herbicides. Even just a whiff causes problems.   If the seedlings were mine, Id scrap these, then start a new batch. However, be certain to provide very bright light as soon as the seeds sprout. These particular seedlings are excessively tall (leggy) because of low light.    Further, begin to fertilize as soon as the first true leaves develop on the seedlings. Use a product that should be dissolved in water, but mix it at half strength.

  - Most Gardeners just pinch off unwanted leaves ( including the seed leaves) before planting. Some gardeners just leave them. Taking off the leaves may pose an entry point for a pathogen but not likely since this is common practice. If you wait say a few hours or a day the wound should seal over and reduce the risk.

  - Thank you for your question.  You did not indicate your whereabouts, so I have no idea what diseases are present in your region.  I cant tell whether the spots are on the top or bottom of the leaves, nor whether they are on old or new leaves.  All that information is needed to diagnose plant problems.  Perhaps you can decide which apply, and use that to figure out which is applicable to your plant through this diagnostic tool:  http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/DiagnosticKeys/TomLeaf/TomLeafKey.html  Good luck!

  - By bottom feeding and irrigation from the top, your plants may be a bit waterlogged. Try watering the pots in the sink. Slowly add your water so as to not leach out the soil. Next, if you are ready to report into a bigger container, do it. You can plant tomatoes deep. Finally, your purpling is most likely cold damage, dont over fertilize, but get on a get on a regular schedule. Give your plants clear water once per week.

  - Tomatoes produce adventitious roots all along a submerged stem, not just at the leaf nodes. Planting deeper will encourage these roots to form and the plants will establish a strong root system. You can set transplants in the ground so that only two or three sets of true leaves are aboveground. Horizontal planting, bending the stems with just the top two or three sets of leaves exposed, is an effective way to make plants stronger, especially leggy ones. Roots will form along the buried portion of the stem. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/tomatoesChrista

  - There are several disease of tomato plants that are soil borne which is why we recommend that they be rotated to a different area every year.  Also, tomatoes do not need acidic soil and peat moss is acidic.  You may have to remove the soil and replace it with fresh.  This time try half good compost and half good garden soil that is bagged, not dug from your soil.  When purchasing plants, do some homework first.  There are some varieties that are more resistant to cracking than others.  Also, some are more resistant to various diseases.  A good resource would be to go to the Totally Tomato web site and read about all the various tomatoes and their qualities.  You can then go to a garden center armed with that information.  You can also go to our web site and click about the various symptoms you have for more information on each: http://apps.extension.umn.edu/garden/diagnose/plant/vegetable/tomato/   Also, here is a link to our publication on growing tomatoes.

  - Sun gold tomatoes are indeterminate tomatoes that must have a very tall strong cage since they can grow over 6 foot tall. Tall tomatoes can fall over during wind storms.  Determinate cherry tomatoes variety will not grow as tall. Cherry tomatoes in container get less blossom end rot that full size tomatoes. Plants that are very bushy with little fruit may be getting to much nitrogen. Try reducing the amount of fertilizer this season. Potting soil often has fertilizer in it so you do not need add compost.  Did you have any disease last year.  Most tomato leaf spot diseases overwinter in the soil and then splash on to the  lower leaves of the plant. Replace the soil if you had a fungal disease.  What do you mean by so sad?

  - Hi- yes, soil temperatures are fine for planting tomatoes. The deeper you plant them the cooler the soil will be, inhibiting root growth somewhat until the soil warms further.However, there is research indicating that planting deeply will produce better long-season growth and yields.Nighttime temps are expected to be &gt;50 degrees F. through next week so it does not look like we will be facing frost risk. But do keep an eye on the local forecasts and be prepared to cover plants overnight if temps dip to the low 30s.Jon

Air temperatures are expected to be &gt;50 degrees F. for the next week so no expected frosts that could injure seedlings and transplants.The crops you reference grow best when night temperatures are 60-65 degrees F. and day temperatures are 80-90 degrees F.Best soil temps for germination are in the 60-70 degrees F. range for these crops. Okra will germinate and grow best at slightly higher temperatures than the other crops.

  - Hi- the symptoms are largely a result of early spring weather- high winds, cool night temps, rapidly fluctuating air temperatures, etc. In addition, soil temps are relatively low and root systems are slow to grow and pick up nutrients.Very minimal flea beetle feeding can be seen in the photo on the right- small, "shot holes" in leaves. We do not see any disease symptoms. There is no need to move or replace your plants. You may want to lightly fertilize with a complete, soluble fertilizer later this week when the rain stops. Next year, it would be best to plant warm season crops in mid-May, depending on the weather.Here is some additional information on vegetable seedling and transplant problems: http://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/vegetable-seedlings-transplants-problemsJon

  - Hi- unsettled spring weather is hard on the tender transplants of warm-season vegetable crops. Leaves that are yellowed, bleached, bruised, torn, punctured, spotted, and discolored are showing symptoms associated with challenging spring growing conditions. These include, high winds, cool night temps, cloudy and rainy weather, and rapidly fluctuating air temperatures, etc. In addition, soil temps are relatively low, so root systems are slow to grow, pick up nutrients, and become established. Under such harsh conditions plants just sit and get beat up by the elements.Peppers grow more slowly than tomatoes so expect them to struggle for awhile as they get established. The recent cool nights will not have much affect on later flowering and fruit set, but do pinch off pepper blossoms for 3-4 weeks to get strong root systems.Night temperatures below 50-55 degrees F. typically cause pollination and fruit development problems (even though only buds are exposed) resulting in "catfacing" of tomato fruits (crevices, hollows and holes).There is no way to prevent this other than holding off on transplanting until late May. Cultivars vary in degree to which low night temps will negatively affect fruit. It's typically best to immediately remove these fruits as they don't develop/ripen well and only portions may be edible.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/catfacing-vegetablesJon

  - With the cool, wet weather and cooler night time temperatures that are expected this week, it's not an ideal time to plant tomatoes unless you use"walls of water" or cloches to provide additional heat. If you plant now, they aren't likely to do much growing during the cooler, wetter weather. You'll get quicker growth if you wait for temps. to warm up.

  - I think your troubles began with the seedlings because the seed starting medium was not sterile. You really shouldn't use old soil to start seeds because the soil can contain pathogens. Buy a sterile seed starting mix. The old seeds may have been marginally viable as well. When using old seed you should take several seeds and spread them between two wet paper towels and put them in a warm spot. If they are viable they will start a root. Note the percentage of seeds that germinated and if it is low the seeds probably are not worth using.From your question it sounds like you have been seed starting for quite a few years. Are you seed saving? Some of the seeds you saved may have been infected with a pathogen, particularly if they are old.I assume you hardened the seedlings off before you planted them in the garden.Here is a link the starting seeds just for your review. Making sure things are sterile is the key to success.https://extension.umn.edu/planting-and-growing-guides/starting-seeds-indoors

  - Hi- yes, those are fungal leaf spots- most likely Septoria leaf spot. The infection might have occurred during transplant production or after you put them in the ground. Septoria and early blight are ubiquitous fungal diseases of tomato in Maryland.Avoid any overhead watering. Prune off and discard lower leaf branches with infected leaves. This will reduce upward movement. Keep plants well supported and prune out excessive lush sucker growth to improve air circulation and promote rapid leaf drying. Keep plants watered during hot, dry spells and fertilize when first fruits start to form. If the disease progresses rapidly you can spray with a copper fungicide.More detailed information:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/septoria-leaf-spot-vegetableshttps://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/early-blight-vegetables

  - Cucumber Mosaic Virus (CMV) is not persistent in the soil but other plants and aphids can be vectors. Heirloom varieties can be more susceptible to certain diseases. Also, plants that are healthy are less susceptible to diseases. Controlling nearby weeds and pests is important in controlling diseases. Sanitation of hands and tools can also reduce risk of infections. You are probably not looking at a disease issue in the first two pictures. The pictures show symptoms of nutrient issues. This could be from too much water, nutrient poor soil, or a pH issue. The seedling picture is a little more concerning and should be monitored. A soil test would be highly recommended to determine pH and nutrients levels. Also, if you have black walnuts nearby, that can be a factor in failure of plants to thrive. Check out the following links:   https://extension.psu.edu/cucumber-mosaic-virus   https://homesoiltest.msu.edu/   https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/growing_vegetable_gardens_near_black_walnut_trees   Please let us know if we can be of further assistance.

  - Hi- physiologic leaf roll usually occurs later in the season as a result of sustained hot weather, big fruit load, and heavy pruning. It is known to be somewhat variable by cultivar. Aphid feeding typically causes a downward curl. Excess soil moisture (saturated soil) will cause leaf curling in tomato. You may need to back off the watering and allow the soil to dry out. The root system should stay moist- not wet.Please send additional photos if you notice small, twisted, and distorted leaves.Jon

## 118938_Maryland
* askextension_tomato/118938_Maryland
  - Hi- the symptoms- curling, twisting, smallish leaves- is consistent with herbicide injury. Some herbicides, such as 2,4-D and clopyralid, mimic natural growth regulators in plants causing hormonal imbalances leading to plant death.Your plants will most likely not grow out of the injury to produce a decent crop (tomato is especially susceptible to this type of herbicide injury). You may want to look for new plants.An herbicide may have drifted in to your garden area. It can also travel with stormwater or irrigation run-off from lawn areas treated with herbicides, including "weed &amp; feed" products. A less likely source would be a soil amendment- grass clippings, straw, manure, compost- that may have been contaminated with one of the long-residual herbicides such as clopyralid or aminopyralid. If you suspect the later you can test the soil that the tomato plants are growing in by mixing some soil with potting soil and planting bean or pea seeds in the mix. If the soil is contaminated you will see poor germination and distortion symptoms.These two web pages have detailed information on herbicide contamination and how to perform a bio-assay to test for it:https://puyallup.wsu.edu/soils/clopyralid/https://www.pubs.ext.vt.edu/content/dam/pubs_ext_vt_edu/PPWS/PPWS-77/PPWS-77P-pdf.pdf Jon

  - This sounds suspiciously like the question you submitted last fall. So you do know that all Extension sources recommend pruning, cutting off branches of any other trees that touch your apple tree and removal of any berry bearing plants, like raspberries, where the fungi overwinters and multiplies. If you are determined to use copper spray make sure you read the label for directions on what concentration to use and make sure it is labeled for apples and/or tomatoes. On tomatoes, all leaves that touch the soil need to be removed and the ground mulched beneath the plant to prevent splashing. Also, the tomatoes should be rotated to a different area as tomato disease are transmitted from the soil.

  - Hi- these fertilizers are fine to use if needed. If your soil is high in organic matter you may only need to fertilize lightly at transplanting to help plants get established, again when first fruits are marble size, and then once more 2-3 weeks later. If soil fertility and organic matters are relatively low, once a month would be sufficient, unless you see signs of nutrient deficiency- leaves off-color and plants growing very slowly.Jon

## 119423_Maryland
* askextension_tomato/119423_Maryland
  - Hi- sorry to hear that production is down. It's unlikely that the soil has too much organic matter. Tomatoes grow well in soils that are 50% compost by volume. Excess nitrogen can promote vegetative growth at the expense of flowers and fruits. But the kitchen scrap compost you are adding is relatively low in nitrogen (maybe 1% by weight) and that nitrogen is released slowly. Test your soil this year to get some baseline information on nutrient levels and soil pH and follow lab recommendations:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/soil-testingOther possibilities- low sunlight (too much shade), crowding, and botrytis (blossom and fruit stem disease) can all reduce fruiting and yields. Environmental stressors can also reduce fruiting, especially high day (over 90 degrees F.) and night (over 70 degrees F.) temperatures. Jon

  - Hi- there is a about a two week period between tomato buds opening and flower petals dropping followed by a 40-50 period between flower petals dropping and ripe fruit. If plants are crowded, shaded, and/or over-fertilized with nitrogen you may see lots of blooms and fewer fruits. Side note- pick fruits when they are full size and starting to turn. Ripen fruits on kitchen counter. You will enjoy many more fruit this way. Fruits left to fully ripen on the vine will crack, split, rot, and suffer insect and wildlife injury.A drop-off in production last August could have been due to many different factors- disease(s) weakening plants over time, using determinate (self-topping) rather than indeterminate cultivars, too much or too little water, etc.Jon

  - Those symptoms are not biotic, meaning it is not a pathogen. That is rapid tissue death caused by something abiotic, meaning something not alive. They do look a little yellow, which means nitrogen is lacking. The leaf edge burn can also indicate a potassium deficiency.I see this a lot in the spring in fresh transplants that are still getting used to the "real world". They can get starved in the transplant tray and will take a little while to recover in the soil. Also, I see those spots all the time on farms that overhead irrigate with fertilizer in it. The fertilizer burns the leaves because it is a salt. Sunlight itself also burns the leaves if water droplets do not drop off of the leaf, and sometimes this is worse when plants are not properly hardened off.My advice is to feed the soil, and not the plant. Foliar applied nutrients are almost never needed if you meet your soil test needs with granular fertilizers mixed into the soil ahead of planting, and mid-season along the sides of the plants. Further, with this long cool wet spring we are having, nutrient deficiencies are showing up everywhere. Cool soils make it hard for plants to use the fertilizer, and the frequent rains have washed fertilizer below the rootzone for a lot of people.

According to this OSU Extension article (https://extension.oregonstate.edu/news/tomato-lovers-grow-best-recognizing-solving-common-problems), "Blossom drop: It's usually caused by dry soil and dry winds, but also may be caused by a sudden cold spell, heavy rain or too much nitrogen. Usually not all blossoms will fall off, and another set of flowers will appear."We've certainly had a variety of temperatures and rain conditions the last month.  Typically, the nightshade plants (tomatoes, peppers and eggplants) shouldn't be planted before the soil is 70 degrees.  Your plants may not need to be watered once a day.  It's best to test to see whether the soil is dry an inch down, before doing so.  You can wash away fertilizer, whether chemical or organic.Here is another Extension article which may help with your crop: https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/ec1333Good luck!

  - Hello,  That is a Clavate tortoise beetle, Plagiometriona clavata (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae).  These tortoise beetles are small (5/16 of an inch), oval, "turtle-shaped" beetle. Tortoise beetles have the sides of the body flared giving the beetle the overall shape of a World War I U.S. infantry helmet. The larvae or grubs are even more bizarre in appearance and habits. They are elongate-oval, somewhat flattened, and are quite spiny. When mature, they are about 3/8 long. The spines are thorny and somewhat branched. . The larvae are unique in that they accumulate their excrement, cast skins, and other "trash" on their backs. Once loaded with trash, the "tail" is curled up over the back, which helps to protect the grub from predators.    Tortoise beetles are leaf feeders in both the adult and larval stages. Several species are occasional pests of soybeans in other parts of the U.S. In the Northeast, tortoise beetles are occasional minor pests on potatoes and morning glories grown as ornamental flowers. Many species of tortoise beetles are beneficial insects in that they feed on bindweed, thistle, burdock, and other weeds. Tortoise beetles overwinter in the adult stage, hiding themselves in dry sheltered places under bark or trash. The adults emerge in mid- to late May. Eggs are laid either singly or in clusters of 20 to 30 directly on the host plant. The larvae begin feeding as soon as they hatch. There appears to be one generation per year in Michigan.   Tortoise beetles rarely need to be controlled, but if they do appear in damaging numbers, then an insecticide labeled for the particular will prevent further damage. Sevin Garden Dust, Ortho Bug-B-Gon (bifenthrin) and Bayer Advanced Vegetable and Garden Spray (cyfluthrin) should be very effective in controlling this beetle. Be sure to read the label before using.

  - It looks like your tomatoes are developing symptoms of a leaf spot disease. Septoria leaf spot and early blight are two common fungal diseases in tomatoes and management for both of them is similar. Remove the older, lower leaves by pruning out the branches, up to about 12" from the ground. Avoid overhead watering and use mulch at the base of the plants to minimize soil splashing. Refer to the following pages on our website for more information on these diseases and how to manage them.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/septoria-leaf-spot-vegetableshttps://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/early-blight-vegetablesChrista

  - It is not too late to do soil testing and that is a good idea.Here is our soil testing page which contains all the information you need, including a video on how to take a good sample and a list of regional labs that your can mail your sample to for analysis:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/soil-testingTo grow good ripe tomatoes and peppers, in Maryland (they want warm soil) we generally recommend either starting seed indoors 6-8 weeks before planting stocky transplants outdoors once the soil has warmed, or by purchasing transplants. (See our planting dates calendar and specific crop info pages here: https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/crops)Your seedlings are stressed and may limp along for a while and it will be difficult to get a full crop. They should be spaced with 2 feet between plants and they may not bear until late August into September.If you have the room you may want to allow some of these to grow, but suggest you also buy some transplants as well. Tomatoes are heavy feeders and they will want/need fertilization.

  - Hi- there is no specific correct date for pruning tomato vines. Many gardeners begin pinching out suckers as soon as they form. It's good to remove any suckers that emerge at the base of the plant. The number of other suckers removed depends on the cultivar and how they are grown and supported.

  - Hi- vines begin to grow rapidly with increasing soil and air temperatures in June. Shoots and main stems could grow 1-3 ft. during the month depending on cultivar, care, weather conditions, etc.All of the tomatoes you reference are self-pollinating. Pollen is released with the slightest vibration (a breeze). Vibrating or manipulating the flowers by hand will not increase fruiting.Try to leave the spider webs alone as spiders are excellent predators of pest insects.Jon

  - You are correct. These are aphids. You can dislodge them with a strong spray of water. Generally, natural predator insects such as ladybugs will catch up to aphids and help control their populations naturally.

  - Epsom Salt can will provide Magnesium to the soil. But I am not sure that is the problem. You mentioned that only 3 of the plants were not blooming. If these three are the closest to the pine tree or furthest from the pine trees it could also be a pH issue with the soil. A soil test would need to be completed to check this.Other issues could be: Different varieties, sunlight, planting depth, fertility of the soil.Seeing the site location is very beneficial in determining plant issues.

  - Hi- this is Septoria leaf spot disease, one of the two most common foliar fungal diseases of tomato. The other is early blight and management is the same. Remove the lowest leaf stems to increase air circulation and remove infected leaves, and remove excess suckers.. Keep plants well mulched to minimize soil splashing and water at the base of the plants.You could spray spray with an organic fungicide (fixed copper) Fungicide treatments can help to protect new or un-infected foliage, they are not curatives.  Remove infected plant material at the end of the season. Next year, select resistant cultivars when appropriate and increase spacing to ensure faster leaf drying.

## 121166_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/121166_Oregon
  - Generally when the lower leaves of a tomato plant start yellowing and eventually dry out, it is a fungal disease called early blight. The blight is spread by splashing water from thesoil to the leaves. The blight overwinters in the soil. Using resistant varieties, watering with a soaker hose or drip irrigation andnot a sprinkler,and rotating tomatoes location in your garden helps to prevent this. There is also a late season fungal leaf blight called Late Blight. Read about both online and look at pictures to zero in on either. Your picture looks like it could be a nutrient deficiency. Sometimes magnesium deficiency can cause a yellowing of the old leaves on the plants. If it is happening on the old leaves only and the leaves don't dry up and get brown, that could be magnesium deficiency. Some people like to sprinkle a teaspoon of Epsom salts around the base of their tomato plants to help with the deficiency since Epsom salts are magnesium sulfate.

  - Tomato leaf curl may be caused by two things, either a virus or very wet conditions. If your problem is caused by a virus, then you have a white fly problem. This often occurs in weedy gardens which seem to attract the white flies. Unfortunately, there is no treatment for the virus and the recommendation is to remove and destroy the plants. Heavy mulch or plastic will help keep weeds down in future tomato beds.If the curl was caused by wet conditions, there is also no treatment, but the plants should recover enough to bear fruit, especially since you said the lower leaves are still healthy. We have had a record wet year, so I hope this is the cause of your problem.

  - Hi- thanks for the photos and questions.1. Leaf curl of lower tomato leaves during hot dry weather is not uncommon and is variable based on cultivar. Your photo shows severe leaf roll throughout the entire plant which is a bit unusual. Your plants appear healthy. The leaf curl could be caused by excess heat, lack of soil moisture, severe crowding or some other unseen environmental factors. You may want to increase the amount of water given to that plant and prune away some of the excess suckers to improve air circulation and reduce above ground crowding (especially suckers coming out of the plant base).https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/leaf-curl-vegetables2. We agree that this appears to be some very minor leaf feeding by an insect (beetle, caterpillar, or leafminer perhaps). No worries there.3. The nubs are adventitious roots. If the stem was buried you'd have roots growing freely. It's normal an is even more common on heirloom cultivars. No worries here either.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/adventitious-roots-vegetablesJon

  - Many pathogens are soilborne,some windborne, some can be seedborne, and some that are vectored by insects from infected weeds.  This appears to be septoria leaf spot.  The most effective way to handle fungal diseases is usually by preventing them, usually with a fungicide.  Once infected it is important to stop the spread.  Without denuding the plant take off infected leafs.  A copper fungicide will offer some protection and slow the progress.  Copper will also help with the bacterial pathogens.  Sanitation is also important.  Don't handle plants when wet. Avoid overhead watering.  Sanitize pruning tools (alcohol can help).  Keep weeds at bay. Remove plant debris at the end of the season and if you can, plant in a different area next season. Pathogens are usually specific to a  family or genus so it is unlikely that the cottonwood has infected your tomatoes.  The wet weather has provided a prime environment for a pathogen to manifest itself.

  - Mealy tomatoes are often caused by stress to the plant. This can come in many forms but includes insufficient nutrients, too much water or conditions too hot. Likely potted plants are in a container with good drainage so probably not water, and this is happening early in the season so heat likely not the cause (unless located where there is reflected heat). Tomatoes need a balance between nitrogen and potassium and if nitrogen is too high and potassium too low this can cause mealy tomatoes. You may want to use a fertilizer specifically for tomatoes.

## 121787_Oregon
* askextension_tomato/121787_Oregon
  - Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert. There could be several reasons for the leaves to shrivel. There could be small sucking insects on the underneath side. Look for aphids (dark gray, light green, or yellowish) or white flies (tiny specks of white) or some other sucking insect. If it is insects you can use Insecticidal soap to kill them. Spray the top and bottoms of the leaves and spray some on the ground around the tomato plant. You can make this withpure castile soap, 2 tablespoons to a quart of water, put in a spray bottle and spray. You can add a tablespoon of regular vegetable oil to make it hold onto the leaves better. Do not use other liquid soaps as they might damage the tomato leaves. If the leaves are a dark green all over then I might suspect insects. If the leaves are browned on the edges, it could be sun burn. If the leaves are shriveled and looked dried out it could be lack of water.  If you do not feel any of these are the reasons for the shriveled leaves, why not send a few pictures.  Give us a little more information. Was the plant doing well to begin with? Is it just one tomato plant? Do you have others that are not bothered by this problem? What type of container or bed is it in? Have you fertilized the plant and if so, what did you use? Did you follow the instructions on the package? Did anyone spray herbicides in the area? Could an animal be urinating in the soil around the plant - that will kill the plant.  I hope these suggestions help you decide what is wrong with the tomato plant.

  - On plant number 1, probably Early Blight, Alternaria fungus. Overwinters in infected plant debris and soil .The pathogen also survives on tomato seed or may be introduced on tomato transplants. Lower leaves become infected when in contact with contaminated soil, either through direct contact or through rain-splashed soil. Spores can germinate between 47 and 90 F and need free water or humidity of 90% or greater. Spores infect plants and form leaf spots as small as 1/8 inch diameter and in as little as five days.Photo 2 shows it at the tip but the patch yellowing is not consistent with this disease. This seems more more consistent with a non-living cause.

If these tomatoes are in the ground in your garden you will need to move them next year. If they are in pots replace the soil.I would remove all the infected leaves and then use a fungicide (if you are not opposed) to protect the rest of the plant. Use a fungicide like chlorothalonil, maneb, macozeb, or a copper -based fungicide, such as Bordeaux mixture, copper hydroxide, copper sulfate, or copper oxychloride sulfate. Follow harvest restrictions listed on the pesticide label.When you water be sure to water at the base of the plant. Do not spray the plant with water because the splashing will spread the spores.

  - Use the fertilizer at a rate of  cup of 46-0-0, or 1 cup of 27-3-3, or 3- cups 10-3-1 for each 100 feet of row. Spread the fertilizer in a six-inch wide band, and scratch it into the surface of the soil.The following sites will allow you to test your soil.  The soil test will tell you the soil texture, pH, and nutrients that are needed.  Many soils in MN do not need extra nutrients. Unless your soil test report specifically recommends additional phosphorus, use a low- or no-phosphorus fertilizer.Too much nitrogen fertilization will lead to plants that are bushy, leafy, and slow to bear fruit.

Leaf curling is tomato plants way of dealing with stress.The purple veining could be explained by a phosphorous deficiency, and the curling can be due to pruning, water stress, etc. The fact that they stopped growing and the new foliage is small and distorted does seem to be viral. The deformed fruit is unusual. Putting it all together BCTV is a good fit.  It could be the vectoring beet leafhopper just didn't get the fourth one. Weed control of adjacent areas can help to keep the beet leaf hopper population down. Another scenario would be herbicide damage through drift or volatilization.

Here is our article on blossom end rot: https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/blossom-end-rot-vegetablesBlossom end rot is caused by not enough calcium getting to the fruit when the plant is growing rapidly. This can be caused by soil pH outside the optimal range, low soil calcium, not enough or inconsistent watering, or too much nitrogen fertilizer causing too fast growth.

## 122677_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/122677_Colorado
  - We have been receiving many questions about this type of thing on tomatoes.     It is a little difficult to tell from photos without plant samples.  Tomatoes are susceptible to many problems. This could possibly be early blight, which is caused by a fungus and is common on tomatoes during the hotter months. It causes brown to black, target-like spots on older leaves. If severe, the fungus also attacks stems and fruit. Affected leaves may turn yellow, then drop.  Septoria leaf spotis another fungal disease that is less common in Colorado than early blight. It causes white or gray spots on leaves, surrounded by a black or brown margin. Control is similar to early blight.   Your plants might survive to produce tomatoes for you anyway. Early treatment would include trimming diseased leaves from the plants and fertilizing lightly with nitrogen once a month. Sulfur dust may help protect new leaves from infection.    Sanitation is the best control for the future. When you are done with the plant, dispose of the plant and any leaves on the ground, as the fungus overwinters on leaf debris.    Here are some links to more information about tomato problems, including early blight:   https://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/recognizing-tomato-problems-2-949/   https://ag.purdue.edu/btny/ppdl/Pages/Tomato-Blight.aspx   https://extension.umaine.edu/ipm/ipddl/publications/5087e/      If you would like more information, you are welcome to bring a sample of the plant to us here at Gardening Help.

  - Hi- the symptoms are consistent with spider mite injury. They are very small and difficult to see with the unaided eye. Try looking at leaf undersides with a magnifier or hand lens. Look closely to see signs of this pest- live adult mites, mite eggs, cast skins, fecal specks.There are two species that commonly feed on tomato, eggplant, and other garden plants when weather gets hot. Their piercing-sucking mouthparts cause those tiny white/ten spots (stipples) on leaf surfaces.More information on this pest and how to manage it:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/spider-mite-vegetablesSpraying insecticidal soap, horticultural oil, or other miticides when foliar injury is severe could lead to leaf burn and further stress your plants. This is especially true during hot weather. Spraying foliage with water discourages mite activity. Do this in the morning and afternoon to give plants a chance to dry before nightfall (so as not to encourage disease problems).Jon

  - Either early blight or septoria leaf spot. The difference in appearance is that Blight affects both the stem and the tomatoes. See the picture in the website below. Septoria leaf spot is mainly a leaf disease. It happens when dirt splashes up on leaves. Many people remove the bottom branches of tomato plants for this reason. Then it doesnt spread. This makes the plant stronger! So look at the stem and pictures at the websites. Remove the affected branches and bury them or burn them in the fall to prevent soil retention. If its leaf spot another solution is to rotate tomatoes to another site next year.

  - Hi- garlic will not be effective. Neem oil is most effective if the spay directly contacts young stink bugs, soon after hatching from eggs (nymphs). Neem oil and other organic insecticides will be only nominally effective against the adults. Brown and Southern green stinkbugs are the two native species we most often see, although brown marmorated stink bug is still active in MD. Stink bugs are difficult pests when the populations are high. Commercial growers using chemical insecticides have a hard time managing stink bugs!Handpick and destroy egg masses if you can locate them in the upper canopy on leaf undersides.Stink bugs also feed on various weeds so keep weeds under control.Pick fruit that are just barely turning and allow them to ripen indoors.

  - This condition is called blossom end rot and is fairly common in tomatoes.  It occurs when the plants experience lack of water (droopy leaves) followed by lots of water. Since you are in containers, make sure that there is adequate drainage, i.e. drain holes in the bottom of the container and make sure the soil never dries out. In these hot days, it may require watering twice a day. . Calcium deficiency is also a cause of blossom end rot. Although counterintuitive, calcium deficiency can be caused by over fertilizing. Check with the garden center for a calcium additive for tomato plants. As an alternative, add powdered milk to the watering solution once per week. Maybe a tablespoon or so for each plant..  You need to remove the damaged fruit and discard; it can not be saved.  Since you are in containers make sure that there is adequate drainage, i.e. drain holes in the bottom of the container

  - Look closely at the leaves and see if there are any brown spots that appear before the leaf begins yellowing.  If spots are evident, it would indicate a fungal disease.  Remove all infected leaves and spray with a fungicide indicated for use on vegetables.  Do not water overhead and repeat fungicide applications per instructions on the container.If there are no spots evident then the pattern of lower leaves wilting and yellowing could indicate Fusarium Wilt which is considered to be a warm-weather disease.  This disease is soil-borne and can survive in the soil for many years.  See the web site below for more information and pictures of typical tomato diseases. Hope thathelps.http://extension.msstate.edu/publications/common-diseases-tomatoes

  - Hello,Yes, using a light shade cloth (30%) would benefit the plants. But completely covering them with another type of material may not be of benefit and could be detrimental. In the heat you're probably noticing the leaves are starting to curl/roll. This is the plant's way of helping prevent water loss. More importantly, when it's this hot, the flower will abort, so fruit production may be limited. Keep up with regular water!

  - Hello, Did you grow any related crops in this soil in the last 3-5 years- potato, pepper? Examine the stems back to the roots looking for any damage by animals, insects, or abrasion by stakes or ties. As these plants get heavier with fruit, are your ties cutting into the stem? Switch to strips of old tee shirts or something similar to see if that makes a difference. Unless you filled your raised beds with soil from your garden within 150 feet of the walnut, or you composted walnut leaves and then added it to your raised beds, the walnut shouldnt be affecting the soil. When you pulled the wilted plant had its roots grown into the soil beneath the raised bed? That could indicate the walnuts juglone affected the plant. Here are references for the most common wilt issues on tomatoes. Initially this sounds like fusarium wilt, even though you arent seeing any yellowing of the leaves. Check that the variety of tomato you grow is resistant to wilts. Heirloom varieties are typically not resistant. Slice open the wilted stems and look for discolored tissues as described in the following links- https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetables Verticillium wilt on tomatoes- http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Verticillium.htm Root knot nematodes- when you pull a plant, rinse the soil off roots and compare with pictures here-https://content.ces.ncsu.edu/control-of-root-knot-nematodes-in-the-home-vegetable-garden A Key listing tomato issues- http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/DiagnosticKeys/TomWlt/TomWiltKey.html#Bacterial Some common varieties resistant to wilts- https://extension.illinois.edu/veggies/tomato.cfm If still a mystery, submit pictures and a whole plant to MSU Plant diagnostic lab.

  - Hi, as far as the feeding damage I cannot tell you what is doing this with out seeing it. I think I might see some dark droppings on a couple of leaves which may be the droppings of a caterpillar. I cannot be sure though.You say the tomatoes have been affected by some sort of blight for the past two summers. Tomatoes do not like it super hot. Greenhouses can get very hot with out adequate ventilation. When this happens they twist and curl and the leaves look very poorly. How is your greenhouse ventilation and air flow? Tomatoes also need good nutrition several times during the growing season but they don't need a lot of nitrogen, the first number on a fertilizer container. Have you fertilized the tomatoes lately? A good tomato fertilizer might have numbers like 5-8-8, something like that.What about watering? Tomatoes are really sensitive to drying out. They want a fairly constant moisture level in the soil. With our quick draining soils that means you really need to make sure they don't get dry more than an inch or so before watering again. I don't see any sign of a blight on the tomatoes so check out what ideas I brought up to see if that might be going on in your green house.Thanks for your question.

  - Hi- this is called "catfacing" and is thought to result from cool spring temperatures (under 50-55 degrees F.) interfering with flower parts leading to distorted fruit growth. This can happen even before buds appear. In this case, you should remove the fruits as they will not have much value upon ripening. Pull these fuits as soon as you see them appear. There is no cure. Later fruits should be ok. Try planting later next year.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/catfacing-vegetablesJon

  - Hi- this appears to be blossom end rot.  This is a common nutritional disorder of tomatoes caused by a shortage of calcium in developing fruits. Fruits may experience a calcium shortage if there is a calcium deficiency in the soil or, more typically, if plants are subject to extreme water fluctuations.  Factors that encourage blossom-end rot include: low soil pH, low levels of calcium, inconsistent watering, shallow watering, droughty conditions, and excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers.  When symptoms appear, remove fruits immediately.  Plants usually grow out of this condition as the season passes.  To prevent the problem maintain soil pH in the 6.3-6.8 range, mix in a handful of gypsum (calcium sulfate) or ground limestone into the planting hole prior to transplanting, keep plants well mulched and watered through the growing season, and avoid overfertilization with high nitrogen fertilizers. The problem should self-correct if plants are being watered regularly and evenly. If plants are receiving regular, deep watering during dry weather periods and you continue to observe the issue on newly formed fruits you can spray the plants with commercially available products (ex: "Stop Rot"), that contain calcium chloride.See our website for photos and more information: http://extension.umd.edu/growit/blossom-end-rot-vegetablesJon

  - Hi- picking fruit when it just starts to turn color is a good practice, although as you've seen, stinkbugs will sting and feed on green fruit as well. Stinkbugs are some of the most difficult insects to manage because of their habit of staying the interior of the canopy and dropping down when disturbed. Look for and smash egg masses when you find them. Direct sprays of insecticidal soap or pyrethrins on nymphs can be effective.

  - The tomato plant looks ok. It is not uncommon for some leaves to turn yellow as nitrogen is moved from older leaves to new growth. Feel free to remove the yellow leaves.

## 123751_Minnesota

  - One of the most common reasons for lack of tomato blooms is too much nitrogen. Tomatoes have a preferred temperature range of 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit  during the day and 55 to 70 degrees at night.  The blossoms drop if the temperature is outside of this range. Tomatoes will not bloom if they are planted in too much shade.

## 123757_Minnesota

  - Do not fertilize with a high nitrogen fertilizer. That is the first number, i.e. 30-10-20. Nitrogen will promote more leaves at the expense of fruit. Make sure the plants have full sun if they are in pots and able to be moved. Otherwise, depending on the variety of plant you have, some are later blooming than others. You could put some fertilizer in the soil that is expressly formulated for tomatoes. That is available in full service garden centers. Otherwise, just patience. Sorry.

## 123922_Minnesota

  - Tomatoes are self pollinated. Lightly shaking the plant may help with pollination. "Tomato plants will drop their flowers when daytime temperatures are  above 85F or when nighttime temperatures are above 70F. Obviously this  can and does occur during mid-summer. In the early part of the season  low nighttime temperatures below 55F can interfere with the growth of  pollen tubes or cause the pollen to become sterile, preventing normal  fertilization and causing flower drop. Fruit will not set until  nighttime temperatures are above 55F for at least two consecutive  nights. The relative humidity (RH) also can play a role in poor  pollination and fruit set. The best RH for tomato development is between  40% and 70%. Low RH (&lt;40%) can dry pollen out making it unable to  stick to the stigma. A high RH (&gt;70%) can prevent the pollen from  being shed properly. While there are other factors that have been found  to influence pollination in tomato such as levels of nitrogen that are  either too high or too low, too high or low soil moisture, a heavy fruit  set, excessive wind that can desiccate flowers, and the lack of  sufficient light these are minor factors compared with temperature." https://extension.udel.edu/weeklycropupdate/?p=11727

## 123990_Colorado
* askextension_tomato/123990_Colorado
  - Tomato varieties will produce fruit consistent with the varieties planted. Tomato flowers come complete with both male and female organs and are self-fertilizing, so they do not need a second cultivar for pollination. Vibration from the wind or pollinators will sufficiently pollinate the flower of each plant.      Cross-pollination can occur but will only affect the seed and not the fruit, taste or texture of the current year produce. If you are planning to save the seed and plant it next year, it will not grow into the plant you expect if it was cross-pollinated. Below is an explanation of pollination of tomatoes from the University of Nebraska. Hybrid tomatoes can be cross-pollinated; however, it is discouragedtosavetheseedbecause of possible genetic recombination.      https://extension.unl.edu/statewide/douglas-sarpy/pdfs/ce/resources/ce-g1864-selecting-tomatoes-for-...

  - Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert.There are two types of tomato plants, determinate and indeterminate.  The determinate type of tomato sets tomatoes and they all ripen at about the same time.  The indeterminate tomatoes set fruit all season and ripen throughouttheseason.  The first question is, do you have determinate or indeterminate tomatoes?If you have determinate tomatoes, look at the variety you purchased and Google it like this:  Big Boy tomato determinate? site=.eduOf course you would put in your variety not Big Boy.  The site=.edu will bring up universities that have published on the topic. If you have determinate varieties, stop watering and let them ripen.  If they are indeterminate, you can continue watering. I have added a link with a lot of information on tomatoes from Idaho Extension you may be interested in.

  - Thanks for your question. There are many types of diseases that can infect tomato leaves and/or fruit. These may be either fungal or bacterial. During moist conditions such as youve been having in the Twin Cities area, these diseases can be especially prevalent. Here is a good article describing the most common diseases:   https://hgic.clemson.edu/factsheet/tomato-diseases-disorders/   As you consider these various possibilities, you may observe that the symptoms for these various diseases do not really describe your condition. I suspect what is causing the yellow spots on your tomato leaves is due to sun scorch. This develops during periods of very hot weather. See:   https://homeguides.sfgate.com/burnt-spots-tomato-leaves-look-like-92074.html   The affected leaves can be removed, placed in a plastic bag, and put in the trash.

  - Hi there,There are several things that may affect your tomato plants like this. The first is physiological damage caused by hot, dry, windy weather. This causes a leaf curl due to the harsh conditions. In this very hot weather, you may need to water more than once a day in the full sun locations.It does not look like a typical virus but that is also a potential. It could be a bacterial canker that would cause the lower leaves to curl first. It looks to me like you have issues on the lower half in terms of the leaves browning as well as curling. We would need a sample of the plant in order to diagnose that without much visual confirmation available via the pictures. Since you have been having these difficulties for a few years in a row, I would definitely try some crop rotation as many viruses and cankers are soil borne and will continue to cause the same problems each year if the soil isn't switched out or you don't plant in different soil.There is a possibility that it is a critter like psyllids or aphids but I don't see any specific signs of that.Last but not least, it could be damage from our late spring cold snap (freezing temps, hail) if the plants were put out early and not protected.I would suggest you water a bit more, add some fertilizer with phosphorus to see if you can save the plants. Next year, either replace the soil or plant your tomatoes in a different spot. I'm sorry I can't be of more help but pictures limit how much can be diagnosed.Good luck.

  - The cracking is from changes in moisture; like getting too dry and then too wet, or a sudden heavy rainfall.  The spots on your tomato are definitely caused by a virus.  I have never seen ones that are so teardrop shaped.  Nebraska lists a ringspot virus in this handout that looks somewhat similar. The tomato virus will not hurt you, so I would see if the tomato taste ok.

However, we wouldn't know unless you had the plant tested for virus from the CSU Plant Diagnostic Clinic.Regardless, it might not be worth the time or money, since the likely result is that you'll have to dispose of the plant.

  - Temperature, plant nutrition and soil moisture conditions are the most serious environmental factors that affect tomato production. Temperature or weather conditions are one of those we have no control over.  So this spring was colder and wetter and it lasted through June.  Ideally, when the daytime air temperature is in the 60's.  When there is a week of temperatures during the day that are in the mid-fifties, this stunts plants.  Planting the tomatoes too soon can stunt their growth.  Here is a link for you: CMG Garden Notes #717

  - The quick answer is -high temperatures slow tomato growth. When temps get above 90 degrees all plant processes slow down, blooms may fall (even if pollinated), fruit growth slows and plants almost go dormant. as Temps cool plant biology increases. Most of the set fruit will mature, but may be small at first.The long answer is other less common stresses can slow plants down too. The wrong pH, lack of needed nutrients and late planting time can all contribute to slow growth. The past 18 months were excessively rainy and then 90+ degree temps set in immediately. I suspect when temps let up the plants will continue to grow and bear, as long as there are bees and other pollinators available in your garden.

  - You may be dealing with several issues. The bumps on the stems are adventitious roots. This is not a disease or insect. Tomato plants, particularly heirloom varieties, and tomatillos may produce small growths with short, fleshy, bristles. These are adventitious roots or aerial roots which would grow into normal roots if placed in contact with the soil. The degree to which a gardener will see this is determined by cultivar, weather conditions, and culture. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/adventitious-roots-vegetablesLeaf curling - The upward rolling of the lower leaves of tomato plants is a common occurrence in mid-summer and is associated with high temperatures. Some tomato cultivars are more prone to leaf roll (see above photo). It does not harm plant growth or yields. https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/leaf-curl-vegetablesYellowing and brown spots - It is normal for the lower leaves to yellow and brown. Remove them. Also, the plants can be susceptible to a foliar disease called early blight. See more information on management https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/early-blight-vegetablesBlack on bottom sounds like blossom end rot - a comon nutritional disorder. Fruits may experience a shortage of calcium if water becomes less available to plant roots (drought). Regular, deep watering will alleviate the problem if calcium levels in the soil are adequate. Remove the affected fruits. See more https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/blossom-end-rot-vegetablesMarian

  - Thanks for the question.   At this time of the year, there are several diseases that are seen in tomatoes and peppers. They are due to fungi, bacteria, or viruses. Two of the most common diseases observed in tomatoes as the fruit begins to develop are Septoria Leaf Spot (a fungal disease) and Bacterial Leaf Spot. My suspicion is Septoria Leaf Spot. The following will describe these two diseases as well as others and remedial actions:   https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/insects-and-diseases-tomatoes   https://extension.umn.edu/diseases/bacterial-spot-tomato-and-pepper   https://www.missouribotanicalgarden.org/gardens-gardening/your-garden/help-for-the-home-gardener/advice-tips-resources/pests-and-problems/diseases/fungal-spots/septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato.aspx   http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/factsheets/Tomato_Septoria.htm   https://www.thespruce.com/identifying-and-controlling-septoria-leaf-spot-of-tomato-1402974   https://www.gardeningknowhow.com/edible/vegetables/tomato/septoria-leaf-spot.htm   https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/septoria_leaf_spot_on_tomatoes_preventing_spots_before_your_eyes   https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/tomato-leaf-spot-diseases   For the time being, remove the diseased leaves, place them in a plastic bag, and discard in the trash.

  - I cannot tell exactly what the leasions on the leaves look like. It could be a couple of things depending on that they are like. You need to take several of the damaged leaves to your local extension office you someone can look at them close up. I live in western ND so not possible for me. Remove and clean up all the damaged leaves and destroy them.  Do not compost. The organisms that can cause this will overwinter in any debris left behind. It would be best not to plant tomatoes in this area next year.

  - Hello RebeccaI am so sorry to hear you had hail damage to your tomatoes. I would take the following steps: Prune back and remove all damaged foliage. Remove any fruit that is so damaged that not it will not be usable. Fertilize lightly,maybe 1/2 strength. Because these are cherry tomatoes, they are probably indeterminate. That means that they continue to grow bloom and set fruit throughout the entire growing season, so you may get a few more fruit.

  - If I understand you correctly, the question is about whether this is actually the variety stupice. It is not uncommon for varieties to get mislabeled. In fact I bought a cherry tomato this year that is nothing like the variety I was expecting. The other issue is the company producing the seeds. Sometimes not a lot of effort is given to roguing out off types. In the case of tomatoes that are mostly self-pollinated that is not a huge issue but it is always possible.

  - This looks like Early Blight to me, which is caused by the fungal pathogenAlternaria solani.Diagnosing tomato diseases can be challenging from pictures, but that is my best guess. I also saw the pictures that you sent through your local extension office. Early blight is polycyclic, which means that it will continue to produce spores and infect healthy tissue when conditions are right for spore formation. Leaf wetness from dew, rain, or overhead irrigation will stimulate sporulation and further spread of the disease. Anything that you can do to reduce leaf wetness will slow its progression. Treating with a fungicide that is labelled for use in the home garden against early blight will also slow the spread, but will not cure the infection.For next year, if they plan to grow tomatoes or potatoes, it will be very important to remove and destroy all of the infected plant residue (whole plants, fallen fruits, leaves, etc), because it will serve as inoculum for next year's crop. Inspecting the surrounding natural areas for solanaceous weeds (e.g. nightshades) and removing them will also prevent the return of this disease next year. I would also recommend choosing Early Blight resistant varieties for next year's garden.

  - You probably have early or late blight.  It is in our soils and bringing in ;compost did not cause it.  If you use grass clippings, do not put the ones after using a weed killer in your garden.  Compost them.  Other clippings, including those after fertilizing, are fine.  Put down a very thin layer so they dry quickly.  There are some plants that are more resistant than other to blights but they are not full proof.  They just seem to develop blight later in the season.  You need to rotate where your tomatoes are planted each year.  That does help somewhat. Also, good air circulation helps.  If it makes you feel any better, as a Master Gardener for 20+ years, I still get blight this time of year but the tomatoes still ripen.  Sometimes on a plant with very few leaves left.

  - Hi- sorry to hear about your tomato woes. We see crabgrass and stiltgrass in the photos and can barely make out some type of container. Hot weather (especially when evening temperatures are in the 70-80 degree range) can cause pollination/fertilization problems leading to blossom drop and failure to fruit. It looks like your plants were next to a hard surface walkway which could further increase the temperature around the plants.Each container tomato plant requires about 5-gallons of growing media. It seems that weed growth and other factors also contributed to poor growth.Please view our web page son these topics:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/tomatoeshttps://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/container-gardeningJon

Sometimes earwigs can cause damage to ripening fruit.Whether or not they are safe to eat depends on your comfort.

  - Hello Mrs PaulsenEarly girl is a smaller cultivar of tomato. The size should be about 6 ounces. So the description of about the size of a tennis ball sounds right. You could try growing another cultivar that is a bit bigger. Fruit size is related to days to maturity, so bigger tomatoes tend to take longer to ripen, and our growing season may not be long enough to make really large tomatoes worthwhile.I suggest you try planting a different variety next year. Local garden centers carry a wide range of plants. With over 2000 tomato varieties there are many choices.When you are selecting a variety consider days to maturity, I like to keep it to less than 100. Even if you don't want to start the plants from seed, seed catalogues can give you lots of good ideas about what to look for in a variety.Good luck with you tomato growing, there is nothing like a home grown, vine ripened tomato!

  - Thanks for the question.   Its too bad about your tomatoes. I love growing tomatoes and know that after weeks of TLC just how frustrating it is to get tomatoes that have been attacked by some critter. Heres what I think is going on. The damage to your tomatoes is probably being done by snails and/or slugs but most likely just slugs. See:   https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/slugs   This is not uncommon, especially if the actual tomatoes are close to the soil level. Im not sure what the small bugs are in your one picture but seriously doubt that they caused the damage to the fruit. Slug damage can occur rather quickly, sometimes just overnight. It would be interesting to know how quickly your tomato damage occurred? My own personal preference is to discard tomatoes that have been attacked by snails and slugs. However, I have some fellow gardeners who just cut out the damaged areas and eat the rest. It is a matter of personal preference.   As for dealing with slugs, the above reference has some remedial procedures. Additional suggestions are:   https://www.treehugger.com/lawn-garden/12-ways-get-rid-slugs-naturally.html   https://www.bhg.com/gardening/pests/insects-diseases-weeds/slugs/   Good Luck!!

  - It is fairly common with tomatoes to have them "floating" leaving a clear liguid at the bottom of the jar. If the liquid is an inch or less then you are good, if the liquid is greater than an inch then there are methods to help reduce this. Floating tomatoes can happen for several reasons:1)Over processing, be sure to followed tested, approved recipes and the stated processing times.2) Improper jar packing, hot packs will result in a higher quality product when it is an option and better packing than cold packs. Tomatoes will float when jars are not packed properly and judging packing can be difficult with tomatoes.I would not be worried if the liquid space at the bottom is an inch or less. If the space is consistently about an inch for multiple batches then the jars may be packed a little tighter. Always be sure to use approved tested recipes such as those from USDA, National Center for Home Food Preservation, Ball Blue Book, and you local Extension office.

  - Blossom End Rot.Cause A localized calcium deficiency due to any soil or growing condition that affects calcium uptake. This physiological problem is common, especially in home gardens. Blossom-end rot often occurs when soil moisture fluctuates. If too little calcium is in the soil or if the soil is high in salts, calcium uptake will be impeded, especially under periods of sudden drought stress. Excessive nitrogen applications, especially in the ammonium form, can increase a plant's demand for calcium. Once calcium is used in the plant, it becomes immobilized and cannot be translocated from older tissues to younger, growing tissues, which need calcium.https://pnwhandbooks.org/plantdisease/host-disease/tomato-lycopersicon-esculentum-blossom-end-rot

  - Hello Olga. I looked at the photos and see undeveloped and dead blossoms around the fruit in two photos. My reading of publications from universities around the US on tomato issues. The only one that talks about fruit rotting that is not blossom end rot suggests that the fruit has become damaged by the sun will rot before it ripens. Sun scald can damage developing fruit. I have seen it on my own plants. I really think that you should bring some of these affected fruits to the Master Gardener information desk in the Oregon State University Extension Office in Corvallis so they may be examined directly. The first photo of yours does look like it has some sun scald, it is hard to tell in the other photos. If this tomato is in the same box as tomato plants that are not damaged what is going on with this plant that is different? A plant may have something different in the location it is growing, or it may be a less resistant variety. What variety is the affected tomato? Is it the only large fruited tomato in the box? Have you grown this variety before? Do you rotate locations from year to year? Bring a photo of the entire box from a couple angles and be able to show the MGs on duty where the affected tomato is planted and discuss and cultural differences from the rest of the box. Is this plant on the south or west facing side of the box? Were any leaves pruned off exposing the fruit to direct sun? I have a couple of boxes that are not exactly level and that creates watering differences within the same box for example. Anything like that? How do you water your plants and how often? Have you seen any insects? Is there a critter inside the fruit where those holes shown in the pictures? These kinds of things are what the MGs will need to know to try and help you figure out what is going on. The help desk is located at 4077 SW Research Way in Corvallis. Be sure to call first to ensure a MG is on duty. Office hours are 8-5 M-F. The phone number is 541-766-6750.

  - Fungal spores of Early Blight can overwinter on leaf debris in the soil but they also overwinter on other plants and the spores can blow or splash to your plants.  You can't inoculate your tomatoes 100% but you can grow resistant plants and use good culturalpractices toreduce the incidence of the disease like providing good air circulation, keeping water off the leaves, picking off leaves when the first symptoms appear, and cleaning up debris every fall.

I think it will be a bit of a drive from Erie County New York to Lapeer, Michigan. Not to worry, I will try to help you.When you can tomatoes in their own juice, as the tomatoes cook and make the juice, sometimes bubbles will appear because the tomato tissue will release the air that was held in the cell tissue.Sometimes when the food product is boiling so furiously after being canned, air becomes trapped in various places in the food product.For future reference, just because the jar seals does not mean that it is safe. Following the correct procedures is more important.One of the keys to safety is that you acidified the tomatoes.The salt in this case if purely for flavor. In the low amount, it does not have a preservation activity. The only time salt is a preserving agent is in pickling and preserving meat jerky.Your picture did not come clear enough for me to see where the air bubbles are located. But as I have explained it is possible for air to become trapped in the food product.if you have any other questions do not hesitate to ask.sincerely,Chris

  - Hello Paulette!  Tomato hornworms are the larval stage of a moth that lays its eggs directly on the plant leaf.  The only way to "prevent" them would be to cover the tomato plants with some type of netting so that the moths couldn't reach the leaves, but that would make caring for the plants cumbersome.  The recommended treatment is simply scouting. Monitor the plants every few days and remove any hornworms that you find.  They can be difficult to see--I often first notice the droppings and then look in the vicinity for the caterpillar. Note that the insect has two generations each growing season in our environment. For more information on tomato hornworms, and some additional suggestions on combating them, please see the link below:   https://extension.umn.edu/yard-and-garden-insects/tomato-hornworms   Black bottoms on your tomatoes sounds like blossom end rot. Please take a look at the photos in the article at the link below and see if this resembles what youre seeing on your fruit. (It starts out as a much smaller area than shown in the illustration.) Blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency in the plant. This can be due to a lack of calcium in the soil, but is more often due to uneven access to the water which transports the calcium. The article describes several ways that you can minimize this condition.   https://www.canr.msu.edu/resources/blossom_end_rot_tip_sheet   If you would like confirm that your soil has sufficient calcium, you can order an MSU Soil Test Kit here: https://shop.msu.edu/product_p/bulletin-e3154.htm.

  - It is not a safety issue to freeze tomatoes.  They just become more watery.  You can freeze them in several ways.  If you have lots of freezer room just wash them and put them whole in freezer bags.  You don't have to peel them or even take out the core.  When ready to use just run them under a little hot water and they will pop right out of their skin.  You can also crush them and freeze them or you can even  crush them and cook them down to a sauce, cool and then freeze the sauce. It won't be as watery as if you just freeze the uncooked sauce.   If you use high quality freezer bags or containers they will last for a year or more.       If you have a food dehydrator you might like to dry some.  Just slice them about 1/4-1/2 inch thick and place on screen covered dehydrator trays and dry until they are leathery and there are no moisture pockets.  Dried tomatoes are great to crumble up and add to salads or just rehydrate and add to soups or stew.  You can also dip the dried tomatoes quickly into lemon juice and put into olive oil.  They will soften quicker that way.       When I dry my tomatoes I like to sprinkle a little Italian seasoning and garlic powder on them before drying.  They are great for snacking.      Another option is to make some salsa.  You can eat it fresh, can it or freeze it.  OSU Extension has a great publication on home canned salsa PNW 355.  It is easy to make and can. There is also a publication called SP50-920 Preserving Tomatoes that gives other ideas for using excess tomatoes.

You may look at this resource and decide for yourself that it is something different.https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/insects-and-diseases-tomatoesBacterial diseases spread by splashing. Fungal diseases spread from spores in the wind.Even you could spread them ifworking around the plants while they are covered in dew, or splashing in puddles, or brushing against sporulating lesions on plants.It is better to pick under-ripe fruit when plants are diseased to maximize your yield. You can use fruit without spots, or use fruit with spotsmorequickly,and by cuttingout thespotty sections.However, I cannot recommend water bath canning fruit with spots, as the pH can be affected by some diseases.Plant tomatoes in a different row or garden next year.

  - Hi, you are following some good "best practices" for dealing with early blight. We would only add removing lower leaf branches (up to 2 ft. from soil) beginning once plants are well-established and trying some of the cultivars from the NC State University tomato breeding program with moderate levels of resistance to the disease, including 'Mountain Magic,' 'Mountain Supreme,' and 'Mountain Merit.'Fixed copper fungicides work best if started early in the season prior to symptom development.Jon

  - Thank you for your question, Linelle.  Although it may not appear to be much of an issue in September, the cause of splitting is inconsistent watering.  Here is an Extension article explaining how to prevent that:  https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/2079/2014/02/Tomatoes.pdf  You may be able to use the small ones in freezing, but wed need to know the variety of tomato you have to advise.

  - Hello StacyI double checked with our state lab's plant pathologist, and she confirmed that it is Septoria.  She has this to say, "Yes, this looks like Septoria.  Assuming that this is a home garden (not commercial production) there are relatively few chemical control options  including chlorothalonil and copper-based products.  Some copper-based products are organic.  I recommend that the user fully review the label for any pesticide to find application instructions, some of which may pertain to limiting off-target exposure.   It is especially important that the location where the tomatoes are planted be rotated.  This allows time for the amount of the pathogen persisting in the soil to be reduced.  Typically a layer of mulch that creates a barrier between the soil and the foliage is helpful in reducing disease severity.

  - Congratulations on your tomato production! There is nothing like a fresh tomato right off the vine - especially if it is still warm from the sun. Tomato plants are originally from tropical highlands in Central and South America. Of the 2 types of tomatoes, determinate (don't need support) and indeterminate (need support), determinate tomatoes are annuals and indeterminate are perennials in their native regions (Tomato  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato). They are, however, quite susceptible to cold damage. Indeterminate tomatoes can grow for a few years in a greenhouse. Indeterminate tomatoes, then don't have a set life span, just a functional life span.   As long as your plants are producing new growth and fruit keep them going. When the plants start to die off either pull the entire plant and hang it in a dry place, or remove the green tomatoes to a warm, dry area to let as many ripen as possible.

  - This definitely looks like a fungal issue.Although your tomatoes are producing, what are the light conditions in this area? Is it full sun? If ferns were growing there, I would imagine this was a partial shade area? Ferns can certainly spread into sunnier areas, but they become sun scorched in full sun. Small zucchinis could have resulted from not enough sun, but low nutrients can contribute to that, too.I am curious about your site conditions first. Tomatoes (and zucchinis) can certainly fall victim to fungal issues, which is what appears to have happened to your tomatoes, but knowing a bit more about your site and soil conditions can help me give you some advice on how to grow healthier plants.Let me know a few more details about your light and soil conditions and I can follow-up with some recommendations for the future.

  - Hello,If you haven't had diseases, you can continue to grow in the beds, BUT you could consider planting the tomatoes in containers every other year.Clear plastic solarization will really only work when temperatures are hot, so doing it now wouldn't generate enough heat to kill off any disease or insects. It's most effective in July and August.Also focus on buying clean, high-quality plants. Consider growing them yourself from seed if you want to further break the potential disease cycle.

  - Potting soil is for pots.  Garden soil is too heavy and may contain various soil borne pathogens which will infect your tomatoes.  There are granular fertilizers labels for tomatoes.  Add some of that to your soil and mix it in before you plant.  That will last for a long time.  You do not want a fertilizer that is high in nitrogen (the first number) as that promotes a lot of leaves at the expense of fruit.  You can plant them when danger of frost is over.  Tomatoes need consistent moisture.  Here is a link: https://extension.umn.edu/vegetables/growing-tomatoes

  - Below Ive listed general requirements for tomatoes.  You will be battling both weather and lack of sun.   Consider transplanting to a pot and growing indoors or in a well lit garage.  On the other hand, you have nothing to lose by testing for yourself.        Soil 	temperature should be above 65 degrees Fahrenheit.  Soil 	thermometers are fairly inexpensive.  	  Air 	temperature should be above 60 degrees Fahrenheit for good 	performance.  	  Direct 	sunlight of seven or more hours daily for good growth and fruit 	ripening.  	  Pollination 	can be accomplished by shaking the plant.  	  You need to 	know your cultivar and type to determine growth habit and length of 	season.   	  	  Tomato 	cultivars mature over a wide range of time, commonly from 50 days 	for early cherry types to 60 days for early, full-size fruit types; 	75 days for mid-season maturing cultivars; and 85 days for later, 	full-season cultivars from transplants.  	  	  Plants under 	plastic row covers accumulate two to three times more heat than 	those without covers. Remove the covers when plants begin to flower 	or if temperatures under the covers become excessive. Dont allow 	temperatures to exceed 90F for more than 2 or 3 consecutive days.

  - Reusing the soil can work but it can come with a cost.  If your tomatoes had insect or disease problems the soil should probably be changed. If you used chemical fertilizers, build up of salts can be a problem but can be flushed from the soil.  Soil nutrients can be depleted and need to be replenished in the spring. It really gets down to inconvenience versus the chance disease, insects, et al .  If you change the soil, disinfect, the container, also.Planting a cover crop is a good practice.  Weed control, erosion control, soil building, nutrient building are some of the benefits.  Unfortunately it is probably too late in the season to plant a cover.

  - Salsa, a mixture of tomatoes (green or red) or tomatillos and onions, peppers, etc. must be adequately acidified to be safely canned. We recommend that you start with a recipe that has been tested to be certain that the acid level is high enough so that dangerous pathogens, including botulism, cannot grow once it is sealed in the jar. We dont have the ability to analyze a recipe or a product that has already been made to determine if there is enough lemon or lime juice for the amount of other vegetables that are there. I would suggest freezing the productyou havemade, which is safe regardless of the amount of acid added. Check this publication for guidelines and a good recipe for green salsa that can be canned. https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/pnw395 To make salsa unique, you can add or subtract any spices, but the ratio of vegetables to acid should remain the same as a tested recipe indicates.

  - Good Morning,As a general rule, unopened home canned foods have a shelf life of one year and should be used before two years.  My suggestion is to toss the product; I encourage all to err on the side of caution when it comes to food safety.  Several factors limit the shelf-life of canned foods.  Cans or metal lids on glass jars can rust. When rust is deep enough, tiny holes open in the can or lid that may let spoilage agents in. Can corrosion. Food reacts chemically with the metal container, especially high-acid food like canned tomatoes and fruit juices. Over several years, this causes taste and texture changes. It eventually lowers the nutritional value of the food. Temperatures over 100 degrees F are harmful to canned foods. The risk of spoilage jumps sharply as storage temperatures rise. At prolonged storage temperatures above 75 F, nutrient loss in canned foods increases. Light can cause color changes and nutrient losses in foods canned in glass jars.

  - Hi- it is best to harvest now, prior to a killing frost. Typically, fruits that are mature green 9full-size and may show a white cross on the blossom-end) will ripen further indoors. Placing these tomatoes in a bag with, or in close proximity to, apples or bananas will hasten ripening (from exposure to ethylene gas). If green fruits are not mature they will not ripen indoors.The flavor and eating quality of these late fruits is greatly diminished compared to the summer harvest. Alternately, there are many recipes that involve green tomatoes.Jon

  - Thanks for the question.   Tomato blight is quite common in Minnesota and may be difficult to completely prevent. You certainly have discovered this. One of the simplest ways to do this is only planting tomatoes that are resistant to blight. You can easily determine this by looking for the designation EB Resistant on the labels of the tomatoes you purchase. The fungal spores responsible for this disease are carried by the wind from plant to plant. This is the major reason why you did not see the blight on the tomatoes you had covered. Unfortunately by covering tomatoes you may damage the plant by limiting available light. Also, this covering may decrease the amount of insect and wind pollination that might occur. This would result in reduced tomato production. The fungal spores typically remain in the ground over the winter in the soil and/or tomato plant debris. For 2020 besides using blight resistant tomatoes, I would suggest you plant your tomatoes in a spot as far removed as possible from the planting location you used in 2019.   Here are some publications that will provide you further information on these and other points regarding tomato blight:   https://extension.umn.edu/diseases/early-blight-tomato   http://www.tomatodirt.com/tomato-blight-early.html   https://extension.umn.edu/diseases/late-blight   https://www.thespruce.com/early-blight-on-tomato-plants-1402973   Thanks for using this forum.

  - Hi - I'm assuming you are getting early blight, the most common disease of tomatoes. But, there are other diseases (i.e. - septoria, late blight) that may be the culprint.   As soon as you see this disease present, please bring us a sample to:   490 S. Broad St, Canfield, OH.   Again, most likely you are dealing with early blight. This disease lives in the soil (and surrounding soil) and is present every year. There is no way to prevent it by changing the soil.   Have you done a soil test with us before? If so, I can look it up to look at your values.   Next, look at this factsheet about this disease and determine if you think this matches what you are seeing each season:http://go.osu.edu/earlyblight   As for the disease, it is soil borne - but usually spread by water. So, it is important to 'lift' the tomatoes and space them out correctly to avoid water splashing the disease on the leaves and increasing the ability of the leaves to dry off as quickly as possible in the morning. Here are some things to look at as far as tying, lifting, etc. from our organic tomato information page:   http://go.osu.edu/liftingtomatoes   Also, usingnewspapers undersomekind of mulchwillpreventthesplashingevent-wherewater splashesthe diseaseupto the plant'sleaves.

  - For most home gardeners, we don't recommend it. It is difficult to do, and the success rate is low. Special set-ups (growing chambers) are used. As long as the home gardener has been adding organic matter and has good soil--and no serious chronic disease problem, such as fusarium, that can't be avoided--then it isn't worth the effort and cost. Outcomes are as good in a typical garden.For the curious, we recommend first purchasing some plants and experimenting with them. If you decide to use your purchased seeds, there are good tutorials online, such as at Johnny's Seeds. We'd be glad to hear about your experience.Ellen

It indicates that no fungicides are labeled for control.

## 131928_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/131928_Michigan
  - There are many reasons that tomato crops can fail. Lack of nutrients, too much or too little water, pH, insect pests, diseases, etc can all be factors. To get a handle on nutrient issues and pH, it is a good idea to get a soil test (http://homesoiltest.msu.edu/). You can then make the appropriate adjustments. Soil moisture needs to be "wrung sponge" wet, not soggy or dry and must be consistent. Mulching around the plant will help. Avoid overhead watering. Wet leaves is an invitation for disease. Pests and diseases need to be handled in a timely manner.  Consider disease resistant varieties. Check out the following links for additional information:

  - It's difficult to say what the main issue was for the tomatoes. It's possible that the heirloom varieties were more susceptible to heat damage in summer. Pollen can be killed by high temperatures, and warm overnight temperatures can trigger sensitive plants to abort flowers for form smaller fruit. There could be other environmental stresses too, such as soil moisture levels, nutrient levels, and even localized root damage from something that didn't bother the hybrids. Poor pollination could be one reason - bumblebees don't do well in high heat, for instance - but this likely would have affected the hybrids as much as the heirlooms.'Cherokee Purple' is a variety that has been produced as agrafted plant for the purposes of increasing productivity. If yours havebeen seed-grown, using grafted plants this year is worth a try.

A greater risk to your plants than diseases "jumping" beds, is that the insects and diseases that were in the soil last year will cause problems for the tomatoes.

Maybe this is to help with the future location in an acidic planting bed? Im not sure, you could possibly submit this question to where you found it on the web.Seedling mixes should not be high in quick release fertilizer in order to not damage the fragile seedlings. Biochar, worm castings, fishbone meal, bat guano are considered fertilizers that will gradually release nutrients.I know you only inquired about the lime and fertilizers, but this recipe calls for large amounts for each ingredients.

  - Excellent question!  The National Center for Home  Food Preservation has answered this previously. They are an organization that has the facilities to  test food safety issues. They bring up some  valid points.  NCFHFP - "We have no safe tested processes to do this. In  some cases, the way the heat is distributed throughout the jar during  canning will be very different if you start with already canned/cooked  food than with fresh.  Excessively  softened foods will pack more tightly into a jar, or arrange themselves  differently and the process time recommended for fresh foods will not  be enough for the already canned foods.  Under processing can lead to foodborne illness or at the very least, spoilage and loss of product. You  definitely could not just transfer the food and "seal" the jar. You  would need some heat treatment known to destroy any organisms  transferred with the food." source - http://nchfp.uga.edu/questions/FAQ_canning.html#32 Also, the tomatoes have already been processed. If you process them again, they will turn onto total mush, while not being safe. Your best bet is to freeze them in small, re-usable containers or freezer bags. That isthe only way you can assure they are safe.

## 134290_Oregon

  - Thank you for your question. I suspect your tomato starts need more nutrients (fertilizer.) This is the time in their development that they need food to grow leaves, and then flowers and fruits (eventually). Get some fertilizer made specifically for tomatoes and/or tomato starts. Fish fertilizer is actually not a very good one for these plants. The yellowing and leaves falling off is indicative of too little nitrogen (the first number on the X-X-X label on fertilizers.) Only water when the soil is dry when you put your finger in the soil (or invest in a cheap soil water meter.) Hope this is helpful. Good luck!

## 134331_Oregon

  - An interesting problem. The raised bumps on the leaf and veins may be edema, POSSIBLY caused by high humidity, excessive water in the soil, and low light conditions. I doubt that safer soap caused that problem. If it is edema, it is just a physiological condition and not a disease or pest effect. I expect that transplants will grow out of that in the next two weeks given predicted weather. The light green leaves are typical of plants growing rapidly under low light conditions, and we have had quite a stretch of low light days. If you are using supplemental light, that is probably not the problem.Tomatoes are somewhat tolerant to over-watering, but if you are applying nutrients in the water, there is the possibility of over fertilization, and too much nitrogen can cause excessive growth and delay flowering. How are you monitoring soil moisture now? Are you using soil moisture sensors, or estimating water delivery based on flow rates and time? Once fruiting begins, even watering is important to avoid blossom end rot. Until then, letting the surface dry between waterings and stressing the plants a bit will not harm them.

  - Thank you for your question. Without knowing the specific disease it is difficult to zero in on a few varieties. Early blight, septoria leaf spot, viruses, insects and nutrients, et al can all cause yellow leaves.  I would expect early blight may be the most common.  There are several varieties that have resistance to early blight. Septoria leaf spot is also common.  Take a look at the following links for the resistant varieties that have characteristics you are looking for (size,  early, late, midseason, etc.).

  - I am sorry to tell you I believe you have damping off.  It is a soil born disease.  Looking at your photo, I wonder if your plastic cups have good drainage.  Also, the high sides prevent the breeze created by the fan from reaching the soil.  Overwatering is a common cause.  You would have to turn each plant out and see if there are any good roots.  If the stem is mushy it is too late.  On good plants, put them in clean containers with new soil.  Wash you hands in between touching plants to avoid transferring the fungi.  The lights should be closer to the top of your plants, within 2-3 inches and the soil warm.  Here is a link: https://extension.umn.edu/solve-problem/how-prevent-seedling-damping

  - Blossom end rot, one of the most prevalent tomato problems. Usual cause is a water imbalance such as the soil is too wet, too dry. It is critical to monitor your watering and maintain consistent levels of moisture during the growing season. Calcium moves thru the plant with an ample and consistent water supply. So an inadequate uptake of calcium from the soil to leaves and fruit will cause the end rot. Keep in mind that the plant will require more water when it is hot and dry. With consistent watering the plant should be able to take up enough calcium from the soil.Have you had a soil test done? This would confirm whether your soil is calcium deficient or not. Generally speaking most soils contain adequate amounts of calcium. Highly recommend a soil test prior to adding any nutrients to soil.

  - Thank you for your question, Amy.  The process youre onto is calledhardening off in a manner not to shock the seedlings, but protect them from too much too soon.  You can set them in full sun so long it is this warm.  You need to make sure the wind does not dry them out, or that the soil dries out over the day.  It is unlikely to get into the 80s, which would be too hot for most, and can even cause leaf scorch.

  - Thank you for your question. Tomato "blight" is a set of symptoms that is caused by various factors usually bacterial or fungal pathogens. These pathogens can be seed borne, airborne, soil borne, et al. Preventative spraying is one method to keep these diseases at bay. Starting to spray a week after transplanting is not uncommon. Be sure to read the label and wear the appropriate personal protective equipment.  Resistant varieties of tomatoes is a very good way to limit problems but they are not always effective.

## 135185_Minnesota

  - Thanks for your question. It is a highly appropriate one since various tomato fungal spores could potentially over winter on the cages. Although I have often wondered if it is really necessary, I treat my cages in the fall after I have harvested my tomatoes and in the spring before putting them in. In both cases, I employ a two-step process. First, I wash the cages with a soap solution so as to remove any dirt and/or grime. Then secondly, I wipe the cages with a bleach solution consisting of one-part household bleach and nine-parts of water. After doing this in the spring, I let the cages sit in the sun for a couple of days before actually using them. I am somewhat puzzled by your reference to a trough. I dont know if this is where you will be placing the cages or if you will be growing tomatoes in a trough without cages. If the former, my answer would be unchanged. If you are growing tomatoes in a trough without cages, then be sure that all previous years plant debris is removed. It becomes somewhat challenging to disinfect the actual soil. Here are some other thoughts about this issue: https://homeguides.sfgate.com/use-bleach-tomato-blight-34944.html http://solitarygardener.blogspot.com/2012/03/sterilize-your-tomato-cages.html Good luck!!

  - Hi- the symptoms in the photos are most likely caused by some minor environmental stress. We don't think it's due to too much or too little fertilizer. Some possibilities: the containers are small for the plant size (good that you are potting up to larger containers), grow mix is too wet (allow the top of the mix to dry slightly before watering), temperature fluctuations, plants growing into or above lights.Remove the lower leaves that are affected. There is a large enough fertilizer "charge" in the grow mix to carry the plants along for 6-8 weeks so no need to fertilize. Let us know if the problem worsens after you move them into larger containers.You may want to adjust your seeding time next year so that you have 6-7 week old transplants when you are close to your final spring frost date:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/when-plant-vegetables-marylandGrowing transplants: https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/starting-seeds-indoorsJon

## 135849_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/135849_Michigan
  - HelloThank you for your question.From the photos, it looks like your tomato seedlings are too dry. Especially with you using the peat pots, they will dry out even faster because the peat acts like a wick and really soaks up any water, i.e. takes it away from the seedlings' roots. I would suggest you thoroughly moisten both the soil and the peat pots with lukewarm water. You might need to do this a few times to get the peat wet.I'm thinking that once you do this and repeat the fertilizer application when the directions tell you, they will green up. I'm assuming that you used an all purpose, e.g 10-10-10 fertilizer? You always want to make sure they are well watered before you apply fertilizer, so you don't burn the plant's roots.Then, when they are dry, repeat this watering process. You could also add a little compost or worm castings to the top of your pots and this will slowly add nutrients over time.It looks like they are getting nice light because they are not stretching. If you're using supplemental fluorescent or LED lighting, you can place the lights a 1/2 inch away from the foliage.

## 135873_Michigan
* askextension_tomato/135873_Michigan
  - Thank you for the question.  Atfirst look this seems to indicate a possible cultural problem.  It seems most of the damage appears on tips of leaves indicating inadequate water getting to these points. This could be due to either underwatering of overwatering. This could also be true of other leaves that appeared to have wilted at some point.  Dry drafts and light watering could be one explanation. What looks like wilting damage can also be related to leaves touching a warm light.  A look at the roots could help determine if there may be a problem underground.  Watering from the bottom is a good practice to help prevent damping off.  Another issue is the purple appearance of the lower leaves that result of inadequate phosphorous or the plants getting cold. Seedlings do not do well at temperatures below 60F.  The problem that is most worrisome is the black tips.  This could be a fungal, viral, or bacterial.  Diseases can be seed borne, soil borne, or airborne. Saved seed can harbor diseases. Get seeds from a reputable source. A sterile soilless mix should always be used when germinating seeds. You should always disinfect tools, pots, and trays before use. Removal of damaged leaves using sanitized scissors is probably in order as long as you are not denuding the plant. Isolate damaged plants if you suspect disease. Let us know if you have further problems and need additional assistance.I hope this is helpful,

See this: https://extension.umn.edu/diseases/tomato-mosaic-virus-and-tobacco-mosaic-virus The bumpy leaves look similar.

  - It would be helpful to have a picture of the full plant and scale of how bit the plants are. You may be watering them too much at this point as they look relatively large. Daily watering/misting is important for seed germination but once the plants get to size, you should be able to back off of the watering: keep it consistent but you don't need to do it daily as the plants mature.

  - You can plant the Mortgage Lifter Tomato in a container with good results. However, the diameter and depth of the container, environmental considerations will affect the plants ability to produce. Tomatoes grow best in 8 hours of full sun. They also need a soil temperatures of 65 degrees. When planting zucchini in a container that is round, you will need to have a strong horizontal trellis to hold the demands of the plant. This plant will also need at least 6 hours of sun for proper development.

  - Not sure why your tomatoes are yellowing. Give them as much light as possible. Do they have drainage? Let them dry out between waterings. You would be better off just direct seeding the peas and beans. The peas can be planted now. The beans not until late May. The germination time is fairly short on both. Cucumbers get too long very quickly I would just direct seed those as well once the ground is warm. Late May to the first of June. Here is a link to info that should be helpful.

The timing intervals depend on the fungicide chosen and disease pressure at the particular site as well as the statements on the respective pesticide label.  The fungicide labels will clearly state the legal intervals and give recommendations for the particular formulation.  If you are asking for a home garden or organic production, focus on the materials that have an H in the box (home gardens) or O in the box (organic producers) at the end of each respective list statement on the PNW handbook website.

  - The color spectrum of the lighting in the photo makes it difficult to pick out any specific symptoms, however we do not see clear evidence of pests or disease. Therefore, yes, environmental conditions are suspect. That said, you can still monitor them for signs of whitefly, fungus gnats, spider mites, or other common indoor pests; check underneath the leaves, and you can use a yellow sticky trap (essentially a bright yellow card covered in adhesive) hung or clipped nearby to capture flying adult insects.Often, ailing indoor plants are over- or under-watered, as soils in small containers can change moisture levels at varying speeds depending on plant age, soil composition, drainage of the container, household temperatures and humidity, and so forth. The soil should be allowed to dry out some between thorough waterings. You can try to gently pop the plant out of its container and examine the roots. Any browning or mushy roots indicate rot from over-watering. Firm, whiter roots should be healthy. The tray the pots appear to be in could be collecting water draining from the pots and allowing the soil to remain too moist for too long, depriving the roots of needed oxygen. In this case, nothing can be done except to water the plants less frequently and wait for replacement root growth. Letting the plants drip-dry over a sink after watering, before replacing them on the tray, may help with this.You can feel the leaves after several hours of "daylight" to see if they feel much warmer than ambient temperatures. If so, they may be receiving too much light and the height of the lamp should be adjusted. They also likely do not need the benefit of the heat mat any longer unless the ambient home temperatures are cool. We assume those plants receiving sunlight in the window box are still indoors, as it is still too cold outside for tomatoes. In their case, perhaps the pots got too dry for a period and the leaves became a bit scorched.Miri

  - Hi- your tomato plants are showing classic symptoms of environmental stress caused by one or more of the following- whipping winds, rapid temperature changes, temperature extremes, changes in light duration, and intensity. The hardening-off process should be started just 7-10 days prior to when you expect to set them out in the garden.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/vegetable-seedlings-transplants-problems'If they are getting severely pot-bound you may want to consider moving them into larger containers. It may be 2-3 weeks before you'll be able to plant. Next year, consider starting later so that you are setting out 6-week old plants.Beans are self-fertile and it's actually rare to have cross-pollination (pollination occurs even before the flowers open). If the bean plants are pole beans you probably planted pole bean seed. It's hard to tell the difference when plants are young prior to vining.Jon

  - Hi- the flies are fungus gnats, flies that lay their eggs in organic matter. Larvae feed on fungi and plant roots. They are common in high humidity, high-temperature environments where the grow mix stays overly moist. You can look for the larvae in the top inch of your growing media. Let the top of your media dry a bit before watering. They are not considered a big problem and no controls are required. Fungus gnats can be brought into the home on infested plants but they are fairly ubiquitous in homes in our region.https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/fungus-gnats-houseplantsThe white insect is probably whitefly. (there are white aphids but usually only the females fly during mating. If they are aphids you will see two short "tail pipes" emerging from their backsides). Whitefly immatures sit on the plants, they don't fly. Adults fly off when disturbed. Whitefly can survive indoors year-year on housplants, herbs, and transplants. With climate change, they are probably overwintering outside in urban areas.Yes, insecticidal soap will control whitefly.

  - Hi- it would be best to wait another week, at least. Ideally, night temps should be in the mid-50s and the soil temperature should be above 60 degrees F. The plants will just sit there and not grow under cool conditions and are then susceptible to injury from frost and whipping winds. Also, you will see more catfacing of fruits (rough, misshapen bottoms) when plants are exposed to temps below 50-55 degrees F.However, we understand that sometimes you have to plant because transplants have grown too large to manage easily indoors under lights. In that case, just be prepared to protect plants with some type of cover (e.g., paper bags, floating row cover, blanket) if frost is precited.

  - This is not enough information to develop a diagnosis or recommendation. They change their appearance drastically with different management over the course of a few hours when they are this small.The most common problems with vegetable transplants are that they are watered too much, lighted too little, kept too cold, and held too long in pots too small.Watering, by far is the number one problem. The pot needs to dry before watering again. Use your finger and feel the soil as far as you can without damaging the roots. If it's moist or wet they don't need more water. As they grow they will soak up more water and you can increase watering. If they are cold, they grow slow, and don't need as much watering.They need 14-16 hours of light a day from a light source kept 1-2 inches above the tops of the plants. A tube light with 1500 to 3200 lumens is adequate.They need 70-75 degrees during the day, and slightly cooler at night. Heating mats can help here, or plastic covers for the pots will help trap heat from the lights.The pot size for tomatoes only matters when you intend to hold them longer than 8 weeks. The roots get crowded and the plant struggles. A 1-2 inch pot is adequate for transplanting within 6 weeks. A pot your size should be adequate.

The scientific method would be to spend +/- $20 to get a soil test, which would give you reliable information about what is going on in the soil, both in terms of pH (which lime will change by making the soil less acidic) and nutrients (the 'food' plants need to create carbohydrates, plant components, and then fruit and seeds.  A &amp; L Western Agricultural Labs (http://www.al-labs-west.com/about-us.php)is a close one. That would give you enough information to know whether adding lime--or anything else--will help your plants, do nothing, or hurt them. Since vegetables need a specific pH range (6.0 to 7.0--the latter being neutral, as with water) to produce, or even stay alive, you would have less chance of enhancing their decline this year.Yourhabitualaddition oflimemayactuallybethecauseoftheirfailingcondition. The second approachis to try (with or without any test results) to do a couple of things that have helped most vegetable crops. The first is to rotate your plants each year, so the same crop doesn't attract the same pests (diseases, insects, etc.) and to utilize one group of nutrients one year, and the second to the fourth year. Here is an Extension article on the topic: https://extension.wsu.edu/snohomish/gardenrotation/  The second 'natural' component is to plant a cover crop or two in the fall, so it can keep nutrients from leaching out in the winter rains, there is less compaction of the soil, and, depending upon the crop, even add nutrients back into the soil. This latter group includes the legume family, ofprimarily beans, vetch and clover.  https://s3.wp.wsu.edu/uploads/sites/2079/2015/06/Cover-Crops-for-Home-Gardens-West-of-the-Cascades-WSU.pdfTheothertactyoucan takeistouse bothstrategies,butyou'llprobablyneedtodosomeadvance planningtogetthemaximumresults.Hopethisishelpful.Goodluck!

  - Thank you for your question.  Members of the  "nightshade" family need to be rotated to avoid pest (insect and disease) infestations, as well as to allow the soil to be restored with nutrients removed the past year.  Here is an Extension article specifically on tomatoes (for a commercial crop, but same crops): https://www2.ipm.ucanr.edu/agriculture/tomato/crop-rotation/and here is  a scientific article for the home gardener: https://extension.wsu.edu/snohomish/gardenrotation/There are a lot of sources on the Internet with advice. We provide only advice that has been researched at one or more Agricultural Universities nationally. The nutritional addition is probably the easiest soil condition to change (although getting an accurate soil pH and nutrient test gives you reliable information).  (http://www.al-labs-west.com/about-us.php)It is the soil diseases and insects that are not seen, and which it is more difficult to cure. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!

  - Thank you for choosing Ask an Expert for help determining whether its time to get those tomatoes outside. Soil temperature is more important than air temperature, cause the roots (which sustain the plant) are in the soil. The Oregon State Universitys Hyslop Weather Station tracks soil temperature throughout the year. Though it is a few miles south of us, it gives an excellent picture of whats going on. See here: https://agsci.oregonstate.edu/hyslop-weather-station   You will see that their soil temperature at four inches in hovering above the high 50snot unreasonable for tomato starts.   That said, some of the answer to your question depends on your soil conditions. Clay soil warms up slower than a raised bed. North-facing slopes warm up later than south-facing ones.    For more perspective, there are a number of folks tracking soil temperature in our area. Searching on the phrase soil temperature portland gets a few reliable sites.

  - Your first picture looks like slug damage. Slugs and snails scrape the leaves of plants leaving damaged areas on the leaves. The scraped areas then fall out creating the irregular holes characteristic of slug damage. To confirm slug damage place a flat container with beer in the area. You should see the slugs there the next day. Slugs are nocturnal, so you don't see them often on sunny days. If you go out at night you'll find them.  You canthen put them into a container of soapy water to dispose them.  This site has very good information on slugs and slug control with links to other information on its site, How to Identify Snail or Slug Damage  http://www.allaboutslugs.com/how-to-identify-slug-or-snail-damage/.   Your second and third pictures look like physiological leaf roll, because most of the leaves on the plants look green and healthy. This occurs often in the spring especially with newly planted tomatoes. It's an unbalance of root development to leaf growth. When you plant a tomato its roots are not fully developed. It tries to put on vigorous top growth, but the roots cannot keep up with the demands of the growth. It is seen first in lower leaves and older leaves. If severe can affect all leaves. Causes are environmental conditions and include: transplant shock, heat, drought, excess water, root injury, high nitrogen fertilizer which stimulates growth, and severe pruning. To prevent physiological leaf roll harden off the plants prior to planting, choose different cultivars, maintain consistent soil moisture (mulch really helps), fertilize carefully with nitrogen to prevent overgrowth, and protect the plants from root injury. Other causes for tomato leaf roll include chemical injury with herbicides, especially 2,4-D, and viruses. Unless severe, this should not affect the fruit yield or quality. This article has a good discussion of physiological leaf roll, Why in the Heck are my Tomato Leaves Curling? http://hyg.ipm.illinois.edu/article.php?id=498.

  - Hi- straight rows seem to work best for most gardeners. You'll need a minimum of 2 ft. between plants (you could space them closer if you are staking them and pruning to a single stem) and 4-5 ft. between rows. This will help with air circulation between plants (reducing disease incidence), make plant management easier, and increase yields.Jon

  - Hi- the most likely cause of these symptoms is environmental stress- cold weather, wide temperature swings, wind, and many overcast days. It's possible that a small beetle chewed the round holes but it's more likely that the holes are the result of dead plant tissue falling out. The white flecking is also asymptomof thrips feeding so use a hand lens to search the affected leaves for very small, light green, wedge-shaped insects. Unless a large number are seen, no control action is necessary. Thrips are able to overwinter on weeds.https://ag.umass.edu/greenhouse-floriculture/photos/thrips-injury-tomato-foliageThe plants will outgrow these symptoms with warming weather and sunshine.Jon

  - Hi there,Thanks for contacting the BCMG Extension. I'll try to help~ it sounds like to me you have a leafminer variety (they turn into flies), and the white dots could be the eggs, which will soon turn into pupae. They leave whitish trails and eat holes in leaves. The best thing to do is to plant your tomato plant in your garden, keep the soil warm by putting black garden plastic around it, and then gently pick off or wipe the leaves clean of the eggs and pupae. They are young, so I don't recommend putting any insecticide on it yet--the sun and warm soil and water will be its best defense right now (not too much water for tomatoes).

  - Hi Sally,Tomatoes plants are easily killed by a light frost so you will want to wait until there is no frost predicted. It looks like there should not be any more frosts for the rest of the month in New Castle. You should be able to plant them at the start of next week but I would check on Sunday/Monday to see if they've change the temperature predictions for the week (looks like there might be a little drop in temperature on Wednesday). Ideally, tomatoes like nighttime temps above 52F but if we waited for that it would be July before we plant! You can also put a milk jug or 2L soda bottle over the plants to help protect the tomato plants and buffer the night temperatures, cut off the bottom of the container and be sure to leave the cap off. You will need to add a few extra ventilation holes in the sides of the container as well. Also be sure to adequately harden off the transplants before planting.Thank you for using Ask an Expert!

  - I live in Delta County (zone 5) and always wait until Memorial Day to plant tomatoes outside. In Houghton, the earliest frost-free date is May 8th and the last frost date is July 10th. There is a 75% probability of frost after May 15, a 50% probability of frost after May 23 and a 25% probability of frost after May 31. About seven to ten days before you transplant any plant you should begin a hardening off process. During the day place the plants in semi shade or inside the high tunnel with shade over the plants. At night bring the plants back inside. I have included links to two articles from the MSU Extension Service. The first is on proper transplant hardening off and the link is here: https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/proper_transplant_hardening_off_may_be_a_deal_breaker_for_your_season The second is on managing microclimate in low tunnels and the link is here: https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/managing_microclimate_in_low_tunnels_for_optimum_crop_performance I hope this information helps.

  - Hello,I always recommend removing any flowers or fruit at the time of planting. As you referenced, this allows the plant to put resources into root development. Flowers and fruit are "expensive" for the plant to produce--and are usually done at the expense of growth and development.I would pinch off the flowers until the nighttime temperatures regulate a little more. You want to make sure that the nights are consistently in the 50s. Tomatoes are very sensitive to chilling injury and this can cause delays in fruit development into the summer. Night temps in the 60s are even better!

  - Transplant tomatoes after all danger of frost has passed. For the first week or so protect the transplants from direct sun by providing some type of shade. This process is called hardening off the transplants. Plant the tomatoes stem an inch or so deeper than they were originally. Plant the tomatoes two to three feet apart if you plant to use tomato cadges. They can be planted a little closer together if you plan to stake the tomatoes. Newly planted tomatoes can be fertilized with a 4-3-3 fertilizer. A thin layer of coffee grounds can be added to the soil to provide additional nitrogen in your garden. Peppers can be treated the same as tomatoes except they should be planted 18 to 24 inches apart. I have included links to two articles from the MSU Extension Service. The first is on proper transplant hardening off and the link is here: https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/proper_transplant_hardening_off_may_be_a_deal_breaker_for_your_season The second article is on growing tomatoes.

  - No. Blossom end rot is caused by a calcium deficiency. Epsom salts add magnesium, not calcium. Yellow leaves at the end of the season are most likely caused by one of the common tomato fungal diseases (septoria leaf spot or early blight). Again, supplying magnesium won't address this.The calcium deficiency that causes BER is not because the soil lacks calcium, but is because the plant can't take it up.  There are several things you can do to reduce BER: don't plant susceptible varieties (such as Romas), water regularly and evenly, don't cultivate around your plant. Also, the first tomatoes on the plant are the most likely to get BER. Later fruit is usually clean. Read here about BER:https://extension.umn.edu/plant-diseases/tomato-disordersAs for tomato blights, standard cultural practices (don't water overhead or at night, don't work around wet plants, mulch, clean up in the fall, rotate crops, and so on) can help.

  - Hi- without a confirmed diagnosis you can't say for sure what has caused your tomato problems. If it was a wilt disease, it's more likely that it was fusarium wilt. In either case, you should look for tomato cultivars with resistance to verticillium wilt and fusarium wilt, races 1, 2, and 3. Cornell U. has an excellent webpage listing disease-resistant vegetable cultivars:http://vegetablemdonline.ppath.cornell.edu/Tables/TableList.htmInformation on wilt diseases of tomato:https://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/fusarium-wilt-tomato-vegetableshttps://extension.umd.edu/hgic/topics/verticillium-wilt-vegetablesYou could also grow tomato in containers to avoid soil-borne diseases.

  - Oh, do I so feel your pain. The two likely culprits are rabbits or squirrels. I've had luck with chicken wire around the raised beds, even just temporarily, I've even had luck just laying the chicken wire gently over the freshly planted veggies. The tender new plants are very tempting to young animals. Once the plants get more mature, they will be less tempting to animals.Another tip with squirrels for later in the summer: They will steal your tomatoes looking for water. If you leave a water source out for most of the summer, they will be less likely to go after your tomatoes.

  - Thank you for the question.  You may be dealing with a couple different problems.  The seed leaves (cotyledons) have the appearance of flea beetles.  Some yellow sticky traps could help to verify this. The white circles could be fungal but without seeing them it would be hard to tell.  If you are missing whole leaves we may be seeing a rodent (perhaps a vole). Setting up a few mouse traps with peanut butter could answer that problem.

  - Thank you for your question.  Without knowing how much water and fertilizer they have had, it is difficult to determine whether they have too much or too little of those, or whether it is a disease or insect.  Curling leaves are an indication of aphids, which suck out food from the plant leaves.  Have you examined them for those?  The tomato photo is too blurry to see what is on the leaves, but I suspect powdery mildew, an airborne fungus that eventually destroys them.  The two plants in the middle are planted too closely, and should have been thinned out.  The cucumbers may have some type of fungus in the soil that is causing their decline.  Frankly, I would suggest tossing these plants, and starting again with new nursery plants in new potting soil, and following the advice in this OSU publication:  https://catalog.extension.oregonstate.edu/em9027  Good luck!
