- Tomato vine & leaf issues? For 8 years I've been growing beautiful tomato plants that produce wonderfully. I rotate where I grow them every few years and amend my soil yearly. I give the plants food once a month. This year I have tons of tomatoes but the plants are drying up at the bottoms and middle. The tops are perfect and the vines are thick but the bottoms and lower middle are dried up. This year the plants, determinent, indeterminent and heirlooms are getting irrigated every 2-3 days depending on weather. However, this year the plants are also getting wet from the sprinkler not drenched but wet. There is no avoiding it. If it's the sprinkler water causing the problem, why aren't the tops burned up too? If I were watering too much, the toms would be split. So what is the problem? Under watering, nutrition or a pest? If nutrition..why are the toms so healthy looking? Any input would be greatly appreciated

- Tomato plants died midsummer 2012. Last year (2011) we lost one tomato plant and pulled it up by the roots and disposed of it. This year on 4 plants the fruit set and then one by one the plants turned brown and had to be destroyed. We got no production this year in 2012. I suspect some kind of fungal disease is present in the soil. Do you have a suggestion?

- Tomato Soup. Hi, I was wondering if there is a safe recipe for making home canned tomato soup? I cannot find anything in my canning books. It seems like you should be able to at least make a base that you can add milk to when you warm it up
