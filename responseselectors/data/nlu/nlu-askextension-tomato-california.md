- For 8 years I've been growing beautiful tomato plants that produce wonderfully. I rotate where I grow them every few years and amend my soil yearly. I give the plants food once a month. This year I have tons of tomatoes but the plants are drying up at the bottoms and middle. The tops are perfect and the vines are thick but the bottoms and lower middle are dried up. This year the plants, determinent, indeterminent and heirlooms are getting irrigated every 2-3 days depending on weather. However, this year the plants are also getting wet from the sprinkler not drenched but wet. There is no avoiding it. If it's the sprinkler water causing the problem, why aren't the tops burned up too? If I were watering too much, the toms would be split. So what is the problem? Under watering, nutrition or a pest? If nutrition..why are the toms so healthy looking? Any input would be greatly appreciated

- My tomato plants have plenty of growth and flowers, but no fruit?  Do I need to trim off some of the growth
