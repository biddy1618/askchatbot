- Last year (2011) we lost one tomato plant and pulled it up by the roots and disposed of it. This year on 4 plants the fruit set and then one by one the plants turned brown and had to be destroyed. We got no production this year in 2012. I suspect some kind of fungal disease is present in the soil. Do you have a suggestion?
