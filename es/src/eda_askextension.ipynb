The trees were watered this past Saturday and seem to be healthy.\\n\\nQuestion: Can these trees be planted now? Currently the soil is not frozen and night time temps are 35 to 40 degrees.\\n\\nI have downloaded and read CMG GardenNotes #633 as a reference.\\n\\nAny advice would be greatly appreciated. \",\n",

To excavated soil, add organic matter (compost, shhagnum peat, etc) at 20% by volume.  Mix thoroughly to homogenize.    \\nInspect rootball for circling roots and tease them out of circling pattern if possible.   Plant tree so that top of rootball is at or a couple inches above grade.   Backfill with amended excavated soil.  Water well and add more soil where settling occurs.\\nMulch planting area with 2-3 inches of wood chips or similar mulch.   Water again to settle mulch.    Water again in a week and continue watering weekly until there is cold and snowcover.  Water again if weather warms, snowcover  melts and soils begin to dry out.\\n\\n(b) to \\\"store\\\" potted spruces temporarily in soil area (N or E exposure better than S or W), dig holes 1.5X as wide and same depth as rootball. Sink pots into holes and backfill.  Mulch surface of rootball in pot with straw or woodchips.   Water rootballs in pots and repeat whenever weather has been warm and there is no snowcover.   Plant spruces in permanent spot next April as per (a) above.\",\n",
