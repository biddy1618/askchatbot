Limitations:

- I have an artichoke plant and it has all these little black specks on it! There was a ladybug on topside of leaf. What are they?
	- Top result should be aphids

- My milkweed have already bloomed, but now there are strange "caterpillars" on the leaves. They are about 3/4 inch long, have black bodies with orange either on the top or bottom.  The insects are fuzzy and I think they are eating the leaves.  Should I try to kill them and if so, how?
    - Top result should be "Tussock moth"

- I found a very large white grub inthe firewood we were splitting. What was it and how to deal with it? 
    - Top result should be "root borer" or "longhorned beetle"

- I found a green worm crawling out of my partially eaten green tomato. Please, what is this pest? How do I control it? Will this entire plant be infected? In the past few days, I have noticed something eating holes in the leaves of this same tomato. They range from pin head to pea size, and the few of the older leaves are 60-70% eaten.
    - Top results "Tomato fruitworm" or "Tomato hornworm"

- I have flying bugs, like over-sized fruit flies, black bodies, translucent wings. They behave a lot like fruit flies, too, except they don't seem interested in fruit - and it's the middle of the winter! They mostly hang around my kitchen sink but they have spread to other rooms of the house, even my upstairs bathroom.
    - top result should be "drain fly" or "sink fly"

- I have owned an indoor plant (and do not know what it is) for about one year. A white powder-like substance is appearing at the ends of many stalks, and sometimes on the edges of leaves. What is this substance, and how can I rid my plant of this problem? 
    - Top result should be "mealybugs" (this is a difficult one)

- We have an almond tree that is producing almonds. Come to find out the almonds are full of worms. Can you help with a what type of worm it is and possibly a plan of action?
    - Top result should be "Navel orangeworm"
