# To Do

* Ground rules for labelling (long-term goal)

* Baseline scores with precision, recall, and misses
* Label the new data from AE
* Synonym list (layman) - initial approach using simple mapping method (lady bug. ladybug - lady beetle) before the search
* Request access to workflow from Ewald or Jasper
* For the Workflow (for running the ) and MLFlow:
    * AutoFlow
* Create the Docker file 
* Contact Jasper and Ewald on the container's access to dev's chatbot API
* True negatives in the test data - compose some samples
* Iterative improvements - to be able to show the improvements in document

* Compose the skeleton for the front-end
* Cut-off

* Focus on improvement of the metrics
* Formulate the particular problems with misses on ranking
* Include links vector comparison


# Some test questions that are failing
* The questions that are related to pests
* Another top level filter - is this pest-related
* Entity extraction - rust roses - What does rust on roses look like?
* Try changing the role composition order - basically fine-tuning
    * find the best order, and see case-by-case where it's failing (look for patterns)
* Add debugging message related to entity order
* Add
