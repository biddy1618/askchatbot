    "descriptionPestNote": "The California oakworm (Phryganidia californica, family Dioptidae) is one of many species of caterpillars that feeds on oaks. It is the most important oak-feeding caterpillar throughout its range, which extends along the coast and through the coastal mountains of California. Damage is most common on coast live oak (Quercus agrifolia) in the San Francisco Bay and Monterey Bay regions. Populations vary unpredictably year to year from very high to undetectably low. Healthy oaks generally tolerate extensive loss of leaves (defoliation) without serious harm, so treatment to control oakworms usually is not recommended.",

    "damagePestNote": "Young oakworm caterpillars skeletonize the leaf surface of native oaks, while older caterpillars chew all the way through the leaf. Partially chewed leaves may turn brown and die. Viewed from a distance, the canopies of damaged trees may appear brown or gray overall because of the dead leaves and because chewed-away foliage makes branches more visible than normal. In some years, overwintering oakworms can completely defoliate trees by May or June. The subsequent summer generation may cause defoliation in July through September. During years when populations are high, oakworms may noticeably defoliate virtually every oak in a neighborhood, sometimes contiguously across acres of oak woodlands. Trees under stress from drought or other factors may decline if defoliated. Healthy trees can tolerate oakworm damage. Because defoliating outbreaks last usually only 1 or 2 years, oakworms rarely cause repeated defoliations that can severely harm or kill otherwise healthy trees. Even when tree health is not threatened, caterpillars and moths may become a nuisance when populations are high. The caterpillars may move from defoliated oaks and travel on other surfaces in large numbers, such as across lawns and up walls of buildings. In the process, they sometimes enter homes and form harmless, but annoying, pupae attached to household surfaces such as drapes and walls. Outbreak Populations Oakworms occasionally become abundant in the landscape, with high (outbreak) populations occurring at irregular intervals followed by several years with no apparent damage. If most of the leaves on an oak have been eaten, many of the caterpillars may become malnourished and eventually die without developing into adults. When outbreaks occur, oakworms can behave differently than during years when they are less common. Once they have extensively defoliated an oak, caterpillars may drop from the tree on silken webs and crawl away, seeking a new supply of food growing nearby. They may feed temporarily on non-oak species, sometimes extensively chewing and defoliating them. Although this may be alarming and annoying, these oakworms are unable to mature on non-oak plants, and most will die before becoming moths.",
    "managementPestNote": "Pesticide sprays applied to control oakworm usually are not warranted to protect the health or survival of oak trees. If you believe trees need protection from defoliation because they are stressed or because defoliation or abundant insects are not aesthetically tolerable, regularly inspect foliage for oakworms and spray least-toxic pesticides only when caterpillars reach levels warranting treatment. Control oakworm and protect oaks with an integrated pest management (IPM) program that relies primarily on the conservation of natural enemies and on good cultural practices. Biological Control Predators, parasites, and natural outbreaks of disease sometimes kill enough oakworms to control populations. Predators Predators include birds, spiders, and predatory insects. Green lacewing larvae (Chrysopa and Chrysoperla species), pirate bugs (Orius species), the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris), and yellowjackets (Vespula and Dolichovespula species) are important oakworm predators. Green lacewing larvae, adults and nymphs of pirate bugs, and soldier bugs feed on oakworm eggs, larvae, and pupae, impaling prey with their tubular, sucking mouthparts. Yellowjackets carry oakworms back to their nests, where the wasp larvae eat them. Parasitic Wasps Two small wasps (Itoplectis behrensii, family Ichneumonidae, and Brachymeria ovata, family Chalcididae) are reported to be the most important parasites. In both species, the wasps’ immature stages—egg, larva, and pupa—occur within oakworm pupae. An irregularly rounded hole chewed by an emerging adult wasp can be seen in parasite-killed oakworm pupae. The adult Brachymeria ovata is stout, black and yellow, and about 1/4 inch long with enlarged rear basal leg segments. The Itoplectis behrensii adult is slender with a long, narrow abdomen and a body length of about 1/4 to 2/3 inch. This wasp is mostly black but has long legs that are orange with yellow and black bands. Parasitic Flies At least two parasitic tachinid flies (Actia flavipes and Hyphantrophaga virillis [formerly Zenillia virillis], family Tachinidae) kill oakworm larvae. The female fly lays one or more eggs on an oakworm. The emerging larvae bore down and feed inside the oakworm. As the parasitized caterpillar begins to pupate, the fly larvae inside kill their host and emerge to form oblong, reddish to dark brown pupal cases that may be seen on or beneath oaks. The dry, deflated skins of tachinid-killed oakworms often remain attached to twigs or bark. Pathogens Naturally occurring pathogens including a nuclear polyhedrosis virus (NPV) and a fungus (Beauveria bassiana) often kill oakworms. Symptoms of virus infection are dark, soft, limp larval carcasses hanging from foliage or twigs; these carcasses eventually degenerate into a sack of liquefied contents. Whitish fungal growth may cover Beauveria -infected oakworms and produce an unpleasant odor. When infected insects are broken, they release pathogen particles, which infect other oakworms. Disease outbreaks rapidly can reduce populations under favorable conditions, although outbreaks are difficult to predict and may not occur until oakworm populations have become high. Cultural Controls Good cultural care of oaks is an essential component of integrated pest management and will enable trees to tolerate moderate levels of defoliation without harm. Healthy trees can better sustain some foliage feeding or defoliation than trees under stress. Provide irrigation only when needed to minimize drought stress. This will depend on whether precipitation has been normal; soil type and conditions such as shallow soil, soil compaction, or the presence of fill or pavement that can divert rain water; location; oak species; and whether the tree recently suffered any root injury. Protect roots and trunks from damage, and properly prune trees when needed. In comparison with pests, the more common and serious problems that injure or kill oaks include inappropriate irrigation, physical injury to trunks and roots, and soil changes such as compaction or changes in the grade. Do not fertilize oaks unless laboratory testing of properly collected leaf samples reveals that a nitrogen deficiency exists. Many landscape trees are stressed or dying because of poor growing conditions and inappropriate cultural care. See publications such as Living Among the Oaks . If considering spraying, monitor regularly to determine whether caterpillars are abundant and to identify the most effective time to spray them. Monitoring is important, because oakworm populations are cyclic in nature, causing the pest to be common in some years and virtually absent in others. Outbreaks do not occur every year, and treatment by spraying is of no benefit during most years. If you hire others to care for your trees, make sure any decision to spray is based on monitoring. Apply least-toxic pesticides if young oakworm caterpillars become abundant. Monitoring Monitor to determine whether insect populations are going up or down, if control is warranted, and, if so, to properly time management efforts. You also should monitor trees at least once after taking control action to assess the effectiveness. Oakworm monitoring Regularly inspect foliage for oakworms or damage. Because caterpillars usually are more abundant in the western part of the tree canopy, concentrate monitoring there to provide an earlier and more sensitive indication of damage. No thresholds have been established, but as a guide inspect 25 young, lighter green shoot terminals, representing the current season’s leaf flush. If you observe more than 8 to 10 oakworms more than 1/4 inch long, defoliation may occur if oaks are not sprayed. Alternatively, a density of 25 oakworms per 100 shoot terminals has been suggested as a treatment threshold. When monitoring, look closely for the presence of predators, parasites, diseased caterpillars, and other evidence of biological control, and record this information. Evidence of natural enemy activity includes dead pupae or eggs with holes from which parasites emerged, oakworms or unhatched eggs that are discolored or darker than normal indicating they may contain parasites, or hatched caterpillar eggs with no evidence of caterpillars or damage. If you have an increasing number of pests but also many natural enemies, wait a few days before using insecticides. Monitor again to determine whether pest populations have declined or if natural enemies are increasing to levels that soon may cause pest numbers to decline. Frass monitoring Frass collection is another monitoring tool. The oakworm caterpillar excretes characteristic droppings, called frass, that fall to the ground beneath the tree. As the caterpillars grow, their dark fecal pellets increase in size. Greater numbers of pellets are produced either from an increased number of oakworms or from increased temperatures, which cause caterpillars to feed faster. Oakworm frass pellets are typically dark brown with a highly sculptured surface and may be observed lodged in bark crevices, spider webs, and ground cover plants beneath infested oaks. To monitor, place 3 to 5 light-colored sticky cards, shallow trays, or cups beneath the canopy at regular intervals, such as a 24-hour period each week. Place these frass traps when no rain or sprinkler irrigation and little wind are expected. Save the frass or record its volume to compare with the amount collected on other sampling dates or from other oaks. Initially you may want to conduct both frass monitoring and foliage inspection. This provides a record of the proportion of leaves eaten or the number of oakworms present and the corresponding density or volume of frass. With experience, frass monitoring alone may estimate caterpillar density and damage and aid in deciding if control is needed. Frass monitoring also helps to estimate the relative age of most oakworms by comparing frass pellet size. Average pellet lengths for first, third, and fifth instar stages are 1/100, 1/50, and 1/20 inches (0.3, 0.6, and 1.4 millimeters) respectively. Certain insecticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) are most effective against younger caterpillars, when smaller frass pellets predominate. Chemical Control Several pesticides of low toxicity to people and natural enemies are available to control oakworms. IPM-compatible pesticides include microbials, botanicals, and insect growth regulators. Although some are available to both homeowners and professional applicators (Table 2), most homeowners lack the equipment and experience to effectively treat large trees.\nTable 2.

C.\nInsect growth regulator\tDiflubenzuron\tNA\tDimilin\nCheck current labels for permitted uses. NA—Not available or availability uncertain.\nWhen hiring a professional applicator, discuss the specific pesticide to be applied and insist on using an IPM-compatible one. Avoid using broad-spectrum insecticides such as carbamates (carbaryl), organophosphates (acephate and malathion), or pyrethroids (fluvalinate and permethrin), because these materials kill both pests and beneficials and may induce outbreaks of spider mites or pest insects. IPM-compatible pesticides provide good control of target pests, reduce secondary outbreaks of other potential pests such as mites, and minimize hazards to people and pets. In part because of their more specialized and selective modes of action, these pesticides often require more knowledge, skill, and careful application to be effective. Some of these pesticides can be mixed and applied together to increase their effectiveness. For example, an insecticide that provides immediate control such as pyrethrins can be combined with a pesticide, such as Bt or diflubenzuron, that acts more slowly to kill insects. Depending on factors such as insecticide choice, application coverage and timing, oakworm abundance, and the presence of nearby untreated trees, more than one application may be needed to provide good control. For example, during outbreak years and when applying Bt (discussed below), two sprays during each oakworm generation in Northern California may be needed to provide good control. Make applications when young and mid-instar oakworms are the most prevalent life stages, typically March through April and July through August. Decide the actual application times by monitoring oakworm populations. Microbials Microbial insecticides are naturally occurring microorganisms or their by-products produced commercially for pest control. Bacillus thuringiensis, commonly called Bt, is the most widely used and has been used effectively against oakworm for many years. Unlike broad-spectrum insecticides that kill on contact, oakworms must eat Bt-sprayed foliage to be killed. Bt destroys the oakworms’ digestive system and causes larvae to stop feeding within about a day. Affected oakworms often die within a few days. Bt is not toxic to most non-caterpillar insects including natural enemies. Timing and thorough spray coverage, especially on the underside of leaves, are crucial for effective application.\tApply Bt during warm, dry weather when oakworms are feeding actively. Young caterpillars are most susceptible to Bt. Because sunlight quickly decomposes Bt on foliage, most oakworms hatching after the application are not affected.\tA second application about 7 to 10 days after the first may be required.\tSome users add insecticidal soaps, oils, or pyrethrins to increase the efficacy of Bt sprays.\tBe sure to follow label directions for mixing and applying.\tSpinosyns insecticides (i.e. spinosad) are produced by fermentation and are by-products from the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa . Spinosyns are toxic to most caterpillars, fly larvae, thrips, and certain species of beetles and wasps. They are one of the most effective microbials and have relatively low toxicity to people and the adults of many natural enemies. Botanicals Botanical pesticides are derived from plants. One of the most common botanical insecticides, pyrethrum, is from chrysanthemum flowers grown in Africa and South America. This botanical is comprised of insecticidal compounds including several pyrethrins. The most effective products containing pyrethrins also include the synergistic compound piperonyl butoxide, which strengthens the effect. Insects may be only temporarily paralyzed (knocked down) and may recover from the effects of exposure to pyrethrins unless piperonyl butoxide is added. Other Contact Sprays During outbreaks when oakworms migrate to non-oaks, they can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural or narrow-range oil (Sunspray, Volck), insecticidal soaps (Safer), or pyrethrins and soap combined (Safer Yard & Garden Insect Killer). Because these migrating oakworms cannot complete development on non-oaks and will die without producing another generation, consider not treating non-oak species and exercising patience until the oakworm outbreak subsides.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Bark beetles, family Scolytidae, are common pests of conifers (such as pines) and some attack broadleaf trees. Over 600 species occur in the United States and Canada with approximately 200 in California alone. The most common species infesting pines in urban landscapes and at the wildland-urban interface in California are the engraver beetles, the red turpentine beetle, and the western pine beetle (See Table 1 for scientific names). In high-elevation landscapes, such as the Tahoe Basin area or the San Bernardino Mountains, the Jeffrey pine beetle and mountain pine beetle are also frequent pests of pines. Two recently invasive species, the Mediterranean pine engraver and the redhaired pine bark beetle, colonize various Mediterranean pines, which are widely planted in and around the Los Angeles Basin and the Central Valley. Cedar and cypress bark beetles attack arborvitae, cypress, false cypress, junipers, and redwoods. The fir engraver attacks white and red fir at high-elevation locations. Oak bark and ambrosia beetles attack oaks and certain other broadleaf trees including California buckeye and tanbark oak. A long-time (naturalized) invasive bark beetle called the shothole borer attacks damaged branches and trunks of many broadleaved tree species, including fruit trees and English laurel. Two other invasive species, the European elm bark beetle and the banded elm bark beetle feed on elms and vector Dutch elm disease fungus (Ophiostoma novo-ulmi). In its native habitat in Asia, the banded elm bark beetle reportedly also feeds on certain non-elm tree species. California now has 20 invasive species of bark beetles, of which 10 species have been discovered since 2002. The biology of these new invaders is poorly understood. For more information on these new species, including illustrations to help you identify them, see the USDA Forest Service pamphlet, Invasive Bark Beetles\t(PDF). Other common wood-boring pests in landscape trees and shrubs include clearwing moths, roundheaded borers, and flatheaded borers. Certain wood borers survive the milling process and may emerge from wood in structures or furniture including some roundheaded and flatheaded borers and woodwasps. Others colonize wood after it has been placed in structures, such as carpenter ants, carpenter bees, powderpost beetles, and termites. For more information on these other borers, see the Pest Notes listed in References .",

    "damagePestNote": "Bark beetles mine the inner bark (the phloem-cambial region) on twigs, branches, or trunks of trees and shrubs. This activity often starts a flow of tree sap in conifers, but sometimes even in hardwoods like elm and walnut. The sap flow (pitch tube) is accompanied by the sawdustlike frass created by the beetles. Frass accumulates in bark crevices or may drop and be visible on the ground or in spider webs. Small emergence holes in the bark are a good indication that bark beetles were present. Removal of the bark with the emergence holes often reveals dead and degraded inner bark and sometimes new adult beetles that have not yet emerged. Bark beetles frequently attack trees weakened by drought, disease, injuries, or other factors that may stress the tree. Bark beetles can contribute to the decline and eventual death of trees ; however only a few aggressive species are known to be the sole cause of tree mortality. In addition to attacking larger limbs, some species such as cedar and cypress bark beetles feed by mining twigs up to 6 inches back from the end of the branch, resulting in dead tips . These discolored shoots hanging on the tree are often referred to as “flagging” or “flags.” Adult elm bark beetles feed on the inner bark of twigs before laying eggs. If an adult has emerged from cut logs or a portion of a tree that is infected by Dutch elm disease, the beetle’s body will be contaminated with fungal spores. When the adult beetle feeds on twigs, the beetle infects healthy elms with the fungi that cause Dutch elm disease. Elms showing yellowing or wilting branches in spring may be infected with Dutch elm disease and should be reported to the county agricultural commissioner.",
    "managementPestNote": "Except for general cultural practices that improve tree vigor, little can be done to control most bark beetles once trees have been attacked. Because the beetles live in the protected habitat beneath the bark, it is difficult to control them with insecticides. If trees or shrubs are infested, prune and dispose of bark beetle-infested limbs. If the main trunk is extensively attacked by bark beetles, the entire tree or shrub should be removed. Unless infested trees are cut and infested materials are quickly removed, burned, or chipped on site, large numbers of beetles can emerge and kill nearby host trees, especially if live, unattacked trees nearby are weakened or stressed by other factors. Never pile infested material adjacent to a live tree or shrub. Cultural Control Tree Selection Plant only species properly adapted to the area. Learn the cultural requirements of trees, and provide proper care to keep them growing vigorously. Healthy trees are less likely to be attacked and are better able to survive attacks from a few bark beetles. Where bark beetles have been a problem, plant nonhost trees. For instance, engraver beetles and red turpentine beetles do not attack redwoods or atlas cedars. A mixture of tree and shrub species in planted landscapes will reduce mortality resulting from bark beetles and wood borers. Reduce Tree Stress Pay particular attention to old, slow-growing trees, crowded groups of trees, and newly planted trees in the landscape. Large nursery stock or transplanted trees, notably oaks and pines, can become highly susceptible to bark beetles or wood borers after replanting. Transplanting success depends on the tree species and its condition, appropriate tree and site selection, characteristics of the planting site, the season of the year, the transplanting method, and follow-up care. Stresses placed on a tree caused by poor planting or planting at the wrong time of year, lack of proper care afterwards, or the planting of an inappropriate species for the site will increase a tree’s susceptibility to bark beetles or wood borers. Prevention is the most effective method of managing bark beetles and related wood-boring insects; in most instances it is the only available control. Avoid injuries to roots and trunks, damage and soil compaction during construction activities, and protect trees from sunburn (sunscald) and other abiotic disorders. Irrigation may be important during dry summer months in drought years, especially with tree species that are native to regions where summer rain is common. Also, dense stands of susceptible trees should be thinned (complete removal of some of the trees) to increase the remaining trees’ vigor and ability to withstand an attack. Irrigate when appropriate around the outer canopy, not near the trunk. Avoid the frequent, shallow type of watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate trees infrequently, such as twice a month during drought periods. However, a sufficient amount of water must be used so that the water penetrates deeply into the soil (about 1 foot below the surface). The specific amount and frequency of water needed varies greatly depending on the site, size of the tree, and whether the tree species is adapted to summer drought or regular rainfall. Properly prune infested limbs, and remove and dispose of dying trees so that bark- and wood-boring insects do not emerge and attack other nearby trees. Timing of pruning is important; avoid creating fresh pruning wounds during the adult beetles’ flight season. Do not prune elm trees from March to September or pines during February to mid-October. Do not pile unseasoned, freshly cut wood near woody landscape plants. Freshly cut wood and trees that are dying or have recently died provide an abundant breeding source for some wood-boring beetles. Tightly seal firewood beneath thick (10 mil), clear plastic sheets in a sunny location for several months to exclude attacking beetles, and kill any beetles already infesting the wood. To be effective, solar/plastic treatment requires vigilance and careful execution. It is important to keep wood piles small, use high-quality clear plastic resistant to UV (ultraviolet light) degradation, and thoroughly seal edges and promptly patch holes to prevent beetles from escaping. For more information on cultural controls, see the publications by Donaldson and Seybold 1998\t(PDF) and Sanborn 1996. Biological Control When bark beetles attack trees, natural enemies are attracted to feeding and mating bark beetles. The two main groups of natural enemies are predators and parasites. Predators are more important in regulating bark beetle populations than parasites. Natural enemies are unlikely to save an infested tree, but they can reduce bark beetle population size, thereby reducing the number of nearby trees that are attacked and killed by bark beetles. The release of predators and/or parasites into sites infested with bark beetles has not been an effective tactic to suppress bark beetle populations. The following natural enemies attack the western pine beetle, but rarely control it: woodpeckers, several predaceous beetles such as the blackbellied clerid (Enoclerus lecontei) and a trogossitid beetle (Temnochila chlorodia), a predaceous fly (Medetera aldrichii), snakeflies, and parasitic wasps. Behavioral Control Bark beetles locate mates and attract or repel other individuals of the same species by emitting species-specific airborne chemicals called pheromones. Pheromones are naturally occurring chemicals that are widely used as baits to monitor bark beetles by attracting them to traps. These baits are especially important for detecting invasive species. Professional foresters have sometimes controlled or suppressed small local populations of bark beetles by using attractant pheromones in traps, and repellent pheromones and other behavioral chemicals to deter beetles from valuable trees. Some behavioral chemicals are being used experimentally on an area-wide basis to protect stands of forest trees. The interactions among host trees and beetles and their pheromones are complex and often poorly understood. Researchers are refining the reliability of pheromone-based management techniques. Behavioral chemicals are currently recommended for use only by specially trained professionals familiar with bark beetle management. Landscape professionals and home gardeners should consult with local California Cooperative Extension specialists if they are interested in this management option. Chemical Control Unless trees are monitored regularly so that bark beetle attack can be detected early, any chemical spray application made once the beetles have aggregated and penetrated the bark is likely to be too late and ineffective. Treatment must target the adults by spraying the bark so that beetles are killed when they land on trees and attempt to bore into the bark to lay eggs. Chemically treating trees that have been previously attacked will provide no benefit and could kill beneficial insects. Seriously infested trees, or trees that are dead or dying due to previous beetle attacks, cannot be saved with insecticide treatments and should be removed. Systemic insecticides, meaning those that are implanted or injected through the bark or applied to soil beneath trees, have not been shown to prevent attack or control populations of bark beetles. Although new systemic products are being investigated, they are not currently recommended for bark beetle control. Circumstances for Effective Use of Insecticides Highly valued, uninfested host trees may be protected by spraying their bark with a persistent, registered insecticide labeled as a preventive spray for bark beetles. Look for signs of recent infestation to help decide whether preventive spraying of nearby, lightly attacked or unattacked trees may be justified. Spraying a persistent insecticide on valuable, uninfested host trees near infested trees may be warranted to protect uninfested host trees from bark beetles. However, do not substitute preventive sprays for proper cultural care. The infestation status of a tree can be determined by inspecting the trunk or limbs for fresh pitch tubes or frass; peeling a small portion of the outer bark from the trunk or limbs and looking for signs of adult beetles or larvae; and inspecting the foliage for yellow or yellow-green needles or leaves. Frequently the infestation is diagnosed after the beetles have vacated the tree. For example, when reddish brown foliage is observed the tree is dead and the new generation of bark beetles has already emerged from the tree. Fading foliage throughout the tree crown indicates a dead tree and no insecticide treatment will be effective. Because each bark beetle species attacks only certain tree species, spray only healthy trees that are susceptible to the beetle species attacking nearby trees (for example, pine bark beetles do not attack oaks and oak bark beetles do not attack pines) (Table 1). Insecticide sprays are not recommended against shothole borer and cedar or cypress bark beetles. How to Apply Insecticides Insecticide products available to home users are not effective for bark beetle control. Most home gardeners also lack the high-pressure spray equipment and experience to effectively treat large trees. Protective spraying for bark beetles must be done by a licensed pesticide applicator. When hiring a professional applicator, discuss the specific pesticide to be used and effective timing of the application. Also see Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company . The applicator must use a product with bark beetles listed on the label, and mix and apply the formulation following label directions. Proper application involves thoroughly drenching the main trunk, exposed root collar near the base of the tree, and larger branches (for engraver beetles) with a pyrethroid, such as Astro or Dragnet, or any of the flowable (EC) formulations of the chemical carbaryl to prevent new bark beetle infestations. (Note: These products are not available to home users.) The material must be applied before the new adults penetrate the bark surface of the tree. Regardless of the insecticide used, the applicator should mix only what is needed and dispose of any excess insecticide by properly following label directions. When to Apply Insecticides Preventive treatments must be applied to the tree trunk or branches to kill adults before they penetrate the bark and lay eggs. Treatment following successful attacks and egg laying will not be effective. In most cases, the time to apply is in late winter to early spring in warm areas of the state and late spring in cooler and higher elevation areas. For most insecticide treatments associated with bark beetles listed on the insecticide label, generally only one application per year is necessary to provide season-long control. However, depending on local conditions, the life cycle of the beetle, and the insecticide used, in a few situations a second application may be needed several months later to protect individual trees. For example, in California a single spray applied for red turpentine beetle and engraver beetles around mid-February, before adults arrive on new trees, should provide enough control for the home gardener or arborist to implement cultural practices to improve the vigor and defense of pines. However, if strong spring rains or regular irrigation sprinkling of the stem remove the insecticidal barrier, a second application may be necessary. Red Turpentine Beetle This beetle is very common on Monterey pines planted in urban landscapes and highway corridors within about 100 miles of the California coast. It is also prevalent on most pines that grow in the Sierra Nevada, particularly on pines damaged by wildfire. Otherwise healthy pines often survive attacks by a few individuals of the red turpentine beetle. Prominent pitch tubes on the lower trunk of standing trees or stumps of recently cut trees nearly always indicate the beetle’s presence. A red turpentine beetle attack likely indicates that pines are stressed from an unfavorable growing environment, injuries, inappropriate cultural care, or that pines are declining from old age. Ensure that planted trees receive proper care and a good growing environment to enhance tree survival. Western Pine Beetle This native species attacks the trunk of ponderosa and Coulter pines and creates long winding galleries in the phloem. The trunk quickly becomes covered with small pitch tubes as the beetles can be attracted in large numbers (aggregate) in only a few days. Drought-stressed trees are highly susceptible to attacks by these bark beetles. Heavily attacked trees invariably die and should be removed as soon as attacks are observed. Unattacked trees that are particularly vulnerable, such as during drought or those adjacent to attacked trees, can be protected by watering, if possible, and by applying an insecticide to the outer bark surface before beetles have attacked the tree. Elm Bark Beetles Elm bark beetles are pests because they feed in the phloem of elms and spread the fungus that causes Dutch elm disease. The fungus kills the vascular system of elms, causing foliage to turn yellow and brown and then die. Be sure to distinguish diseased trees from those damaged by leaf-chewing caused by elm leaf beetles (Xanthogaleruca luteola). Chewed leaves turn brown, which, when viewed from a distance, resemble discolored leaves caused by Dutch elm disease. If planting elms, choose from among the many new elm cultivars that are resistant to both disease and leaf beetles, as discussed in Pest Notes: Elm Leaf Beetle .",

    "contentQuickTips": "Bark beetles are common pests of many trees, but some of the most damaging attacks occur on pines and other conifers. Trees already stressed by drought, disease, or mechanical damage are most likely to suffer. Insecticides won’t save heavily infested trees. Instead, promptly remove infested trees and protect healthy ones with proper care. Identifying bark beetles and their damage. Adults are small, dark, cylindrical insects about the size of a grain of rice; they can fly from tree to tree. Larvae are tiny grubs that feed beneath bark on trunks and branches. Infested trunks and branches have many tiny holes where beetles have bored in or emerged. Tree sap or dust from boring can exude from holes. If you peel back bark on infested trees, you may see galleries (tunnels) from adult and/or larval mining. Bark beetles in California include western pine beetles on ponderosa pine; mountain pine beetles on lodgepole and sugar pines; and engraver beetles on Monterey, pinyon, and other pines. Shothole borers and elm bark beetles attack some broadleaf trees. Bark beetles injure trees by disrupting the flow of nutrients. Adults and larvae feed in the area of the inner bark that transports nutrients through the tree. Needles turn yellow and drop off from infested trees. Infested trees can die in one season, causing limb drop and increased fire hazards. Keep trees healthy to reduce attacks. With low to moderate numbers of beetles, healthy trees defend themselves by releasing sap into holes before female adult beetles can lay eggs. Drought, disease, and injuries reduce a tree’s ability to combat invasions. When possible, properly irrigate drought-stressed trees. Thin groups of trees or stands to keep remaining trees vigorous. Dense stands favor beetle attack. Avoid compacting soil and injuring roots and trunks during activities such as construction. Remove severely infested trees. Regularly inspect your trees for signs of bark beetle invasions. Signs include dust from boring, small holes exuding sap, and tree crown decline. Promptly remove infested trees and destroy infested material by chipping or solarizing to prevent emerging beetles from attacking healthy trees. Solarize infested wood by tightly wrapping small piles in thick (10 mil) clear plastic and leaving them in the sun for several months. What about pesticides? Limit insecticide use (sprayed or systemic) to protecting healthy trees and combine with other nonchemical methods to improve tree defense. Insecticides are most effective when applied before adults land on the tree. Insecticides won’t save heavily infested trees because they have limited impact on bark beetles inside the tree. Effective insecticides for bark beetles are available only to licensed applicators. ",

    "damagePestNote": "The bugs do little damage to ornamental trees. They may occasionally cause puckering or distortion of fruit in commercial orchards such as pear or kiwi, but this is rarely a significant problem. They do not injure people or pets; but when they come indoors, they can be annoying and may spot curtains, furnishings, and clothing with their excrement. When crushed, they give off an offensive odor. They do not breed indoors. If trapped in basements or houses, they will eventually die.",
    "managementPestNote": "Boxelder bugs do not cause significant damage to landscape plants, and management need only be directed at keeping them out of homes, where they may become a nuisance. If boxelder bugs frequently invade homes, seal up entry points such as cracks and screen windows and doors. Sanitation practices such as vacuuming can be used to reduce population numbers, but vigilance may be required during fall migration. Outdoors, eliminate hiding places and debris and consider removing female box elder trees. Insecticide use is rarely justified. Elimination of Host Trees Since the box elder tree is the main source of food for the boxelder bug, removing the trees, especially the female or pod-bearing trees, is the most effective way of controlling the pest. Be careful not to plant or allow the establishment of new box elder trees in your yard. However, elimination of trees on your property won’t always completely resolve the problem. Winged adults can fly for distances of several blocks, so boxelder bugs may also migrate in from a neighbor’s tree. If removal of trees is not an option, clear fallen seeds from beneath and near trees. Use a broom or shop vacuum on hard surfaces such as patios and driveways. A shop vacuum will also remove most seeds from grassy areas. Exclusion and Sanitation Repair torn screens and close up places where the bugs can enter the house, such as cracks around doors and windows and attic or basement vents. Use caulk, weatherstripping, fine-mesh screen, steel wool, or expandable foam as appropriate. Boxelder bugs that enter the home may be controlled by hand-collecting or vacuuming. Repeat as needed. Eliminate hiding places such as piles of rocks, boards, leaves, and general debris close to houses. Boxelder bugs hide during the day or overwinter in these sites. Rake leaves and remove weeds and grass from a 6- to 10-feet wide strip around the foundation, particularly on the south and west sides of the house. Keep box elder tree seeds swept up. A weed and debris-free area tends to reduce the congregation of bugs near the foundation. Boxelder bugs are susceptible to drowning, so wash boxelder bugs off walls or tree trunks with a forceful stream of water. Chemical Control Insecticide sprays are generally not recommended for boxelder bug management. They are often no more effective than vacuuming and hosing, and repeated applications may be required. Insecticidal soap applied in a forceful spray of water may reduce populations on tree trunks. Pyrethroid insecticides are available for treating foundation walls around the perimeter of buildings. If required, these applications are best done by a professional. Special care must be taken to avoid runoff of pesticides from walls and foundations into storm drains, because they lead directly into creeks and rivers. Do not use sprays for boxelder bugs inside the house.",

    "name": "Bee and Wasp Stings",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7449.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Nearly everyone has been stung by an insect at one time or another. It’s an unpleasant experience that people hope not to repeat, but for most people the damage inflicted is only temporary pain. Only a very limited portion of the population—one to two people out of 1,000—is allergic or hypersensitive to bee or wasp stings. Although this publication is about stings from bees and wasps, the information pertains to stings from fire ants as well. Stinging insects are limited to the order Hymenoptera, which includes wasps, bees, and ants. The stinger is a modified egg-laying apparatus, so only females can sting. Most hymenopterans live solitary lives, and their behavior is more likely to be flight than fight. Social hymenopterans—including yellowjackets, honey bees, bumble bees, and fire ants—have individuals in the colony whose task it is to defend the nest. If the nest is disturbed, these individuals will defend it vigorously. In addition, foraging members of the colony also will sting if they are disturbed or injured as they go about their activities. Some, such as the yellowjacket, are much more likely to attack than others. For more information on the behavior, biology, and management of this insect, see Pest Notes: Yellowjackets and Other Social Wasps. The Africanized honey bee is closely related to the European honey bee, which is used in agriculture for crop pollination and honey production. The two types of bees look the same, and their behavior is similar in many respects. Neither is likely to sting when gathering nectar and pollen from flowers, but both will sting in defense if provoked. An individual Africanized bee can sting only once and has the same venom as the European honey bee. However, Africanized honey bees are less predictable and more defensive than European honey bees. They are more likely to defend a greater area around their nest, and they respond faster and in greater numbers than the European honey bee. SINGLE STINGS Stingers are effective weapons because they deliver a venom that causes pain when injected into the skin. The major chemical responsible for this is melittin; it stimulates the nerve endings of pain receptors in the skin. The result is a very uncomfortable sensation, which begins as a sharp pain that lasts a few minutes and then becomes a dull ache. Even up to a few days later, the tissue may still be sensitive to the touch. The body responds to stings by liberating fluid from the blood to flush venom components from the area. This causes redness and swelling at the sting site. If this isn’t the first time the person has been stung by that species of insect, it is likely that the immune system will recognize the venom and enhance the disposal procedure. This can lead to very large swelling around the sting site or in a whole portion of the body. The area is quite likely to itch. Oral and topical antihistamines should help prevent or reduce the itching and swelling. Try not to rub or scratch the sting site, because microbes from the surface of the skin could be introduced into the wound, resulting in an infection. When the sting is caused by a honey bee, the stinger usually remains in the skin when the insect leaves because the stinger is barbed. Remove the stinger as quickly as possible because venom continues to enter the skin from the stinger for 45 to 60 seconds following a sting. Much has been written about the proper way to remove a bee stinger, but new information indicates it doesn’t matter how you get it out as long as it is removed as soon as possible. Fingernails or the edge of a credit card are both effective tools. If a stinger is removed within 15 seconds of the sting, the severity of the sting is reduced. After the stinger is removed, wash the wound and treat it. Several over-the-counter products or simply a cold compress can be used to alleviate the pain of a sting. Aerosol or cream antihistamine preparations that contain a skin coolant also can help. If the sting is followed by severe symptoms or if it occurs on the neck or mouth, seek medical attention immediately, because swelling in these areas of the body can cause suffocation. Anaphylaxis A small percentage of the population is allergic to wasp or bee stings. If you suspect that you or a family member might be allergic or is developing an allergy, go to a physician or allergist for testing. Allergic reactions to bee or wasp stings can develop anywhere on the body and may include non-life-threatening reactions such as hives, swelling, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and headaches. Life-threatening reactions such as shock, dizziness, unconsciousness, difficulty breathing, and laryngeal blockage resulting from swelling in the throat require immediate medical care. Symptoms can begin immediately following the sting or up to 30 minutes later and may last for hours. In allergic persons, venom components circulating in the body combine with antibodies that are associated with mast cells resting on vital organs. The mast cells release histamine and other biologically active substances. This results in a leakage of fluid out of the blood and into the body tissues. Blood pressure drops dangerously low, and fluid builds up in the lungs. If this response isn’t reversed within a short time, the patient may die of anaphylactic shock. Anaphylaxis, if treated in time, usually can be reversed by the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) injected into the body. Individuals who are aware that they are allergic to stings should carry an epinephrine injection device whenever they think they may encounter stinging insects. Epinephrine is obtainable only by prescription from a physician. Antihistamines potentially have value in combating non-life-threatening reactions but should be used according to a physician’s instructions. Another method of combating anaphylaxis is desensitization. In this approach, the patient is subjected to injections of the venom to which he or she is allergic in increasing doses over a period of time. Like hay fever shots, the tactic is to build up a protective concentration of antibodies in the blood that will intercept and tie up the venom components before they can reach the antibodies on the mast cells. Desensitization with pure venom works about 95% of the time. MULTIPLE STINGS Mass Envenomation Occasionally a person becomes involved in a situation where he or she is stung many times before being able to flee from the nesting site. Depending on the number of stings, the person may just hurt a lot, feel a little sick, or feel very sick. Humans can be killed if stung enough times in a single incident. With honey bees the toxic dose (LD50) of the venom is estimated to be 8.6 stings per pound of body weight. Obviously, children are at a greater risk than adults. In fact, an otherwise healthy adult would have to be stung more than 1,000 times to be in risk of death. Most deaths caused by multiple stings have occurred in men in their 70s or 80s who were known to have poor cardiopulmonary functioning. Renal Insufficiency A second, potentially life-threatening result of multiple stings occurs days after the incident. Proteins in the venom act as enzymes; one dissolves the cement that holds body cells together, while another perforates the walls of cells. This damage liberates tiny tissue debris that normally would be eliminated through the kidneys. If too much debris accumulates too quickly, the kidneys become clogged and the patient is in danger of dying from kidney failure. It is important for persons who have received many stings at one time to discuss this secondary effect with their doctors. (Wasp stings are as potent in this respect as bee stings.) Patients should be monitored for a week or two following an incident involving multiple stings to be certain that no secondary health problems arise. AVOIDING STINGS Bees and wasps can be attracted to, or may react to, odors in the environment. It is best not to use perfume, cologne, or scented soaps if you are going into an area of bee and/or wasp activity. Unless someone accidentally collides quite hard with or swats at a bee or wasp, it is not likely to sting. Avoid going barefoot in vegetation, especially clover and blooming ground covers. Also avoid wearing brightly colored or patterned clothing. If you remain calm when a bee or wasp lands on your skin to inspect a smell or to get water if you are sweating heavily, the insect eventually will leave of its own accord. If you don’t want to wait for it to leave, gently and slowly brush it away with a piece of paper. When swimming in pools, watch out for bees or wasps trapped on the surface of the water. If you find bees or wasps in the water, it’s best to remove them to avoid being stung. Stinging incidents often occur when nesting areas of social insects are disturbed. Be observant of the area around you. If you see insects flying to and from a particular place, avoid it. If you are going to be in an area where disturbing a nest is likely, wear long pants and a long-sleeved shirt. It might be a good idea to carry a military surplus, collapsible mosquito/gnat veil with you. Stinging insects often fly around the top of their targets. Because stings in the face can be disorienting, put on the veil, or pull a portion of your shirt over your head, and run away. Be sure that you can see where you are going. Insect repellent applied to your skin or clothing won’t deter these stinging insects.",

    "damagePestNote": "Black scale can adversely affect plant vigor and productivity. The impact on productivity is perhaps most evident in olive trees where heavy scale infestations may reduce return bloom and the size of next year’s crop. Additionally, sooty mold colonization of honeydew deposits may reduce the plant’s photosynthetic activity by effectively shading leaf surfaces from the sun, resulting in some defoliation. Honeydew and sooty mold detract from the aesthetic value of landscape plants and render harvest of fruit an unpleasant activity due to the sticky nature of the honeydew. In commercial orchards, sooty mold infestation may result in downgraded fruit quality. The honeydew may also attract tephritid fruit flies (i.e., olive fruit fly) and vinegar flies (i.e., Drosophila species) as well as other insects such as wasps and ants that use the honeydew as a food source.",
    "managementPestNote": "Management of black scale in the home landscape may be approached with combined cultural, biological, and chemical control strategies. In many cases biological control is sufficient unless broad-spectrum sprays for other pests have killed natural enemies. Few home gardeners in most parts of California need to spray for black scale. Cultural Control Because the second- and third-instar nymphs are susceptible to desiccation (extreme dryness), pruning the plant canopy may eliminate cool microclimates that promote black scale survival. If possible, prune out infested branches of the plant to physically reduce black scale populations on site. Pruning is the best cultural control practice available both in commercial orchards and in home landscapes. Hand removal or crushing of scales on individual plants can also be an effective management tool in the landscape. Biological Control Efficacy of biological control for management of black scale may vary by region. In the southern San Joaquin Valley, biological control of black scale may be ineffective because the timing of the scale life cycle isn’t conducive to insect parasitoid reproduction and development. However, in Northern California and the state’s coastal areas, a number of parasitoids (tiny wasps, barely visible to the naked eye) may attack black scale, including Scutellista caerulea and Metaphycus helvolus, providing effective control in many landscapes. The presence of resident natural enemies in landscapes can be determined by observing mature female scales with a hand lens. Parasitized scales will have a small exit hole chewed by the adult parasite. To protect resident natural enemies, avoid using broad-spectrum persistent insecticides in landscapes. Biological control of soft scales can often be inhibited by the activities of ants, which protect them from natural enemies. If ants are active, manage them by circling trunks with a sticky material such as Tanglefoot placed on trunk wraps, and prune to prevent bridges between plants that may allow ants to move from the ground or infested plants to vegetation above the sticky barrier. Ant baits may also be effective. Chemical Control A narrow-range mineral oil, applied at high spray volumes (beyond the point of runoff), may be utilized to manage black scale. A recent study also suggests that canola oil (1% by volume) may be utilized as a nonpetroleum-based product to manage black scale on olive. Oil essentially suffocates the insect and is most effective at the crawler stage (early first instar); therefore, monitoring of the insect population is essential for successful control. Because black scale attacks a diverse range of host plants, it is important to consider the potential for oil applications to cause phytotoxicity (damage to plants). Before widespread use in a landscape, test for potential phytotoxicity by applying oil to a small group of plants or plant parts. If scale populations are high and there are few signs of parasitization, an oil application may be employed to manage black scale. In the San Joaquin Valley, a winter oil application may be effective when applied between November and late January—a timeframe when the rubber stage and adult insects aren’t generally present. In both the Sacramento Valley and the San Joaquin Valley, a summer oil application may be applied when crawlers have hatched, generally from mid-May through August. To properly time a summer oil application, double-sided sticky traps can be suspended in the tree canopy to monitor for presence of crawlers. Oil applications must be completed before the insect enters the rubber stage or adult stage; thereafter, applications aren’t effective.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Contrary to popular belief, there are no populations of the brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa, in California. In fact, fewer than 20 verified specimens have been collected in the state over several decades by spider experts. Yet people in California frequently relate stories in which they or someone they know was supposedly bitten or they have had a physician diagnose them with a brown recluse spider bite. Black widows on the other hand, are very common throughout the state, causing potentially serious injury with their bite. The adult females are easily identifiable by their shiny black body color and red hourglass on the belly. For information on black widows, see the Pest Notes: Widow Spiders and Their Relatives. Although the brown recluse does not live in California, four species of native recluse spiders occur in southern areas of the state and can cause similar medical concerns. The most common Californian recluse spider is the desert recluse, Loxosceles deserta . It is found mostly in the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, in the foothills of the lower San Joaquin Valley, and in adjacent areas of Mexico; most of these areas are sparsely populated by humans. This publication was written to provide science-based information about the status of the brown recluse and other related spiders in California. COMMON AND SCIENTIFIC NAMES Over the years, the group of spiders to which the brown recluse belongs has been known by various colloquial names: \"violin\" spiders, \"fiddleback\" spiders, \"recluse\" spiders, and \"brown\" spiders. The recluse spiders are in the family Sicariidae (formerly Loxoscelidae). The scientific name for the recluse spider genus is Loxosceles (lox-SOS-a-leez) and rhymes somewhat with \"isosceles\" as in the triangle. Whereas \"isosceles\" means equal legs, \"loxosceles\" means slanted legs, referring to the way the recluse spiders hold their legs at rest.

    "damagePestNote": "All Loxosceles spiders tested so far have the venom component that is capable of causing necrotic skin lesions, so it is best to assume that all recluse spiders may be capable of causing skin damage. In general, the desert recluse spider's venom is similar to that of the brown recluse and should be considered of equal potency. In comparison to the brown recluse spider, the Chilean recluse supposedly has more potent venom and the Mediterranean recluse's venom has been said to be less potent. However, these comparisons are more anecdotal than quantitive assessments. About 10% of brown recluse bites cause moderate or greater tissue damage and scarring, but the vast majority only result in inflammation and heal well without medical intervention. Deaths have been reported in children, however these are extremely rare occurrences and can be prevented if accurately diagnosed and the proper medical treatment applied. Medical Misdiagnoses The problem of misdiagnosis is widespread in North America, including such unlikely places as Alaska and Canada where doctors have attributed skin lesions to recluse bites when no brown recluse spiders have ever been found north of the 48 contiguous U.S. states. One reason for the great awareness of the recluse spiders throughout North America is that necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds are commonly misdiagnosed as \"brown recluse bites.\" Although recluses can cause these types of wounds, the biological data involving the distribution of the spider indicate that most of these diagnoses are incorrect. A world-renowned toxicology physician who worked at University of Southern California Medical Center estimates that most general spider bites in California referred to him were actually the work of other arthropods, and that 60% of \"brown recluse spider bite\" diagnoses came from areas where no Loxosceles spiders were known to exist. This is a serious problem, in that several medical conditions misdiagnosed as recluse bites can lead to debilitating and potentially fatal consequences. Additionally, many people diagnosed as having brown recluse bites in California are treated with antibiotics. Antibiotics work against bacteria and have no effect on spider venom. However, regardless of the causative agent, it is wise to seek medical attention if you feel that it is warranted. Because most brown recluse bites involve only inflammation, the recommended treatment is simple first aid: RICE therapy (Rest, Ice, Compression, Elevation) although other medical experts suggest cold instead of ice (to avoid freezing tissue) and a neutral position (lay flat) rather than elevated. Multiple Lesions Spiders typically bite only once as a desperate defensive effort before they are crushed between flesh and some object. Therefore, spider bites are not the causes of skin lesions if 1) there are multiple lesions on one person at the same time, especially if the lesions are on widely separated parts of the body, 2) if there are multiple episodes of lesions on the same person over a period of several weeks or months, or 3) if there are multiple people in the same house or facility showing skin lesions at the same time. Multiple lesions immediately point toward the more likely situation of a contagious bacterial infection like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) or possibly an infestation of an arthropod (fleas, mites, kissing bugs, bed bugs, etc.) that seeks out mammals for blood meals. Bacterial Infections Group A Streptococcus infection, also known as necrotizing fasciitis, is sometimes misdiagnosed as a brown recluse bite, and has a fatality rate that can vary from 20 to 80% depending on how quickly it is correctly diagnosed. In serious cases, death from Strepococcus A can occur in a few days. Another medical condition that is frequently misdiagnosed as a spider bite or brown recluse bite is MRSA bacterial infection. Infections of this pathogen, which began to emerge in the 1990s, are no worse than other Staph infections. However, because they are not remedied by common antibiotics, the infections continue out of control and can be fatal unless properly medicated. In one national study involving 11 university-based medical facilities, 29% of the patients presenting for \"spider bite\" had MRSA as the cause of their skin and soft tissue injury. MRSA is a contagious infection, frequently found in places where people are housed in close quarters for lengthy periods of time. Such conditions include prisons and other correctional facilities, nursing homes, long-term health care facilities, sports camps, military barracks, and locker rooms and typically involve several people being afflicted simultaneously. Very often \"spider bites\" are the first thing that people blame as the cause of these wounds. However, more careful investigation typically leads to identifying a MRSA bacterial infection as the causal agent.The problem clears up quickly when the bacterial infection is correctly diagnosed and treated. Necrotic Wound Causes If you do get a necrotic wound in California, you and your medical professional should consider many other common causes to be much more probable than a bite from a brown recluse spider. If an arthropod is involved at all, one should first consider all those creatures that seek out mammals for blood meals and may cause necrotic-type wounds. These include mites, fleas, bed bugs, mosquitoes, soft ticks, hard ticks, and blood-sucking conenose bugs (also known as kissing bugs) (see Pest Notes : Fleas, Bed Bugs, Mosquitoes, Conenose Bugs, and Lyme Disease in California listed in SUGGESTED READING). In addition, there is a long list of medical conditions and diseases that exhibit necrotic-type wounds. A few of these are Staphylococcus and Streptococcus bacterial infections, lymphomatoid papulosis (a non-Hodgkin's disease lymphoma), diabetic ulcer, pyoderma gangrenosum, infected herpes simplex, herpes zoster (\"shingles\"), chemical and thermal burns, poison ivy, poison oak, and Lyme disease. Any and all of these situations are more likely than the bite of a brown recluse spider in California.",
    "managementPestNote": "If you do not live in the shaded areas on the map, you do not need to be concerned with recluse spiders in California. If you do live within the range of these spiders, you still need to verify that you have recluses on your property before attempting control. Not all micro-habitats within the shaded areas will be suitable for recluse survival. For example, even though Loxosceles laeta occurs in densely populated sections of Los Angeles, this species is usually found only in dark commercial and municipal storage basements, not in homes. This leaves the desert recluse as the only California species of concern, and a minor one at that. After verifying that you do have desert recluses in your home, there are steps you can take to reduce encounters with them. These measures are similar for reducing encounters with spiders in general. Nonchemical control The most important precaution is to remove or reduce outdoor trash and rubbish, such as woodpiles, boxes, plywood, tires, and trash cans—especially if they are stored right next to the house. In residences with attached garages, block off house access to spiders by sealing cracks around doors and access holes for electrical conduits or plumbing. In the Midwest, some brown recluse bites occur when a sleeping person rolls over during the night, and the trapped spider bites in self defense. In the bedroom, move the bed away from the wall, remove any bed skirts or ruffles and remove all items stored under the bed. This minimizes the chance that any spider can crawl onto the bed and inflict a bite. Do not leave clothes and shoes on the floor, or shake them before dressing if they are left out. Apparel and equipment that is only occasionally used (gardening clothes and gloves, boots, baseball mitts, seasonal clothes and gear, etc.) should be stored in tightly closed plastic bags or bins, especially if stored in the garage or other dark storage areas. Sticky traps placed along floor boards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a non-insecticidal way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. See the short UC IPM YouTube video How to Catch a Spider. Chemical control Typically, pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy and much less toxic for your living area to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify. Freeze the spider first, soak it in rubbing alcohol for a few days to preserve it, then pour off the alcohol and rinse the spider with water to remove alcohol residue before shipping. When sending the spider in for identification, do not mail it in alcohol as this is a violation of postal regulations.",

    "damagePestNote": "Brown marmorated stink bugs primarily damage fruit and are a serious pest of many fruit and fruiting vegetable crops. In Asia, BMSB are reported to feed on over 100 host plants, including tree fruit, vegetables, shade trees, and leguminous crops. In the mid-Atlantic, the crops most affected are apple, pear, peach, nectarine, lima bean, snap pea, pepper, sweet corn, tomato, field corn, and soybean. Other identified crop hosts include raspberry, blueberry, grape, hazelnut, pecan, cucumber, and pole and bush bean. The stink bugs also feed on fruit or seed pods of ornamental tree and shrub species, especially tree-of-heaven (Ailanthus altissima), princess tree (Paulownia tomentosa), Catalpa (Catalpa spp.), English holly (Ilex aquifolium), Southern magnolia (Magnolia grandiflora), redbud (Cercis spp.), and Chinese pistache (Pistacia chinensis). The feeding effect on tree health, particularly young trees, is still being evaluated. A list of over 170 host species, including those that attract the highest densities, can be found at StopBMSB.org. The list of host plants will likely increase as the pest spreads to new regions. BMSB may reach very high numbers, and since one bug can feed on many fruit sources, losses can be severe. Adults and nymphs inject tissue-destroying enzymes and suck juices from fruit and seeds, creating pockmarks and distortions that make fruit and vegetables unmarketable. Damaged flesh under the skin turns hard and pithy. They can also feed on buds, flowering structures, leaves, and stems, including feeding through the bark of the branches and trunks of young trees. Nuisance Pest In many home landscape situations the greatest concern may be the movement of brown marmorated stink bugs into buildings as they congregate in late summer and early fall and seek safe overwintering sites. Once inside buildings they can become a nuisance and emit an offensive odor if disturbed or crushed. During the winter months, the adults do not reproduce and feeding, if any, is minimal. They seek out narrow spaces to hide indoors, including cracks under or behind baseboards, around window and door trim, and around exhaust fans or lights in ceilings; and they prefer high and cool locations. In the spring, adults move from overwintering sites to host plants. Brown marmorated stink bugs are not harmful to people, houses, or pets. They do not bite, sting, suck blood, or spread mammalian diseases; and they do not eat or bore into wood structures. Residents may become alarmed when the bugs enter their homes and noisily fly about when lights are on. However, the stink bug will not reproduce or cause damage inside structures.",
    "managementPestNote": "Interior and Exterior Control for Homes In the wild, brown marmorated stink bug adults spend the winter months in cracks or under the peeling bark of older or dead trees. This characteristic of seeking protection in narrow spaces has helped them to adapt well to homes and other buildings, where they seek shelter in late summer and fall. Non-Toxic Methods The best way to keep stink bugs from entering homes and other buildings is to exclude them. Locate openings where the insects can gain access, such as cracks around windows, doors, screens, utility pipes, window air conditioners, vents, siding, and underneath fascia boards. These entry points should be sealed with good quality silicone, silicone-latex caulk, or foam sealant. Damaged screens on doors and windows should be repaired or replaced. Install weather stripping around the edges of doorframes. Adjust or install tight-fitting sweeps or thresholds at the bottom of exterior doors. Fill gaps on the edges of window air conditioner units and cover with screen material if necessary. Prevent entry into attics by putting window screening inside gable vents. Stink bugs are naturally attracted to lights. They will often fly around light posts in large numbers at night; therefore, turn off unnecessary lights. When entering or exiting a home, avoid inviting the bugs in by keeping exterior lights on away from the entrance and keeping interior lights off near the entrance. Consider turning off or relocating exterior lights around open (screened) windows to prevent the very distracting noises when they fly around the lights. To trap stink bugs that have come indoors, the most effective and inexpensive method is to place a foil roasting pan filled with some water and a few drops of dish soap, point a light into the pan, and place it in a dark room. Bugs will be attracted to the light and will fall into the water and drown. Empty the pan and repeat as necessary. See this short video from researchers at Virginia Tech. An efficient way to collect stink bugs indoors is by sucking them up with a dry or wet vacuum. The bugs will cause the collection canister or bag and other parts of the vacuum to give off an unpleasant stink bug odor, so some people dedicate a vacuum cleaner to stink bug capture only. Alternatively, a nylon stocking can be stuffed inside the tube and securing the end over the outside of the vacuum tube with a rubber band; this way, bugs are collected in the stocking and not the vacuum cleaner bag. Individual stink bugs can be brushed off into a cut-off plastic bottle containing an inch of soapy water, where they will drown in a short period of time. If needed, the container can be fastened to a pole or broom handle to reach high locations. Stink bugs caught live also can be placed inside a plastic sealable bag and then into a freezer for 2 days to kill them. To conserve water, avoid flushing them down the toilet and avoid placing live stink bugs in the garbage so they do not become established around landfills. Outside the home, sweeping stink bugs into containers can be effective when the bugs are easy to access and have congregated in large numbers; wait until it is cool so they don’t fly. Spraying the bugs with a stream of water will dislodge them but they will likely return. Insecticides Although application of insecticides outside structures and around potential entry points may temporarily deter stink bugs from entering homes, the sprays break down rapidly, often within days. Sealing structures is a much more effective and environmentally sound strategy. Indoor sprays are not recommended as they are generally ineffective. Control in Gardens The amount of damage brown marmorated stink bugs may cause to garden plants has yet to be determined and may depend on each region’s climate and nearby host plants. In the mid-Atlantic, many backyard gardeners have lost all their susceptible crops to BMSB. Keep in mind that a small amount of damage is tolerable; a spot or pithy area in fruits or vegetables can be cut out and does not affect eating quality. For large populations, a variety of methods will likely be needed to manage this pest, which may include the use of row covers, hand picking, pheromone traps, trap crops, and natural enemies. Covering vegetables with a row cover material can prevent feeding by stink bugs. A row cover is a light, permeable material, usually made of polypropylene or polyester that is used for extending the harvest season past the first few frosts and preventing damage by a wide range of pests. However, row covers also prevent pollinators from reaching flowers, which may be a key time for preventing stink bug feeding. Large fruit trees are very difficult to cover, winds can tear the material and in hot climates heat can build up inside. Espalier-trained fruit trees can be easier to cover. Because stink bugs are large, they can be easily handpicked and crushed or brushed off plants into soapy water. However, they can be hidden inside dense foliage layers or fruit clusters, and they tend to hide or drop when startled. The use of a hand-held vacuum dedicated to catching stink bugs can be effective at reducing numbers if used regularly. Be sure to also destroy the egg masses found on the underside of leaves. Commercially available stink bug traps with aggregation pheromone lures can be useful for monitoring to determine if the bugs are present, when they emerge in spring and when populations are high. They can remove large numbers of stink bugs but probably have little value in preventing damage to crops. Several studies have shown that traps are sometimes ineffective in catching stink bugs, unless populations are high. A 2013 study in Maryland home gardens showed that single pheromone traps placed a meter from garden rows resulted in more stink bugs and damage on the plants near the traps. This may be due to a “spillover” effect in which some bugs simply gather around traps. It may be useful to move traps well away from gardens, but the best distance is not known; and many backyards are too small to accommodate much distance. Natural enemies have been documented feeding on various BMSB life stages, including assassin bugs, earwigs, and green lacewing larvae. In some situations, researchers have observed egg mortality as high as 50 to 60%. Birds may feed on adults and nymphs. Tiny parasitic wasps, reported to parasitize up to 80% of BMSB eggs in Asia, have been imported and are under study in quarantine facilities; but it is unknown, at this time, if they will be approved for release in the United States. Although native natural enemies may not be able to effectively control BMSB, they are important to preserve because they control other pests. Most garden insecticides are not very effective against stink bugs, especially adults. Even if some are killed, additional stinkbugs are likely to move in to reinfest the crops. Insecticides, including broad spectrum, persistent materials such as pyrethroids, lower toxicity products such as oils, and botanicals such as pyrethrin or azadiractin, may provide some suppression of young nymphs. Additional research is required to provide firm recommendations for BMSB management with insecticides.",

    "contentQuickTips": "The brown marmorated stink bug (BMSB), Halyomorpha halys, has been detected in California. Wherever BMSB takes up residence, it causes severe crop and garden losses and becomes a nuisance to people. The ability of BMSB to hitchhike in vehicles and planes has allowed it to spread rapidly to new areas. Since it was introduced to the United States from Asia in the 1990s, BMSB has become established in the mid-Atlantic states as well as in Portland, Ore., and Los Angeles. How to Identify BMSB EGGS: Laid in clusters of 20 to 30 on underside of leaves, barrel-shaped, white to pale green YOUNG NYMPHS: Abdomen orange with brown markings MATURE NYMPHS & ADULTS Similar Stink Bugs (also known as shield bugs) BMSB adults look similar to other brown stink bugs. Here are some tips for telling them apart. RED SHOULDERED STINK BUG: Edge of abdomen concealed; antennal bands, if present, are not white; less than 1/2 inch long ROUGH STINK BUG: Distinctive teeth jutting out from shoulder; no antenna bands; 2/3 inch long CONSPERSE STINK BUG: Legs dotted with dark spots – no antenna bands 1/2 inch long/p> Impact of BMSB on Crops and People CROP DAMAGE: BMSB may reach very high numbers, and since one bug can feed on many fruit, losses can be severe. Adults and nymphs suck juices from fruit and seeds, creating pockmarks and distortions that make fruit and vegetables unmarketable. Damaged flesh under the skin turns hard and pithy. BMSB damages fruits (e.g., apple, pear, citrus, stone fruits, and fig), berries, grapes, legumes, vegetables, and shade trees. BMSB damage to tomato (left), peach (center), and pear (right) NUISANCE TO PEOPLE: BMSB seeks winter shelter, and large numbers may congregate on outside walls or invade homes by entering through small openings. It is also a pest in home gardens. These insects stink when disturbed. How it Spreads BMSB travels long distances by hitching rides in vehicles or as stowaways when furniture or other articles are moved, often during winter months. As a result, most new infestations are found in urban areas. Report any Sightings If you find a stink bug that you suspect might be a BMSB, place it in a container and carefully note where and when you collected it. Take the sealed container to your county agricultural commissioner or local UC Cooperative Extension office.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Large numbers of bees swarming in a tree in your garden or around your home can be unnerving, especially if they establish a hive within your house. However, bee swarms and nests can be safely managed if you follow careful procedures and get proper help. WHAT IS A BEE SWARM? Swarming is the honey bee’s method of colony reproduction. The old queen and about half of the worker bees leave their former nest and seek a new home, usually in the spring but sometimes at other times of the year when local conditions permit. To start the process, certain worker bees, called “scouts,” begin to canvass the surrounding territory for a potential new nesting site even before the swarm leaves its original colony. A departing swarm consists of a large number of bees flying in a cloud that seems to drift along through the air. People not familiar with honey bees are generally frightened by such a mass, which can contain 5,000 to 20,000 bees, but unless a bee becomes tangled in someone’s hair, it isn’t likely to sting. The queen is in the group, but not leading it. Usually within 100 to 200 yards of the original hive, the bees alight on an object and form a cluster, which looks like a seething, fuzzy glob of insects. Sometimes bees fly from the cluster to collect water and food, but most workers leaving the cluster are scouts that search out potential new home sites for the swarm. When they return from a good site, they dance on the cluster to communicate the location of their find. A clustered swarm of many bees may appear frightening, but most spring swarm clusters of European honey bees—the common honey bees in central and Northern California—are extremely docile. It takes quite a bit of stimulation, such as being hit by sticks and stones or squirted with a hose, to induce defensive behavior. The same may not be true for Africanized honey bees or for any swarm of honey bees that has run out of food, as these aren’t nearly as predictable and can be very touchy, even as swarm clusters. Honey bees will nest in cavities having a volume of at least 4 gallons but prefer cavities around 9 gallons. Honey bees also prefer dark cavities with an easily defended entrance that is at least 9 feet from the ground. Hollowed-out trees are ideal sites. However, honey bees may nest in all sorts of cavities such as inside walls of houses; in or around chimneys; in outbuildings, fences, shrubs, water meters, utility boxes, barbecue grills, and soffits; or under decks. Within a few hours to a few days, the swarm’s scouts usually reach a consensus about the best available site. Then the swarm takes to the air one last time to move to the new home. Once in flight, the swarm is guided by scouts and arrives at the new site. It forms a cluster around the entrance with many bees fanning their wings and releasing a chemical signal to guide the others. Then the bees enter their new home, somewhat slowly. This is what most people notice when they see bees clustered on a section of a building. Inside, the low humming sound of the bees ventilating their nest often can be heard. If the bees don’t find a new nesting location, they may begin producing beeswax and forming combs at the spot where the cluster formed, such as a tree limb, the overhang of a house, or another unusual place. These “exposed comb” colonies may exist until fall (or year-round in warm-winter areas), but robbing bees, hungry birds, and inclement weather usually put an end to these colonies and their combs.",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damagePestNote": "While they may look frightening, bees that are swarming and carrying honey from their old hive are much less defensive or likely to sting than they would be if they were protecting brood (immature bees) at the old hive. They shouldn’t pose much danger if left undisturbed but will sting if provoked. For information about bee stings, see Pest Notes: Bee and Wasp Stings. Once bees become established, they will begin to build combs for rearing brood and storing food. Although colonies may do no structural harm to the building, occasionally they use water to soften Sheetrock and remove it in order to expand the nesting area. Residents then will notice an enlarging damp area on their wall. In a few cases, the bees actually open a hole through the Sheetrock so that foragers escape into the house, annoying or scaring occupants. Finally, if the colony is killed and not immediately removed, honey will ferment and leak through walls and ceilings, causing damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "The need for managing bee swarms or hives depends on the location and whether the bees are establishing a hive. Swarms moving on without establishing a hive aren’t a concern. However, bees establishing a colony in a home need to be removed. Swarm Clusters Swarm clusters—the correct term for swarms when they aren’t flying—are ephemeral by nature and therefore generally don’t need to be managed. Whenever the bees locate the proper new nesting site, the swarm will fly off to the new location. The bees usually leave a bit of beeswax at their clustering location, so appearances of additional swarms at that same place can be anticipated in the future. If the cluster needs to be removed, call a beekeeper. Experienced beekeepers often remove clusters simply by brushing or shaking the bees gently into a cardboard box and carrying them away. Ideally the box should have an entrance that enables the flying bees to join the already-captured group. Place the box in the shade until nightfall then seal and remove it after dark. The beekeeper should be prepared for defensive behavior by dressing in a bee suit, but dealing with a cluster is usually quite easy. It becomes more difficult, however, when the cluster is hard to reach, such as up in a tall tree, intermeshed with the branches of a shrub, or wedged into the corner of a building. Preventing Establishment of a Colony in Your Home Sometimes it’s difficult to determine whether a honey bee cluster on the side of a building is simply resting there or moving, one by one, through a hole into an inner portion of a building. If the cluster size is shrinking but hasn’t flown away, chances are they’re moving in. When the bees first arrive, they are short on food and have to build combs from wax they produce from the honey they are carrying. They must continue to go outside to forage for nectar for the colony to survive. At this point, they can be “locked in” their new home with screen, steel wool, or something else through which they can’t chew to escape. If sealed in, they will die in place over the next week or two. However, trapped bees will search around between the walls trying to find a new way out. Some of them are likely to find their way into the living quarters, especially by following beams of nighttime room lighting. Bees don’t fly in the dark, but they will fly to the windows the next morning and stay there most of the day while they die of dehydration. You can safely suck up these bees with a vacuum cleaner hose. Remember there may be live bees in the bag for a couple days after they’ve been vacuumed up. Removing Established Colonies from Your Home Extracting honey bees from buildings is considerably more difficult than collecting swarm clusters. When the colony is first established, only a few pounds of adult bees are present, but these bees rapidly build combs, collect honey, and begin to rear more bees. A well-established colony may have up to 100 pounds of honey, many pounds of adult and developing bees, and many beeswax combs. Removing such as nest is a challenge. The first step is to determine the exact location of the combs and size of the colony. Although honey bees can be killed in place inside buildings by using pesticides that are labeled for killing bees inside of structures, this removal option often leads to undesirable consequences. (Note: These chemicals are available only to licensed pest control operators.) If the adult bees fall into a large pile, they may hold their body moisture and rot in place, producing a very bad odor. Liquid from the decomposing mass frequently penetrates the structure, leading to costly replacements. If the colony is well established, there are further issues associated with killing the colony. Unattended brood can also rot and become very odorous. Unattended honey stores can absorb moisture and ferment, creating gas that causes the cappings holding honey in the cells to burst. Gravity will start moving the honey down attached surfaces until it encounters a horizontal impediment, such as a window frame, doorframe, firebreak, ceiling, or floor. Honey then seeps through the drywall, leading to large amounts of cleanup and expensive replacement. If pesticides were used to kill the bees, then the honey, wax and, dead bees are contaminated and must be handled as hazardous waste. A better procedure than applying insecticides, especially if you have a beekeeper who is willing to help, may be to eliminate the bees without killing them. First the beekeeper will need to locate the nest by tapping the wall and listening for the hum of the colony. Some beekeepers rely on stethoscopes to find the edges of the nest. Others drill extremely small holes in the wall and insert a fine wire to find the periphery of the nest. To take honey bees and their combs from the nesting spot requires opening a fairly large hole in some portion of the building. That is best done by a professional contractor so that the hole can be easily closed after the bees are removed. If the bees are to be saved, the beekeeper gently removes them and their combs. If the bees aren’t going to be saved, they can be removed from the void with a vacuum device such as a Shop-Vac. This process tends to stimulate the bees to release an alarm pheromone that smells like bananas and increases defensive behavior, so everyone nearby must be fully clothed in a bee suit. Many beekeepers have baffles and collection containers in their vacuum lines to try to protect and save the bees. If the homeowner has a lot of patience and knowledge, the bees can be “trapped” out of the building using a one-way wire screen device that forces bees that leave the building to relocate into a beehive placed adjacent to the original entrance. For more details see Removing Swarms and Established Colonies from Private Property\t(PDF). If you can’t find a beekeeper to help, call a pest control company with experience with bee removal. Be aware that pest control companies generally will kill the bees before removing them. Don’t try to remove the colony yourself unless you have experience and proper equipment. Preventing Future Invasions Following extraction of honey bee combs from any site, the odor of beeswax remains. Because honey bees have an extremely acute sense of smell, that odor will be noticeable from a long distance and highly attractive to any future honey bee scouts seeking new nesting sites, long after the previous bees have been removed. Therefore, after bees have been removed from a building, all holes large enough to insert a pencil, or larger, that lead to spacious cavities in the building must be sealed. Although honey bees can chew out of a building through caulking, they won’t chew in through it. Larger potential entrances can be covered with screen having six or more meshes per inch. Cavities can be filled with expandable foam to make large spaces unsuitable for nesting. The area requiring examination and servicing includes the entire side of the building around the previous entrance or both sides of the building, if the entrance were on a corner. If bees can find access to a void adjacent to the previous nesting site, they’ll move right in. During the extraction process, some bees are likely to escape. Also, some honey bee foragers spend the night away from the hive in the summer, so there is likely to be a cluster of bees forming around the entrance after the bees and combs have been removed. That small number of bees can be vacuumed up or eliminated with an aerosol spray labeled for use on wasps and bees outside the home. Be sure to read the label and follow the instructions exactly. Finding Professionals to Assist with Colony Extractions It is relatively easy to remove a swarm cluster but a lot of work to remove bees in a cavity. Beekeepers might be willing to collect swarms for free, but generally it isn’t worthwhile for them to remove established colonies without charge, and in some areas your only option will be to hire a structural pest control company. This is particularly true in areas colonized by Africanized honey bees, including all Southern California counties. Both contractors and some beekeepers list their services in the Yellow Pages section of the telephone book and on the Web. Key words include “beekeeper”, “beekeeping” and “bee removal.” Beekeepers available for swarm calls and extractions also tend to put their names on lists of bee clubs to which they belong. Those clubs usually have Web sites that list locations, such as the Sacramento Area Beekeepers Association. County agricultural commissioners also have records of beekeepers registered in their counties. Registered apiary locations are confidential, but the names of beekeepers who are experienced in working with the public are often released from county offices . When arranging a bee removal, be sure you have an understanding of what will be done. Will the bees simply be killed in place—not the best idea, but cheaper—or will the cavity be opened, cleaned out of bees and combs, filled with insulation, reclosed along with all possible entrances, and refinished? A definitive job includes all of these steps but can become expensive. When it can be done, it is best to have the contractor and beekeeper cooperate in opening the hole, removing the bees, and sealing the hole. Finding a contractor who also keeps bees would be the best choice of all. For more information, see Removing Swarms and Established Colonies from Private Property\t(PDF) .",

    "damagePestNote": "Bed bugs feed on humans, usually at night when they are resting. This insect feeds by piercing the skin with its elongated mouthpart, which consists of four stylets that normally fold under its body when at rest but fully extend during blood feeding. Two maxillary stylets form canals, a small salivary canal that carries saliva into the wound and a relatively large food canal through which body fluids from the host are taken in. A bed bug can take up to six times its weight in blood during one feeding event, which takes between 3 and 10 minutes. Usually people aren’t aware they have been bitten until afterward; bites occur while people sleep, and bed bugs are known to inject a natural anesthetic while feeding. However, saliva injected during the feeding can later produce allergic dermal reactions such as large itchy swellings on the skin. These may become irritated and infected when scratched. Swelling may not develop until a day or more after feeding, and some people show no symptoms at all. Bed bugs have never been shown to transmit human disease. Distinguishing bed bug bites from the bites of other arthropods such as mosquitoes, fleas, and spiders is difficult to impossible. People often confuse itching bed bug welts with mosquito bites. The only way you can really confirm bed bugs as the cause is to find the bugs or their signs in your bed or bedroom. Often people are bitten when traveling and may be unable to produce a specimen, making diagnosis even more difficult. In addition to direct injury to humans, bed bugs leave odors and unsightly fecal spots on bed sheets and around the insects’ hiding places. These spots are usually reddish brown or dark brown to black, sometimes yellowish, roughly round (although sometimes they appear as streaks), and can be very small.",
    "managementPestNote": "Confirmed bed bug infestations should be managed by trained professionals. Managing a bed bug infestation is a difficult task that requires removing or treating all infested material and follow-up monitoring to ensure the infestation has been eliminated. Management will require employing several nonchemical methods such as vacuuming, washing bedding at a high temperature, using steam or heat treatment, and sealing up hiding places. Insecticides may be required to eliminate serious infestations. Several active ingredients are federally registered for bed bugs for over-the-counter use, but few have been demonstrated as effective. Pest management professionals (PMPs) have access to a wide range of effective registered products; however, insecticide resistance among bed bug populations is increasingly common. The best approach is to combine chemical and nonchemical tactics with increased sanitation and habitat modification practices. Prevention and monitoring of bed bug infestations are paramount and should be ongoing. Monitoring and Detection The presence of raised wheals, blisters, rashes, or any other dermal symptom associated with arthropod bites should never be used for diagnosis, since several household pests are known to bite humans, and since reactions vary widely between individuals. You can confirm a bed bug infestation only by detecting the pests themselves or their signs, which include fecal spots, blood spots, egg cases, and shed skins (exuviae). Current research indicates 85% of bed bugs are found in or near the bed, so inspections for infestations should initially focus on the mattress, box spring, bed frame, and headboard. Lift the mattress and inspect all its seams and surfaces as well as those of the box spring. You may need to dismantle the bed. Keeping in mind bed bugs can utilize cracks and crevices as small as the width of a credit card, make sure to thoroughly inspect all potential harborage sites. Use a flashlight and a small mirror to aid in the inspection process. It can take a good deal of time, patience, and perseverance to detect low-level infestations. Remember, these nocturnal insects are small. Although you can see adults and aggregations of nymphs with the unaided eye, seeing the eggs requires a hand-magnifying lens. Make sure to look for dark spots of dried bed bug excrement, blood spots where engorged bugs were inadvertently crushed, or the insects’ light-colored shed skins. A foul, rotting, bloody meat, or acrid “buggy” smell might be present in heavily infested areas. The remaining 15% of infestations usually are in upholstered furniture other than beds; in bedroom cabinets; along baseboards; under wallpaper; and in carpets, wall hangings, and similar hiding spots. Bed bugs prefer fabric or wood surfaces to metal or plastic. When there are heavy infestations, keep in mind that adjoining rooms, filing areas, and clutter can be out-of-the-way shelters. Recent research has shown that canine detection utilizing dogs conditioned to the scent of bed bugs can be an effective tool for detecting bed bug infestations. Laboratory and simulated field studies have shown this method can be very accurate; under actual field conditions, however, canine detection accuracy has been highly variable. Therefore, third-party certification and ongoing training of any canine team should be verified before hire, and any canine detection alert should be confirmed with a detailed inspection by a trained PMP. Other recent research indicates monitors that attract or intercept bed bugs moving between a hiding place and a host can aid in bed bug detection, particularly when using several monitors near beds or suspect locations. Pest management professionals are already widely using these monitors. Although quite diverse in terms of size, appearance, and price, monitors generally fall within one of two categories: active monitors or passive monitors. All monitors have the benefit of ease of inspection as compared to potentially having to disassemble furniture and other household items to find bed bugs. Active monitors employ an attractant—usually heat, carbon dioxide, host odors (kairomones), pheromones, or a combination of these—to lure bed bugs out of their harborage areas and into a pitfall or sticky trap within the monitor. These devices have the potential, especially in the absence of a host, to detect bed bugs that would normally remain hidden. Airborne aggregation pheromones and other behavior-modifying chemicals might someday help detect low-density infestations. Passive monitors either exploit a bed bug’s affinity for dark crevices or rely on chance encounters with pitfalls or sticky traps. Interceptor monitors are a hybrid between active and passive (pitfall) monitors in that they rely on the presence of a host (a sleeping human) to attract hungry bugs and then trap the parasites on route to their meal. These small double-cupped monitors are easily installed under the legs of beds and other furniture items. Research has demonstrated that such interceptors trapped six times more bed bugs than were found from human visual searches alone. Prevention People may bring bed bugs into their homes in luggage or on clothes after visiting an infested dwelling or hotel. If you travel frequently, look for signs of bed bugs in your hotel room by checking behind headboards and under sheets and by inspecting mattress seams and tufts, especially if you have been bitten. If you suspect bed bugs are present, change rooms or hotels. Inspect your luggage before leaving, and as soon as you get home, wash and dry all your clothes at the hottest settings the fabric will permit. Frequent travelers may want to store luggage away from the bedroom, such as in the garage or a hall closet. You may also inadvertently bring bed bugs into your home on infested bedding or furniture. If you purchase second-hand furniture, especially beds or mattresses, thoroughly inspect the item before bringing it into your home. If you remove infested mattresses or furniture from your home, don’t leave them on the curb or porch. Take such items immediately to the dump or clearly mark them as infested by bed bugs so others won’t unknowingly bring the items into their homes. Managers of hotels, furnished apartments, dormitories, homeless shelters, and other facilities that house transient populations need to train staff to recognize signs of bed bug activity and take action as soon as they find an infestation. One proactive step a manager can take is to regularly replace beds, mattress, and bedding materials. Frequently laundering bedding and placing potentially infested items into walk-in freezers or heat units during tenant turnover can help prevent the spread and establishment of bed bugs. Keep clutter down, so it is easier to inspect and so bed bugs have fewer hiding places. Also, seal up cracks, crevices, and holes in bedding, furniture, and other potential hiding sites. It is much easier to manage a bed bug infestation when the population is small. Nonchemical Management A number of nonchemical control methods can be used to manage bed bugs. These methods are directed at killing or removing bugs or restricting their access to beds or bedding material. You can remove bed bugs and eggs with the suction wand of a strong vacuum; however, you must target the seams of mattresses and box springs, along perimeters of carpets, under baseboards, and in other areas where bed bugs live. A single vacuuming rarely gets all bugs and eggs and should, therefore, be repeated. Portable steam cleaners and other steam delivery devices can kill all bed bug life stages, so these items can also be used to clean mattresses and furniture. Care must be taken, however, to ensure steam penetrates into the areas harboring bed bugs and their eggs. Commercial heating services are available to treat entire rooms in homes for bed bug infestations. The current recommendation for effective commercial heating services calls for a temperature of at least 140°F for two hours or 130°F for three hours (the minimum lethal temperature is 113°F), which will kill most bed bugs and eggs. In California, providers of heat services must be licensed and bonded by the Structural Pest Control Board. Chilling to a temperature of 32°F or lower and maintaining this temperature for several days will also kill bed bugs. For suspected infestations in clothing or bedding, a home laundry drier at the hottest setting can be effectively used to deliver the necessary heat. At least 10 to 15 minutes exposure will be needed. Before using this method, consider whether heat will damage the fabric. Mattress encasements specifically designed to prevent bed bugs from establishing harborages on mattresses are commercially available and have been shown to be effective through laboratory research. Encasements are particularly useful for hotels or other facilities with many beds. Encasements can also be used to contain bed bugs within mattresses when they can’t be discarded or when control tactics such as steam or insecticide application are unavailable or undesirable. Bugs trapped inside encasements will eventually die due to starvation. Other management practices include sealing up hiding places where bed bugs can hide such as cracks and crevices in walls and around windows and doors. As a temporary measure, you can sometimes exclude bed bugs by using commercially available double-cupped monitors that are easily installed under bed legs. Insecticides Insecticide applications alone won’t control bed bug infestations. Insecticides must be combined with infestation prevention measures—a program of removing and cleaning infested beds, bedding, and other harborage sites—as well as nonchemical tactics such as steam or heat delivery and an ongoing evaluation and detection program to ensure treatment was effective and to manage future infestations early on. The most effective bed bug pesticides are available to commercial pesticide applicators only. Professionals also have the equipment and expertise that allow for a more effective and precise application of insecticides. In addition, professionals have the training to detect and isolate infestations, which often allows for more effective long-term management. Insecticides may be applied as liquids directly to cracks, crevices, bed frames, baseboards, and other similar sites, or they may be applied as dusts in cracks and crevices. Pesticides aren’t generally applied to mattresses or bedding because of potential risk to people. Using over-the-counter total-release aerosol foggers has been shown to be ineffective for bed bug control and potentially harmful to residents; therefore, they aren’t recommended. Liquid insecticide formulations, many of which are available for use only by PMPs, include:\tProducts containing the botanical insecticide pyrethrin, which gives quick knockdown but little long-term control\tVarious synthetic pyrethroid products (e.g., cyhalothrin, bifenthrin, deltamethrin, and permethrin)\tMixtures of pyrethroids and neonicotinoids (e.g., Temprid and Transport)\tVarious botanical oils\tNewer types of products including the pyrrole insecticide chlorfenapyr (Phantom) and the insect growth regulator (IGR) hydroprene (Gentrol)\tFumigation using the active ingredient sulfuryl fluoride is commercially available for bed bug control in California and can be highly effective. However, this is a highly specialized and regulated treatment method, best for remedial control only. Since fumigants have no residual effects, other methods or a combination of methods will be needed to prevent reinfestations. Some bed bug populations have developed resistance to pyrethroid insecticides and no longer can be effectively controlled by them. Therefore, there is growing interest in alternatives such as the mixtures, botanicals, and IGR listed above. Some studies, however, suggest that mixtures containing pyrethroids continue to drive resistance, that oils have little to no residual action, and that chlorfenapyr and hydroprene may take many days to kill bed bugs. Insecticides applied as dusts cling to the pest’s cuticle, wearing away the insect’s protective wax covering or poisoning the insect when it grooms itself. Several dust products used in bed bug management include borates, diatomaceous earth, silica gel, and formulations containing pyrethrin or pyrethroids. These materials can provide long-term control as part of an integrated program if they are placed in out-of-the-way places, such as under baseboards or in wall voids, that don’t get wet. Bed bugs may not groom themselves to the same degree as other pests, such as cockroaches, so insecticide dusts requiring consumption, including borates, may be less effective than anticipated. Do-It-Yourself Treatments Although over-the-counter pesticide products that have bed bug control written on the label can be found on store shelves, they aren’t generally recommended. Performance of these products under actual field conditions isn’t known. If you need to use a pesticide, you are better off hiring a licensed professional pesticide applicator with experience in treating bed bugs; see Pest Notes: Hiring A Pest Control Company. Residents do have an important role to play when their homes are infested with bed bugs. Once professional treatment has occurred, you should continue to monitor for bed bugs daily. Also, keep down clutter, and vacuum previously infested areas regularly.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Bed bugs are small, wingless insects that feed on blood from humans and other animals. These insects hide along seams of mattresses, within box springs, or within cracks and crevices in furniture, personal belongings, and areas near sleeping and resting sites. Eliminating an infestation is best done by a professional pest control company and may require removing or treating all infested material and monitoring to be sure bugs are gone. Bed bug identification and biology. Adults are small (about 1/5 inch), flattened, oval, and rusty red. Nymphs (immature stages) are smaller and lighter colored. Bed bugs feed only on blood and must have one blood meal prior to molting to the next stage. Adults may feed every 5 to 7 days but can survive many months without food. What are associated health problems? Bed bug feeding is usually painless; sleeping victims are typically unaware. Areas around bites might redden, swell, and itch several days later. Some people have no reaction. Bed bugs aren’t known to spread diseases but scratching bites can lead to infections. How does a bed bug infestation start? People can bring bed bugs into their homes on luggage, clothes, bedding, furniture, or other objects. Bed bugs can be picked up in hotels or other places during overnight visits. Hotels, homeless shelters, furnished apartments, and dormitories are most at risk of becoming infested. Second-hand mattresses and furniture are known to be high-risk sources of potential bed bug infestations. Detecting bed bugs. Using a flashlight and magnifying glass, look for bed bugs, their dark fecal spots, and light-brown shed skins. Inspect mattresses, box springs, bed frames, and other areas near sleeping and resting surfaces. Bed bugs like to hide. Remove bedding. Look in cracks and holes. Turn furniture upside down and take apart frames if necessary. Several kinds of bed bug detection traps are available to help determine if your home is infested. Use nonchemical methods to get rid of small numbers of bed bugs. Vacuum along mattress seams, baseboards, and other bed bug hiding areas. Wash all bedding and clothing in hot (120°F) water and dry them using the hottest setting. Specially designed mattress encasements are helpful in preventing infestations and sealing bed bugs within so they can’t bite. Serious infestations require professional help and may include insecticide treatments. If you rent your home, contact your landlord or property owner so that they can help you manage your infestation. Tenants have rights. Hire a reputable pest control company with experience managing bed bugs. They have access to the most effective monitoring techniques and management products. Insecticides alone won’t control bed bugs. Remove or heat-treat infested materials and limit hiding spots to prevent future infestations. Inspect after treatments to be sure bugs are gone. ",

It is particularly devastating to young seedlings and leafy mustard greens. Bagrada bugs often infest wild mustard weeds, which are pervasive in California on hillsides and in agricultural corridors in late winter to early spring.

The Bagrada bug is an invasive pest species, native to Africa, which has spread to India, Pakistan, parts of Southeast Asia, and Italy. In the United States, it was first found in Los Angeles County in 2008. By 2011, the pest had disseminated throughout Southern California to include San Diego, Imperial, Orange, Riverside, San Bernardino, and Ventura counties. In September 2012, the pest moved northward to Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties and recently (2013) the Bagrada bug was found in Fresno, Tulare, and Monterey counties.

    "damagePestNote": "Adults and nymphs of the Bagrada bug feed on leaves, stems, flowers, and seeds. They insert their needle-like mouthparts into plant tissues, inject digestive enzymes, and suck the juices. On leaves and stems, starburst-shaped lesions form. Leaves eventually have large stippled areas and may wilt and die. Ultimately damage may result in “scorched” leaves, stunting, blind terminals, and forked or multiple heads on cauliflower, broccoli, and cabbage. Bagrada bugs are particularly damaging to small plants and may kill seedlings.",
    "managementPestNote": "Early detection is important because Bagrada bug populations can build up quickly. Levels of infestation may be correlated with proximity to natural and cultivated areas infested with wild mustard or to neighboring vegetable farms. Landscape plants, native plants, and weeds may need to be monitored to prevent pest migration. Bagrada bugs may not be readily observed until damage has begun, so look carefully for fresh feeding damage (light green starburst lesions), which may be easier to spot than the insects themselves at early stages of infestation. Home gardeners and landscapers should carefully inspect their plants and shipping containers prior to planting. A good time to inspect is right after watering when pests hiding in the space between the potting mix and the sides of the container may be flushed out and more easily detected. When the bugs are common on plants, they may be monitored by beating or shaking plants over a tray or a sheet of paper. More frequent scouting may be necessary when temperatures rise above 75°F. Bagrada bugs tend to be most active and visible during the warmer parts of the day; therefore, monitoring should occur at those times. When temperatures are low or on cloudy days, these bugs may hide on the undersides of leaves, around stem bases, or in soil cracks and crevices. Cultural Control Remove weed hosts in and near planting areas. Bagrada bug adults, eggs, and nymphs in the soil or container media can be controlled by steam or chemical treatment before planting. Removal of plant residue after harvest can reduce carryover between crops. In gardens where the Bagrada bug is present in very high densities, it may be advisable to remove very attractive host plants such as sweet alyssum (Lobularia maritima) and replace them with plants not in the mustard family. Sweet alyssum can attract bugs into the garden and also serve as a source of infestation for other plants in the garden or landscape. Mechanical Control Picking the bugs off plants by hand is only feasible if pest populations are very low. When infestations are heavy, it may be possible to vacuum the bugs with a portable vacuum cleaner. It is often easier to tap the plant onto a sheet and collect/vacuum the bugs rather than removing them individually. Pyramid traps baited with crushed sweet alyssum, inside polypropylene bags, can also be used to catch and destroy bugs, particularly when numbers are high. These traps are available commercially as stink bug traps (e.g., Rescue Stink Bug Trap) but the chemical lures sold to attract other stink bug species will not work against the Bagrada bug. Growers that have access to greenhouses can protect cruciferous bedding plants and vegetable plugs by producing them inside. Using a double-door system in greenhouses can help to exclude the bugs and screened vents prevent entry of flying adults. As an alternative to greenhouses, screened tunnels or floating row cover fabric can provide plant protection in gardens. The mesh of the screening material must be fine enough to exclude the Bagrada bug nymphs and should be elevated so that it does not touch the plants because the bugs can feed through these coverings. The edges of protective covers must also be buried to prevent the bugs from crawling underneath to the plants, and they must be applied before Bagrada bugs get into the crop. Biological Control Although spiders and other general predators may feed on the Bagrada bug, it does not have specific natural enemies in the United States. Stink bugs are so named because they secrete a foul-smelling liquid that is repulsive to many predators. Birds apparently find the taste of these bugs unpleasant and may avoid eating them. Several parasitoids that attack eggs, nymphs, and adult Bagrada bugs are reported in the literature; but thus far, effective biological control organisms have not been available despite the prevalence of this pest in many countries. Unlike the harlequin bug, which it strongly resembles, the Bagrada bug often lays eggs in the soil, which would render egg parasitoids, such as wasps, ineffective. Moreover, although biological control options are currently being evaluated by some researchers, Bagrada bug densities can increase rapidly and biological control alone will probably not keep populations in check. Chemical Control There is little information on the effectiveness of pesticides that can be used against the Bagrada bug in home gardens. Generally, stink bugs are difficult to manage with insecticides; and repeat applications are often necessary. The adult bugs usually escape injury by flying away before they contact the insecticide only to return later. Home vegetable growers, especially those growing organic crops are likely to have better control using covers or screening to exclude bugs or by simply removing host plants from the garden. If insecticides are used, check the pesticide label to make sure the product is registered for use on home gardens and landscape plants. Research focused on managing the pest organically on commercially grown cole crops suggests that pyrethrum may suppress adults while azadirachtin and insecticidal soaps may reduce populations of nymphs.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Bagrada bug, Bagrada hilaris, is an invasive stink bug spreading through western Arizona and southern California since 2008, causing severe crop, nursery, and landscape losses. Bagrada bugs gather on plants in large groups. In agriculture, Bagrada bug is a pest of cole crops and other mustard family plants. In home gardens it feeds on these same vegetables and on ornamental plants such as sweet alyssum and candytuft. How to identify Bagrada bug EGGS: Laid singly or in small clusters on underside of leaves, stems, or on soil underneath plants. Eggs are initially white and turn orange-red as they get older. WINGLESS NYMPHS: Young Bagrada bugs change color from bright orange to red with dark markings as they get older. Newly molted nymphs and adults are also red but quickly darken. Similar stink bug Bagrada bug adults have the same coloring as harlequin bugs, but are smaller, about a quarter to a third the size, with smaller orange markings. Impact of Bagrada bug on plants Bagrada bugs use their needlelike mouthparts to pierce and feed on plants and their seeds. Depending on the kind of plant, plant age, and plant part they feed on, damage can include leaf spotting, wilting, stunting, central stem tip death causing multiple branches or crowns, and death of the whole plant. With high numbers of Bagrada bugs, young broccoli and cabbage plants left unprotected for as few as 2 to 3 days can be significantly damaged. Host range Bagrada bug prefers plants in the mustard family, such as sweet alyssum, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, collards, kale, radish, rutabaga, and weeds such as London rocket, shepherd’s-purse, and wild mustard. It reportedly also feeds on strawberries, melons, and members of the nightshade (potatoes, peppers), mallow (okra, cotton), legume, and grain families (wheat, corn, sudangrass, millet). How it spreads While bugs may move to other areas on their own, do not transport infested plants or produce into new areas. Report any sightings If you find a stink bug you suspect is Bagrada bug in a county where it hasn’t been reported, place it in a container, carefully note where and when you collected it, and take the sealed container to your county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension office. To learn where Bagrada bug is established and how to manage it, go to the UC IPM web site.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The sensation feels like bugs, worms, or mites that are biting, crawling over, or burrowing into, under, or out of your skin. They must be there, because you can feel them, and you are even pretty sure that you can see them. You may also believe that your home or furniture is infested, but you may be the only one who knows they are there. No one seems to think they exist except you. Nothing seems to get rid of them. So what are they—mites, lice, or worms? And what if your condition seems to be spreading to other family members or to your friends? What if, after trying every reasonable approach and helpful hint from friends, your problem persists? Then it’s time to read the rest of this publication and seek the proper type of professional help. The first person to contact should be your family physician or primary health care provider. Medical professionals are the only individuals who are licensed to diagnose your condition and recommend specific treatments. Dermatologists, in particular, are trained to deal most effectively with disorders of the skin and their causes, including parasites. If a parasite is causing the disorder, most physicians or their technicians can recognize the most common parasites. If necessary, the physician can submit medical specimens to entomologists, parasitologists, or other biologists for verification or identification. These narrowly focused experts not only can identify or rule out various kinds of parasites that may be causing your condition, they can provide additional biological information that may greatly assist your physician and you in arriving at a satisfactory diagnosis and treatment. Most entomologists are skilled in identifying various life stages of insects or mites and can use the correct references to determine what they are. Medical entomologists, in particular, spend their careers working with insects, mites, and ticks that attack people. Parasitologists study these and other groups of organisms such as parasitic worms, protozoans, and other invertebrates that live at the expense of their animal hosts. Initially, you may have tried to solve the problem by consulting nonmedical professionals. However, if you don’t seek professional medical advice, you may miss the opportunity to be properly diagnosed, especially if arthropods or other parasites aren’t the culprits. If you have consulted with any, or perhaps several, of the above mentioned professionals and still no one can pinpoint an offending organism, it’s very unlikely that all of them are wrong. It’s time to reassess your situation and look for a cause other than a pest organism. Itching, crawling, or burrowing sensations may be the result of many unrelated medical conditions, including: Stress; Reactions to use or abuse of prescription or illicit drugs, particularly methamphetamines; Allergic sensitivity to nonliving substances in your environment (e.g., office paper dust is a well-known example); Dry skin; Mechanical irritants, such as fiberglass filaments; Skin cancers; Vitamin, protein, or other deficiencies in your diet; Diabetes mellitus; Cerebrovascular disease; Hypothyroidism; or Delusory parasitosis. Thorough testing, including a complete physical checkup by a perceptive physician, should lead to an accurate diagnosis and treatment for most sensations of infestation caused by metabolic disorders or other medical problems listed above. If samples are required, they should be taken directly by the physician and submitted to the experts, if necessary. If a physical and/or thorough allergy and medical testing leave you with a clean bill of health but the symptoms still persist, you have to seriously consider the possibility you may be mistaken in your belief that you are infested with some sort of arthropod or other parasite. The medical disorder in which a patient has a mistaken belief of being infested by parasites such as mites, lice, fleas, spiders, worms, bacteria, or other organisms is called delusory parasitosis. This belief is based on the sensations felt in the skin that are very real to the sufferer. These sensations of irritation or itching or of crawling organisms are so real the victim is driven to believe that something has to be there. Usually, the patient scratches the itches, but they don’t go away. More scratching leads to rashes, open wounds and sores, and possible infections. Failure to obtain relief from over-the-counter or prescribed medications often drives the sufferer to apply unconventional and sometimes highly toxic compounds to the body in a desperate attempt to alleviate symptoms. Skin conditions can worsen or become much more complicated. In some cases the parasites appear to be visible to the afflicted person, but they can’t be caught. In a desperate attempt to discover the causative agent, some people will submit pieces of their own tissue to medical or other professionals in an attempt to produce samples of the pests. Such wounds can become serious medical problems. Very often a corollary problem associated with or causing delusory parasitosis is stress. Stress often manifests itself in people as a nervous habit or “nervous tic,” but those conditions usually aren’t overwhelming. Delusory parasitosis, however, can become debilitating because it tends to amplify the stress level; in turn, the condition worsens. Stress is known to be associated with many health problems in Americans. Stress may result from numerous experiences including job-related pressures, personal relationships, divorce, loneliness, financial problems, and loss of friends, relatives, or pets. Frequently, reducing or learning to deal with stress coincides with a rapid reduction or elimination of delusory parasitosis. Your doctor usually can assist in finding ways to reduce your level of stress. However, when delusory parasitosis is persistent, your physician may want to prescribe medicines that alleviate symptoms, at least temporarily, while more permanent solutions are sought. If your physician determines that further therapy or advice is needed, then you may be referred to a psychiatrist. Psychiatrists may prescribe compounds that can successfully treat this disorder. Delusory parasitosis is real, and with professional help it can be medically managed or eliminated altogether. More information on delusory parasitosis may be obtained from professionals working in county health services offices or University of California Cooperative Extension offices; from county agricultural commissioners; or from the Bohart Museum of Entomology, University of California, Davis Web site delusion.ucdavis.edu.",

The method involves heating the soil by covering it with clear plastic for four to six weeks during a hot period of the year and when the soil will receive the most direct sunlight. Plastic tarps allow the sun’s radiant energy to be trapped in soil, heating the top 12 to 18 inches to temperatures lethal to a wide range of soilborne pests; including weeds, plant pathogens, nematodes, and insects. When properly done, the top layers of soil will heat up to as high as 140°F, depending on the geographic location. Soil moisture is important in this process, as wet soil conducts heat better than dry soil. Moisture also makes soil pests, weakened by the heat, more vulnerable to attack by beneficial soil microorganisms during and after treatment. Solarization leaves no chemical residues and is a simple method appropriate for the home gardener and small- or large-scale farmers. Solarization is primarily used as a broad-spectrum pest control technique, but it may also improve soil health by increasing the availability of nitrogen and other nutrients to growing plants and by beneficially altering the soil microbiome. The effect of solarization is greatest at the surface of the soil and decreases at deeper soil depths. The maximum temperature of soil solarized in the field is usually from 108° to 140°F at a depth of 2 inches and from 90° to 99°F at 18 inches. Control of soil pests is usually best for organisms found in the upper 6 inches of earth.",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damagePestNote": "Solarization during the hot summer months can increase soil temperature to levels that kill many disease-causing organisms (pathogens), nematodes, and weed seeds and seedlings. Soil solarization also speeds up the breakdown of organic material in the soil, often resulting in the added benefit of releasing soluble nutrients such as nitrogen (from nitrate and ammonium), calcium, magnesium, potassium, and fulvic acid, making them more available to plants. Plants often grow faster, with higher and better-quality yields, when grown following soil solarization. This may be attributed to improved disease and weed control, increased availability of nutrients, and greater proportions of beneficial microorganisms. Effectiveness on Various Pests The degree to which various pests can be controlled is related to the intensity, depth, and duration of the elevated soil temperatures, as well as to the sensitivity to treatment of each pest species. Although some pests may be killed within a few days, 4 to 6 weeks of exposure to full sun during the summer is required to ensure control of many others. Fungi and Bacteria Solarization controls many important soilborne fungal and bacterial plant pathogens, including those that cause Verticillium wilt, Fusarium wilt, Phytophthora root rot, Southern blight, damping-off, crown gall disease, tomato canker, potato scab, and many others. A few heat-tolerant fungi and bacteria, such as those causing melon decline and charcoal rot of many crops, are more difficult to control with solarization. Nematodes Soil solarization can be used to reduce soil populations of many species of nematodes. This is particularly useful for organic and home gardeners. However, soil solarization is not always as effective against nematodes as it is against fungal disease and weeds. This is because nematodes are relatively mobile and can move deeper in the soil profile to escape the heat, rapidly returning to recolonize soil and plant roots following solarization treatment. Furthermore, control of nematodes by solarization will be greatest in the upper 12 inches of the soil. Nematodes living deeper in the soil may survive solarization, later causing damage in plants with deep root systems. Weeds Soil solarization controls many of the annual and perennial weeds present in California. While some weed species seeds or plant parts are very sensitive to solarization, others are moderately resistant and require optimum conditions for control; that is, good soil moisture, tight-fitting plastic tarps, and high solar radiation. Solarization generally does not control perennial weeds as well as annual weeds because perennials often have deeply buried underground vegetative structures such as roots, corms, tubers, and rhizomes that may resprout. Rhizomes of bermudagrass and johnsongrass may be controlled by solarization if they are close to the soil surface. Control of purple and yellow nutsedge, as well as field bindweed arising from rhizomes and some clovers, can be inconsistent, even under favorable conditions. For more information about common weeds and their management, see the Pest Notes: Weed Management in Landscapes . Beneficial Soil Organisms Although many soil pests are killed by solarization, many beneficial soil organisms are able to either survive solarization or recolonize the soil very quickly afterwards. Important among these beneficials are mycorrhizal fungi, and fungi and bacteria that parasitize plant pathogens and aid plant growth. The increased populations of these beneficials can make solarized soils more resistant to pathogens than nonsolarized soil. Although detailed information is lacking, earthworms are generally thought to burrow deeper into soil to escape the heat. See Soil Solarization: A Nonpesticidal Method for Controlling, Diseases, Nematodes, and Weeds\t(PDF) in References for more information about solarization and the specific pests controlled. Biosolarization For more experienced solarization practitioners, research and field practice has shown that it may be possible to increase the pesticidal effects of solarization treatments by incorporating organic materials, such as crop residues and composts, into the soil prior to solarization. This experimental treatment is often termed “biosolarization.” During the decomposition of organic materials, chemical changes occur, releasing certain natural products, such as organic acids, that are toxic to organisms residing in the soil. However, caution should be exercised to not incorporate excessive amounts of organic materials during biosolarization, as treated soil may be temporarily “soured” for an extended period of time by these natural toxins. In such cases, planting must be delayed until soil conditions are suitable. Alternately, treated soil may be detoxified via irrigation, leaching organic acids and other toxins below the root zone. Research to determine effective materials and protocols for biosolarization is ongoing. METHOD WHERE Soil solarization is most effective in warm, sunny locations such as the Central Valley, desert valleys, and other inland areas of California. It has also been used successfully in the cooler coastal areas of California during periods of high temperature and no fog. Soil treatment by anaerobic soil disinfestation (ASD) may be done where soil heating is insufficient for solarization. WHEN Highest soil temperatures occur when days are long, air temperatures are high, skies are clear, and wind is minimal. The soil heating effect is not as great on cloudy days. Wind will disperse the trapped heat and may loosen or damage the plastic sheets. Shady areas may not be effectively treated by solarization. Solarization is most effective when done during the hottest weeks of the year. The best time for solarization of soil in inland California is from June to August, although good results may be obtained starting as early as late May or as late as early September in the southern California desert regions. July is the most reliable time to solarize, except for coastal areas, where persistent, warm, fog-free periods may not occur until August or September. Soil within most regions of California, except high elevation areas and some coastal valleys, can be reliably solarized if treatment is instituted during the period of late June through August. HOW 1. Soil Preparation A very smooth bed, with few clods and surface litter, will allow the plastic to lie snugly against the soil, producing fewer air pockets. Air pockets between the plastic and the soil can greatly reduce soil heating and promote “sailing” of the plastic in the wind. Solarization can be done on flat areas or raised beds. Flat areas are easiest to solarize (prior to lawn reseeding, for example) and ensure more uniform solarization of the entire area. Raised beds are best formed prior to solarization so that tarps can be placed over preformed beds. This practice also minimizes disturbance of the soil after solarization, which may bring up viable weed seeds from deeper in the soil profile. If possible, lay raised beds out going north to south rather than from east to west to improve the uniformity of heating. The best solarization will occur on areas where there is little or no slope or where the slope has a south or southwest exposure. Solarizing areas on north-facing slopes is not as effective and may result in reduced pest control. 2. Irrigate the Soil For best results, wet the soil to at least 12 inches deep. In larger areas, it is easiest to do this prior to laying the plastic, but in smaller areas it can be done after the plastic is applied using a garden or soaker hose or by laying drip tape under the tarp. If wetting soil beforehand, place plastic covers over the site as soon as possible after the water has been applied to reduce evaporation. Unless the soil gets dry during the course of soil solarization, or you are aiming to do an ASD treatment, do not irrigate again, as this will lower the soil temperature and lengthen the time required for successful solarization. 3. Plastic Tarp Choice Plastic material. In general, transparent or clear plastic is most effective for solarization, as the heating rays from the sun will pass through the sheet and be trapped to heat the soil below. Usually black plastic is less effective because it absorbs and deflects part of the heat, rather than trapping as clear plastic does. However, in cooler or coastal areas, black plastic is sometimes better than clear, because weeds won’t grow beneath it, as they will under clear plastic when the air temperatures are too low to kill them. In this case, the black plastic should be left in place for several weeks during the hottest part of the year. Several thicknesses of plastic tarp are available. (Note: 1 mil = 0.001 inch or 0.025 mm)\tThin plastic provides greater heating, but is also more susceptible to tearing from wind or animals walking on it (1 mil).\tSlightly thicker plastic is better in windy areas (1.5 to 2 mils).\tThicker plastic can be used if the treated area is small (4 mil or more).\tPlastics designed for large-scale solarization are usually treated with an ultraviolet (UV) inhibitor so they will not break down as quickly in sunlight. For use in gardens, the rolls of 1 to 4 mil \"painter's\" plastic are available at larger hardware stores and are easier to obtain. These should last for the 4 to 6 week solarization period without beginning to break down. When available, select clear, transparent film, rather than cloudy, milky, or translucent materials which will reduce solar energy transmission. Plastic sheets without UV protection should be watched closely, so they can be removed before deteriorating to the point where removal and disposal are difficult. If a longer solarization period is desired, small areas can be covered again with fresh plastic. Any holes or tears should be patched with durable patching tape. For treating small areas in a garden, or on a lawn in cooler climates, it may be helpful to use a double layer of plastic with air space created by objects such as plastic bottles or PVC pipe between the layers. This has been shown to raise soil temperatures an additional 2° to 10°F over temperatures obtained with a single layer of clear plastic. 4. Plastic Tarp Placement Flat beds. The plastic must be held as tightly as possible against the soil. One way to hold it down is to dig a trench 4 to 6 inches deep around the area that is going to be solarized. Lay the plastic out over the area with one edge in the trench. Cover that edge with soil to hold it down. Pull the plastic tight from the other side and bury that edge in the corresponding trench. Do the same with the other sides and then walk around the perimeter of the trenched area to pack the soil down around the edges of the plastic. The closer to the soil surface the plastic is, the better the heating. Raised (formed) beds . As with flat beds, the plastic must be held close to the soil. Multiple beds can be covered by a single sheet of plastic, but heating may be reduced and the plastic may “sail” when it is windy. If only single beds are covered, the furrows between the beds are left uncovered and are not solarized. Each bed is covered with a strip of plastic tarp that is wide enough to cover the entire bed width and have enough tarp left over to bury the edges to hold it down. Avoid moving soil from the untreated furrows to the beds because this may re-infest the treated beds with pests. 5. Solarizing Period Solarization is both time- and temperature-dependent. The cooler the soil temperatures, the longer the plastic needs to remain in place to raise the temperature to desired levels. The goal is to maintain daily maximum temperatures in the top 6 inches of soil at or above 110º to 125°F. Use of a soil thermometer or temperature probe can verify achievement of these temperatures. Four to six weeks of soil heating during the warmest time of the year is usually sufficient to control most soil pests. In cool, windy, or cloudy locations, or if there are pests present that are difficult to control, it may be necessary to leave plastic in place up to 8 weeks. Conversely, during very hot weather, pests may be controlled with a shorter period of solarization. For instance, most soilborne pests will be controlled after only 4 weeks of solarization during June through September in California’s Central Valley and desert regions. 6. Post-solarization Removal of Plastic. After solarization, the plastic may be removed, taking care not to disturb the underlying soil to avoid bringing up viable weed seeds from untreated edges and furrows or from deep layers that did not reach lethal temperatures. The area can be planted immediatly with seeds or transplants for a fall or winter crop or a lawn. Alternatively, the plastic may be left on the soil as a mulch by cutting holes and transplanting plants through the plastic. Clear plastic may be painted white or silver to cool the soil and repel insect pests. However, the plastic tarp may degrade and fall apart during the growing season. If the soil will be cultivated prior to planting, the cultivation should be shallow (less than 2 inches deep) to avoid bringing viable weed seeds and pathogens to the surface. SOLARIZING SOIL IN CONTAINERS Soil solarization has been shown to be effective for disinfesting small amounts of moist, containerized soil and soil in cold frames. Soil can be solarized either in bags, pots, plastic buckets, or flats. These containers are placed on an elevated surface such as wooden pallets and covered with a double tent of transparent plastic. Soil temperatures should be monitored closely in this planting medium to assure that temperatures are high enough to control pests. As an example, in warmer areas of California, soil inside black plastic bags can reach more than 160°F during solarization. This is equal to target temperatures suggested for commercial soil disinfestation using aerated steam. At these temperatures, all soil pests can be killed within 1 hour. The double layer of plastic can increase soil temperatures by up to 50°F, and placing containers on pallets allows for heating from all sides of the soil mass. Alternatively, moist soil in pots, or as a mass, may be placed in closed black trash bags and placed on pallets. Soil temperatures can be monitored using simple soil thermometers inserted into the center of the soil mass, or by using thermocouples and a digital reading logger.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Many families with young children have at least one encounter with the head louse, Pediculus humanus capitis. Head lice can infest people of all ages, but children are prone to infestations because of their habit of playing in close contact, sharing hats, headphones, combs and brushes, sleeping bags, stuffed animals, and clothing. In fact, the problem of head lice can be so rampant among preschool and school-aged children that often schools must work in conjunction with many families to control an infestation. An individual family may be able to control head lice at home, but the child can be reinfested when he/she comes in contact with an untreated, infested child. WHAT TO LOOK FOR The most common symptom of infestation is intense itching on the back of the head or neck. The itching occurs when the lice bite and suck blood from the scalp. Immediately examine children who repeatedly scratch their heads. Because lice can be hard to spot, examine individual hair shafts, especially at the nape of the neck and behind the ears.

    "managementPestNote": "Head lice are not known to transmit any infectious diseases from person to person. They are more of a nuisance than a health risk problem. It is very important that the methods used to control a head louse infestation not cause more of a problem than the head lice themselves. One major problem for a child with head lice is that they will not be allowed to attend school as long as nits can be found in their hair. Nits are most effectively removed by combing the hair with a specially designed nit comb. Consider shampoo treatments only when active lice or viable eggs are observed. Although lice and their eggs may be seen without magnification, the viability of eggs cannot be judged without proper magnification and some knowledge of what hatched and unhatched eggs look like. See color photos of nits in various stages of development. There are four critical steps to controlling an infestation of head lice:\tthe use of an effective head louse treatment;\tnit removal from the head (combing);\tremoval of lice and nits from the household environment by vacuuming, washing, or freezing objects suspected being infested; and\tdaily head checks and nit removal until infestation is gone, followed by weekly head checks to detect reinfestation.\tHead Lice Insecticidal Shampoos Head lice shampoos contain insecticides and if they are not used properly can cause problems in and of themselves. In addition, resistance to the insecticides in the shampoos among populations of head lice is becoming an increasing problem. Most of the over-the-counter products contain either pyrethrin or permethrin (NIX and Rid). In the past a popular product for the control of head lice was a product called Kwell, which contains the insecticide lindane. Lindane has been associated with a variety of adverse reactions suffered both by people being treated and by people applying the treatment. It is also a troublesome pollutant of wastewater and requires special treatment to be removed. While lindane is still available by prescription, pyrethrin and permethrin are safer, more effective, and less polluting than lindane. When using a head louse shampoo, minimize body exposure by confining the insecticide to the head hair. Do not use it in the bath or shower, but wash the infested person's hair in a basin or sink so insecticide residues do not reach other parts of the body. The person doing the treatment should wear rubber gloves. Never apply an insecticide to anyone who has open cuts, scratches, or inflammations, and never use these materials on infants without consulting a doctor. In all cases, follow label directions completely and carefully. While pyrethrin and permethrin are fairly effective, they do not kill all the eggs. In addition, they may not kill all the nymphs and adults, especially if the population is developing resistance to the insecticide. Lice should die within 10 to 30 minutes after treatment with pyrethrin or permethrin. If you find live lice after 30 minutes, suspect that resistance is occurring and discontinue use of that product. If you need a follow-up treatment at the recommended interval on the product label, use a pyrethrin if you used permethrin the first time, or vice versa, but do not resort to dangerous practices such as applying other insecticides, pet flea and tick shampoo, or materials such as kerosene. You will still need to supplement shampoo treatment with combing the hair (as described below) and some cleaning of the house and personal effects likely to be infested. If you do not remove nits with hair combing, the infestation will reoccur and the additional use of the treatment products will increase the treated person's exposure to these insecticides, as well as help select for resistance in the head louse population.\tIf you want to avoid insecticides entirely, you could try using soap shampoos that contain coconut or olive oils. Most soaps kill all stages of the louse except the egg. Four shampoos, each about 3 days apart, should kill most of the lice as each successive shampoo kills newly hatched nymphs. Always combine shampooing with daily combing and a cleaning of the environment. Enzymatic treatments, including shampoos that claim to dissolve eggs, the cement that attaches eggs to the hair, or the exoskeleton of the adults, are also available to use against head lice. Although these materials are very appealing because of their relative nontoxicity, in university-conducted research trials none of them has yet proven to work as advertised. While shampoos with coconut oil may help in controlling infestations of head lice, they are not effective as a repellent against lice to prevent infestation or reinfestation. Hair Combing Combing the hair to remove nits and lice that survived the shampoo treatment is the key to successfully controlling this pest. This process is time consuming but critical for success. If you do not completely remove all nits, reinfestation will most likely occur. This process should be repeated daily as long as nits and lice are still found on the head. Many people use nit combs to remove nits from the hair shaft. The most effective nit comb is a metal one specially designed for removing head lice and their eggs; plastic combs, even the ones that come with the lice shampoos, are not as effective. Metal lice combs can be found at drug stores or ordered from the National Pediculosis Association, Inc., listed in \" References,\" which has a specially designed nit comb called the LiceMeister. The infested hair can also be cut out with small safety scissors. The person to be treated should be seated near a good light source. The materials you will need for hair combing are:\ta box of tissues and plastic bag;\ta good nit comb or a pair of safety scissors;\ta lamp that allows you to direct it to the area you are working on;\thair clips to pin up the sections of hair that have been combed; and\tsomething to entertain the person being treatedespecially if it is a child.\tFollowing the use of a head louse shampoo, use regular shampoo and conditioner to wash the hair (the hotter the water the better because lice are very vulnerable to high temperatures, but be careful not to hurt young children whose scalps are more sensitive to hot water than scalps of older people). Leave the conditioner in and towel dry the hair. Then comb the hair using a regular comb to remove snarls and the accumulation of any suds.\tStarting at the crown of the head, separate out a section of hair that is about 1 inch by 1/2 inch; hold it out from the head. Insert the louse comb at the base of the hair section as close as possible to the scalp, and pull the comb slowly through the hair. Be sure to slant the comb so that the curved side of the teeth is towards the head. If you aren't using a comb, go through each small section of hair and use your fingernails to pull the eggs off the hair, or cut the individual hairs off. Use the tissues to clean any lice or debris from the comb following each combing or to collect nits and hair that are removed, and put the tissue in the plastic bag. Continue to comb the section of hair until you feel sure it is free of nits or lice, then pin it out of the way with a hair clip and start on the next section of hair. If the hair dries during the combing process, wet it again with water to reduce pulling and hair loss. When all the hair has been combed, rinse it thoroughly with water and then dry. After the hair is completely dry, check the entire head for stray nits and remove them individually. To clean up, soak the comb in hot soapy ammonia water for 15 minutes or boil it for 15 minutes (only the metal ones). An old toothbrush is useful in removing the debris that is lodged in the teeth of the comb, as is dental floss. The plastic bag should be sealed and disposed of. It is not necessary to cut a person's hair if they become infested with lice. However, the shorter the hair, the easier it is to comb for lice. If successive treatments for lice have been made and the infestation persists, or if you want to control the infestation quickly, this is an option to consider. Cleaning Your Home It is important to wash the clothing and bedding of the infested person at the time he or she is initially treated. Head lice will be killed if infested articles are washed in hot water (at least 140°F) and dried in a hot dryer. If an article can't be washed, have it dry cleaned. Another alternative that works well for headgear such as earphones and bike helmets is to place them in a plastic bag and put them in a freezer. If the freezer is 5°F or lower, all lice and eggs should be dead within 10 hours. Also clean other personal items such as stuffed animals, car seatsany object that might have come in contact with the infested person's head. Vacuuming carpets and upholstery will effectively remove hair containing nits in these areas. While it is important to clean objects that come in contact with the head, in general lice stay on the head. Therefore it is not necessary to go into a frenzy of house cleaning and it is especially not necessary to use any insecticide to spray rooms or objects. Time and effort are much better spent combing nits and lice from the hair. Contacting Friends and the School It is important to contact anyone your child has had close contact with in the recent past to let them know of a head louse infestation. The reason for this is simple: the infestation came from somewhere, and if the source or other recently infested people are not treated, your child can become reinfested when contact is renewed. That means you will need to go through all of the above treatment procedures again. Nits are laid at the junction of the scalp and hair shaft, and they hatch in 7 to 11 days. The average growth rate of human hair in children is 0.4 mm per day, so by the time the nit has hatched it has moved about 2 to 3 mm away from the scalp. Therefore, nits further than 1/4 inch from the scalp have probably hatched and are no longer viable. For this reason, the \"no nit\" policy in place at many schools does not have a biological basis, but most schools do not have personnel with expertise in distinguishing the viability of nits. If head louse infestations are occurring at your child's school, check your child's head nightly using a metal lice comb and a good light source. The earlier an infestation is discovered, the easier it will be to treat. Avoid unnecessary treatments with head louse insecticides; use them only when lice or louse eggs have been found on a child's head to minimize the child's exposure to these materials. Also, the use of pesticide products can be harsh on a child's hair and very drying to the scalp, which in turn can cause an increase in dried scalp flakes and dandruff that might be mistaken for nits. Remember, nits are glued to the hair shaft and are not easily removed; they are oval-shaped and glued at an angle to the side of the hair. If in doubt, use a good magnifying lens to verify a suspected nit or louse (and compare what you find to these photos because pesticide treatment is not appropriate for hair debris.\tHEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES from California Department of Pesticide Regulation",

    "contentQuickTips": "Anyone can get h ead lice, but children are more prone to infestations because they play closely with one another. Head lice are usually spread through direct head-to-head contact and more rarely from contact with infested hats or combs. Head lice are not known to transmit any infectious diseases, but infestations can cause discomfort, anxiety, and embarrassment. Control lice by using a combination of treatment with an effective insecticide (to kill live lice) and combing to remove eggs (nits). Head lice facts Head lice cannot hop, fly, or jump; they crawl. They can only survive off a human head for about 1 or 2 days. Head lice cannot live on family pets. Nits more than 1/4 inch from the scalp are probably dead or have already hatched. What should I look for? Eggs glued to the hair near the scalp. Developing eggs are dark in color, but white after hatching Adult head lice are about the size of a sesame seed and crawl rapidly. Some infestations may cause intense scratching on the back of the head or neck, although not everyone has this symptom. How do I manage a head lice infestation? Remove eggs (nits) by combing hair with a specially designed metal comb. This is key to successful control, regardless of the any insecticide treatment used. Comb wet, conditioned hair. Repeat daily as long as you find live lice or eggs within 1/4 inch of the scalp Remove lice and eggs from any infested areas. Wash clothing and bedding in hot water and dry in a hot dryer. Freeze items like headphones, hats, and bike helmets in plastic bags for at least 10 hours. Clean stuffed animals, car seats, and other objects that might have come in contact with the infested person’s head. Vacuum carpets and upholstery. Pesticide sprays are not necessary. Avoid head-to-head contact with the infested person. Inform anyone who has been in close contact in the recent past. It’s not necessary to keep children home from school unless an extreme infestation is found. Consider treating infested scalps with a head louse insecticidal product. Effective, less toxic products contain dimethicone, benzyl alcohol, or spinosad. Avoid products containing permethrin, malathion, pyrethrin, and lindane, since head lice are often resistant to them (reducing their effectiveness). Lindane and malathion are also more toxic to humans. Check heads and remove eggs daily until infestation is gone. Follow with weekly head checks to detect reinfestation. Some people never itch so itching is not a reliable way to tell if someone is infested. ",

The adult thorax and forewings have tiny clear cells that form a lacelike covering, hence the name “lace bugs.” Adults are about 1/12 inch (2 mm) long, oval-shaped insects with a dark (black or brownish) head and thorax. Their abdomen, antennae, legs, and wing covers have both dark and light (brown, orangish, or white) areas. Eggs occur on the lower leaf surface, covered with black, sticky excrement. To the naked eye, eggs may resemble grains of black pepper. Beneath the excrement, eggs are oblong, yellowish, and have a white rim around the cap from which nymphs emerge. Nymphs are mostly black or dark brown with elaborate spiny projections, pale appendages, and (on the back of older nymphs) pale areas where wings are developing. Many landscape plants and some crops are attacked by other species of lace bugs. Most lace bug species feed on only one or a few closely related plants.

    "damagePestNote": "Lace bugs do not feed on fruit. They suck leaf sap, feeding in groups on the underside of leaves. A colony of lace bugs feeding causes faint pale green to yellowish blotches visible on both the lower and upper leaf surfaces. Black, shiny specks of excrement appear on the under leaf surface where lace bugs occur. As lace bugs continue feeding, large brown or tan dead blotches develop on leaves. Heavily damaged leaves become dry, may curl, and drop prematurely. Low lace bug populations do not damage trees. Severe leaf damage results in sunburned limbs and fruit when leaves fall from trees. Tree stress from defoliation reduces subsequent fruit yields. Severe lace bug damage has not been a reported problem on camphor trees. Other Causes. Be sure to distinguish avocado lace bug from other causes of damage so that you can take effective action. Thrips, mites, and certain diseases and disorders such as salt damage and sunburn can cause leaf damage superficially resembling that of lace bugs. For example, the pointed end of leaves often turns brown and dies from irrigating with salty water. This salt damage occurs primarily at the tip and margins of leaves, not in the middle of leaves and between the leaf veins as is common with lace bug damage. Thrips . Avocado thrips (Scirtothrips perseae) and greenhouse thrips (Heliothrips haemorrhoidalis) also feed on avocado leaves. Avocado thrips cause irregular bronzing or brown scarring on both sides of leaves, but this leaf scarring is harmless and not as apparent as that caused by avocado lace bug. Greenhouse thrips cause bleached or pale blotches and dark excrement on leaves, usually where leaves touch other leaves or fruit. Unlike lace bugs, thrips also feed on fruit, leaving scabby or leathery brown scars, whitish discoloration, or dark specks of excrement on fruit skins. Mites . Several species of mites discolor leaves, including avocado brown mite (Oligonychus punicae), persea mite (Oligonychus perseae), and sixspotted mite (Eotetranychus sexmaculatus). Depending on the species and abundance of mites, discoloring can be brown, silvery, or yellow roundish patches, brown to purplish irregular blotches, or browning or bronzing of leaves. Mite feeding can be distinguished from lace bugs by the absence of dark excrement, and sometimes by the presence of cast mite skins and fine silk webbing. Use a magnifying lens to examine leaves and determine whether tiny mites are abundant on the bottom side of leaves. More than one cause of damage can occur together on leaves. Learn to recognize the differences among these causes. Inspect plants carefully to correctly diagnose the cause of damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "Tolerate low populations of lace bugs, which are harmless to trees and provide food for predaceous insects that may help to prevent pest outbreaks. Keep trees healthy, primarily by providing good soil drainage, maintaining a thick layer of organic mulch beneath canopies, and applying appropriate amounts and frequency of irrigation. Conserve natural enemies by choosing “soft” materials such as insecticidal soaps or oil if pesticide application is warranted. Learn what pests and disorders can damage avocado. Check trees regularly for these pests, their damage symptoms, and any conditions and practices that can injure fruit or trees. Consult publications listed in Suggested Reading for more information. Exclude Foreign Pests Many of our worst pests were carelessly introduced. Until the 1990s when avocado thrips and persea mite were inadvertently introduced into California, invertebrates only occasionally damaged avocado fruit and leaves. The Caribbean, Central America, Florida, and Mexico have many avocado pests that do not occur in California. Do not bring uncertified budwood, fruit, plants, or soil into California. Buy plants and other garden and landscape products from reputable local sources. Do not move avocado or camphor plants or host foliage from infested areas to locations where avocado lace bugs do not occur. Take unfamiliar pests to your county agricultural commissioner or Cooperative Extension office for identification. For more information on exotic pests, telephone the California Department of Food and Agriculture, 1-800-491-1899, or visit the Web site. Cultural Control Provide trees with good growing conditions and appropriate cultural care. Well-cared for trees bear more fruit and are better able to tolerate and recover from any pest damage. Avocado trees are less tolerant of cold, salinity, and water-logged soil than most other fruit trees. Avocados do best where soil is well-drained and not too alkaline, and where they are irrigated with water low in salts. Retaining dropped leaves as mulch and applying additional coarse organic mulch beneath trees will improve avocado tree health and fruit yield. Modest amounts of nitrogen and occasional applications of potassium, phosphorus, and zinc are generally the only fertilization needed by California avocados. The appropriate frequency and amount of irrigation water is especially important to keep trees healthy.\tBiological Control\tNatural enemies are very important in controlling some species of lace bugs. Predators of lace bugs include lacewing larvae, lady beetles, jumping spiders, predatory thrips, and predaceous mites. No parasites have as yet been reported to attack avocado lace bug in California. Because it is an exotic, introduced pest, native parasites and predators are not expected to provide adequate control in many situations. However, preservation (conservation) of natural enemies is an essential part of a long-term integrated pest management program. At least two species of tiny parasitic wasps kill avocado lace bug eggs in Florida, an unidentified species in the family Mymaridae and an Oligosita sp. (Trichogrammatidae). Predatory thrips attack avocado lace bug in the Dominican Republic. Several species of predatory thrips occur in California avocado, including Franklinothrips orizabensis, which preys on small (early-instar) lace bug nymphs. For potential release in California, University of California scientists are searching in this pest’s native range for natural enemies that feed only on avocado lace bugs. Certain predators may be commercially available, but preliminary research indicates that purchasing and releasing predators is unlikely to be very effective. Chemical Control Do not treat low populations of lace bugs with an insecticide. If populations are increasing and are anticipated to cause intolerable damage (such as lace bugs caused defoliation in previous seasons) rely on “soft” or short-persistence materials such as insecticidal soaps or oils. Most contact insecticides kill avocado lace bugs if sprayed directly onto the insects. Insecticidal soap (M-Pede, Safer), narrow-range oil (Green Light, SunSpray, Volck), and the beneficial fungus Beauveria bassiana (BotaniGard) temporarily control lace bugs if the insecticide is thoroughly sprayed to cover the underside of infested leaves. These IPM-compatible insecticides have very low toxicity to humans and relatively low adverse impact on naturally occurring parasites and predators. Avoid broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, which kill many natural enemies and are contaminating urban surface water runoff and municipal wastewater because of their use around homes and in landscapes. Do not apply any pesticide when plants are drought-stressed, when it is windy, or when temperatures are over 90°F or below freezing. Any pesticide applied repeatedly or under adverse conditions may damage foliage. Use only oils that say “supreme” or “superior” or “narrow-range” on the label. These have a minimum unsulfonated residue (UR) of 92 and a minimum percent paraffin (% Cp) of 60%, characteristics that make an oil relatively safe for plants. Before applying insecticidal soap, consider making a test application to a portion of the foliage and observing it for damage over several days before spraying it further. Certain systemic insecticides (imidacloprid, the active ingredient in Bayer Advanced Garden Tree and Shrub Insect Control Concentrate), may provide the most effective control. Such treatments should have minimal impact on natural enemies that do not feed on treated plants. Be sure that avocado or “fruit trees” are listed on your product label. Some insecticides that can be applied for lace bugs infesting ornamental plants are not registered (not permitted) for use on avocado fruit trees. It may be unrealistic to expect good control when treating populations of pests that are already very abundant and high up in the tree canopy. Severely stressed or extensively damaged plants are more susceptible to being damaged by pesticides (phytotoxicity), especially if applications are made during adverse conditions such as hot weather or when trees are drought-stressed. Consider delaying any pesticide application until early the next season, when populations begin to increase and before damage becomes extensive. No treatment will restore damaged foliage, which remains until pruned off or replaced by new growth.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74155.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, is a tiny, mottled brown insect about the size of an aphid. This insect poses a serious threat to California's citrus trees because it vectors the pathogen that causes huanglongbing disease (HLB). This disease is the most serious threat to citrus trees worldwide—including those grown in home gardens and on farms. The psyllid feeds on all varieties of citrus (e.g., oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and mandarins) and several closely related ornamental plants in the family Rutaceae (e.g., calamondin, box orange, Indian curry leaf, and orange jessamine/orange jasmine). The Asian citrus psyllid (or ACP), damages citrus directly by feeding on newly developed leaves (flush). However, more seriously, the insect is a vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus, associated with the fatal citrus disease HLB, also called citrus greening disease. The psyllid takes the bacteria into its body when it feeds on bacteria-infected plants. The disease spreads when a bacteria-carrying psyllid flies to a healthy plant and injects bacteria into it as it feeds. HLB can kill a citrus tree in as little as 5 years, and there is no known cure or remedy. All commonly grown citrus varieties are susceptible to the pathogen. The only way to protect trees is to prevent the spread of the HLB pathogen by controlling psyllid populations and destroying any infected trees. The Asian citrus psyllid is widely distributed throughout Southern California and is becoming more widespread in the Central Valley and further north. The first tree with HLB was found in March 2012 in a home garden in Los Angeles County and a few years later was found in residences in Orange and Riverside Counties. Spread of the disease began to rapidly accelerate in these areas in 2017. Removal of infected trees by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) has occurred wherever they have been found. The presence of HLB in pockets of Southern California emphasizes that it is critical to control psyllid populations so that disease spread is limited. BACKGROUND The Asian citrus psyllid and the HLB disease originated in eastern Asia or the Indian subcontinent and then spread to other areas of the world where citrus is grown. The psyllid was first found in the United States in 1998 in Palm Beach County, Florida on backyard plantings of orange jessamine, Murraya paniculata, and spread rapidly over a 3-year period. HLB spread equally rapidly in Florida. In 2008, the Asian citrus psyllid was first detected in California. The psyllid spread throughout Southern California, particularly in urban and suburban environments, but also in commercial groves. The psyllid has since expanded its range to the Central Valley and the Central Coast, and has been found as far north as the San Francisco Bay Area and sites near Sacramento. The first infected tree found in California is believed to have been the result of illegal grafting of an infected bud (taking plant tissue from one tree and inserting it into another to form a new branch). The infected tree was destroyed to prevent further spread of the bacterium. Since that time, additional infected trees have been found in southern California’s residential areas; these may have resulted from illegally imported diseased trees, illegal grafting of infected budwood, and, more recently, the natural spread of the bacterium by the psyllid. CDFA is continuing to detect and eliminate infected trees. To protect the state's commercial and residential citrus from HLB, it is important to control the psyllid, prevent the accidental introduction of any infected host plant, and detect and remove any infected plants found in California as quickly as possible. The job of detecting infected trees is made difficult by the fact that it takes one to several years for symptoms of HLB to begin to show in the trees. Meanwhile, psyllids can pick up the HLB pathogen as nymphs and spread it only a few weeks after the tree is infected when they fly away as adults. Therefore, it is important to monitor and control psyllids in citrus trees and immediately report any suspected plant symptoms to the county agricultural commissioner.",

    "damagePestNote": "The Asian citrus psyllid damages citrus when its nymphs feed on new shoots and leaves. They remove sap from the plant tissue and inject a salivary toxin as they feed. This toxin can inhibit or kill new shoots, deforming new leaves by twisting and curling them. If the leaves mature after sustaining this damage then they will have a characteristic notch. There are many other insect pests that can cause twisting of leaves, such as aphids, citrus leafminer, and citrus thrips. The twisting of leaves doesn't harm trees and can be tolerated, but the death of new growth will retard the growth of young trees that are less than 5 years old. Excess sap (honeydew) that the psyllid nymphs excrete accumulates on leaf surfaces. This promotes the growth of sooty mold, which is unsightly but not harmful. Other insect pests of citrus also excrete honeydew, including aphids, whiteflies, and soft scales. Most importantly, the Asian citrus psyllid, through its feeding activity, can inoculates the tree with the bacterium that causes HLB, ultimately killing the tree. It only takes a few psyllids to spread the disease. HLB Disease An early symptom of HLB in citrus is the yellowing of leaves on an individual limb or in one sector of a tree's canopy. Leaves that turn yellow from HLB will show an asymmetrical pattern of blotchy yellowing or mottling of the leaf, with patches of green on one side of the leaf and yellow on the other side. Citrus leaves can turn yellow for many other reasons and often discolor from deficiencies of zinc or other nutrients. However, the pattern of yellowing caused by nutrient deficiencies typically occurs symmetrically (equally on both sides of the midvein), between or along leaf veins. As the disease progresses, the fruit size becomes smaller, and the juice turns bitter. The fruit may remain partially green, which is why the disease is also called citrus greening. The fruit becomes lopsided, has dark aborted seeds, and tends to drop prematurely. Chronically infected trees are sparsely foliated with small leaves that point upward, and the trees have extensive twig and limb dieback. Eventually, the tree stops bearing fruit and dies. Fruit and tree health symptoms may not begin to appear for 2 or more years after the bacteria infect a tree.",
    "managementPestNote": "In response to the establishment of ACP in California, CDFA began an extensive monitoring program to track the distribution of the insect and disease. This program involves CDFA and other personnel regularly checking thousands of yellow sticky traps for the psyllid, in both residential areas and commercial citrus groves throughout the state. The program also includes frequent testing of psyllids and leaf samples for the presence of the pathogen. Monitoring results are being used to delimit quarantine zones, guide releases of biological control agents, intensify testing for HLB, and prioritize areas for chemical control programs. In areas where HLB has been found, home gardeners need to take an active role in controlling the psyllid throughout the year, by watching for disease symptoms and supporting disease testing and tree removal activities. ACP and HLB Quarantines ACP quarantine zones have been established throughout the state that restrict movement of citrus trees and fruit in order to prevent psyllids from being moved to new, uninfested areas of California. Additional, more restrictive HLB quarantine zones have been established to help keep HLB from spreading. Citrus trees and close relatives that could be hosts of the psyllid can't be taken out of quarantine areas. Fruit can be moved, but only if it is washed and free of stems and leaves that could harbor psyllids. Whether you are inside or outside a quarantine area, it is very important to assist with the effort to reduce Asian citrus psyllids and report suspected HLB symptoms in your trees. Your efforts will slow the spread of HLB and provide time for scientists to work on finding a cure for the disease. For maps and information about the quarantine areas, see the UC ANR ACP Distribution and Management website. How You Can Help Residents and landscapers can help combat the psyllid by inspecting their citrus trees and reporting infestations of the Asian citrus psyllid in areas where they are not known to occur or suspected cases of the disease. For more photos of the Asian citrus psyllid and HLB symptoms, visit the California Citrus Threat website . The best way to detect psyllids is by looking at tiny newly-developing leaves on citrus trees whenever flush (clusters of new leaves) is forming. Mature citrus trees typically produce most of their new growth in the spring and fall, but young trees and lemons tend to flush periodically year round during warm weather. Slowly walk around each tree and inspect the flush. Look for signs of psyllid feeding and damage, including twisted or notched leaves, nymphs producing waxy deposits, honeydew, sooty mold, or adult psyllids. If you think psyllids are present, use a hand lens to look for small yellow eggs, psyllid nymphs with their waxy tubules, and adults. Immature stages (eggs and nymphs) are found on tender new leaves and they don't fly, so monitoring efforts are most effective when directed toward these stages on citrus flush. If you think you have found the insect, immediately contact the CDFA Exotic Pest Hotline at 1-800-491-1899. CDFA staff will tell you if you are in an area that is new to the psyllid or if it is common in your area. If you are in an area that is new to the psyllid, CDFA may come to your residence and take a sample. If the insect is identified as an Asian citrus psyllid, then the quarantine may expand to include that location, and citrus and other ACP host plants will be treated with insecticides by CDFA personnel to control the psyllid. In areas known to be widely infested with the psyllid, you will need to treat for the psyllid yourself. This can be confirmed by calling the CDFA hotline. This publication provides information on how you can treat your infested trees. If you need further assistance, contact your local UC Master Gardener program or a landscaping and pest control professional for more information about the steps you can take to control the psyllid. Monitoring citrus trees for symptoms of HLB disease is critical for early detection and management. Immediately report suspected cases of the disease to your county agricultural commissioner's office or call the CDFA hotline at 1-800-491-1899. If the tree is found to be infected with the HLB pathogen, it will be removed immediately to prevent further spread of the disease. It is critical that residents cooperate with tree removal. Symptoms of HLB take a long time to develop after a tree is first infected, perhaps upwards of 2 years or more for mature trees. However, infected trees can be a source of the bacterium for the psyllid much sooner. This means that in areas where HLB is known to be present, just because a tree looks to be free of HLB symptoms does not mean that it hasn’t been infected. Therefore, for residential areas where HLB is becoming widespread it is worth considering proactive removal of your citrus trees, even if they have not yet tested positive for the disease, to help contain HLB spread. At the very least, in these high HLB risk areas, home gardeners should be discouraged from planting new citrus trees given the high potential for them to become infected in the near future. Biological Control A number of predators and parasites feed on ACP. The nymphs are killed by tiny parasitic wasps and various predators, including lady beetle adults and larvae, syrphid fly larvae, lacewing larvae, and minute pirate bugs. Some spiders, birds, and other general predators feed on adult psyllids. Several species of tiny parasitoid wasps, collected by University of California researchers, have been brought to California for host-testing, mass-rearing, and release. The most promising of these, Tamarixia radiata, strongly prefers ACP nymphs, and under ideal conditions can significantly reduce psyllid populations. Females of this tiny wasp, which poses no threat to people, lay their eggs underneath ACP nymphs, and after hatching, the parasitoid larvae feed on and kill the psyllid. To find evidence of this wasp at work, keep an eye out for ACP “mummies”, which look like hollowed-out nymphal shells. This wasp has been released at thousands of sites throughout Southern California since early 2012. More recently, T. radiata releases have been made in Central California and a second wasp (Diaphorencyrtus aligarhensis) that attacks the younger ACP nymphs was released in Southern California. Tamarixia and other natural enemies have reduced ACP populations in Southern California, but they have not eradicated the pest and have not halted the spread of HLB. In the absence of ants, these beneficial insects will at least help to reduce psyllids, especially in areas where it is not possible or practical to institute chemical psyllid control measures. Visit the ACP Distribution and Management website to see a map of where these parasites have been released in California. Ant Control to Protect Natural Enemies Ants directly interfere with biological control of ACP, so it is very important for residents to control ants around their citrus trees. Ants “ farm ” the psyllid honeydew, feed it to their young and vigorously protect psyllids from predators and parasites (also called natural enemies). Ants do this to preserve this food source for their colony. Ant control is especially important in areas of California where the very aggressive Argentine ant is found. Argentine ants can significantly reduce Tamarixia and Diaphorencyrtis attack rates on ACP. For information on ant identification and management in the landscape, see the UC IPM Pest Notes: Ants . Chemical Control In areas where ACP has newly arrived, or where residential citrus trees are close to commercial citrus operations, CDFA conducts residential insecticide treatments to control psyllids. When a psyllid is found in these areas, all citrus and other ACP host plants on a property and nearby properties receive an application of two insecticides: a foliar pyrethroid insecticide to quickly kill adults and immature psyllids by direct contact and a soil-applied systemic insecticide to provide sustained control of nymphs tucked inside young leaves. This combination of treatments may protect trees against psyllids for many months. Home gardeners are encouraged to be vigilant and consider supplementary applications of their own when they see psyllids on their trees. Because of the threat ACP poses to both backyard and commercial citrus and the urgency of containing this pest, home gardeners outside the areas that are part of the CDFA residential treatment program are encouraged to consider implementing their own psyllid control measures if psyllids are found in their area. Home gardeners can hire a landscape pest control professional to apply insecticides, or make treatments themselves. Landscape professionals have access to the same pesticides applied by CDFA, which include the systemic imidacloprid and foliar applications of the pyrethroid beta-cyfluthrin. Home gardeners can apply broad-spectrum foliar sprays (carbaryl, malathion) to rapidly control adults and protect plants for many weeks. The systemic insecticide imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Fruit, Citrus & Vegetable and other products) is available for use as a soil drench, which moves through the roots to the growing tissues of the plant. This systemic insecticide provides good control of the nymphs for 1 to 2 months. Nymphs are hard to reach with foliar sprays because they are tucked inside the small, developing flush. Apply the soil drench during summer or fall when roots are actively growing. Broad-spectrum foliar sprays and systemic insecticides are toxic to honey bees, so don't apply them when the citrus trees are blooming. There are also a number of organic and \"soft\" foliar insecticides such as oils and soaps (horticultural spray oil, neem oil, insecticidal soap) that can help to reduce psyllids. These insecticides are generally lower in risk to beneficial insects (natural enemies and pollinators); however, they are also less persistent so applications need to be made frequently when psyllids are observed (every 7 to 14 days). Oil and soap insecticides must make direct contact with the psyllid so should be applied carefully to achieve full coverage of the tree. See the \"Active Ingredients Compare Risks\" button in this publication online for more information about potential hazards posed by these materials. Treatment Considerations\tAlways follow label instructions for the safe and effective use of the product.\tOnly apply insecticides if psyllids have been observed in your area.\tOnly apply insecticides to host plants of psyllids (citrus and closely related hosts).\tAvoid using insecticides during bloom to limit impacts on bees.\tThoroughly wet the foliage when spraying, including undersides of leaves.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Ants are among the most prevalent pests in households. Ants also invade restaurants, hospitals, offices, warehouses, and other buildings where they can find food and water. On outdoor and sometimes indoor plants, ants protect and care for honeydew-producing insects such as aphids, soft scales, whiteflies, and mealybugs, increasing damage from these pests. Ants also perform many useful functions in the environment, such as feeding on other pests (e.g., fleas, caterpillars, and termites), dead insects, and decomposing tissue from dead animals. There are more than 12,400 species of ants throughout the world. In California, there are about 270 species, but fewer than a dozen are important pests (Table 1). The most common ant in and around the house and garden in California is the Argentine ant, Linepithema humile (formerly Iridomyrmex humilis). Other common ant pests include the Pharaoh ant (Monomorium pharaonis), odorous house ant (Tapinoma sessile), thief ant (Solenopsis molesta), southern fire ant (S. xyloni), and pavement ant (Tetramorium caespitum). The velvety tree ants Liometopum occidentale and L. luctuosum nest in trees and are common outdoor species in landscapes. Less common, but of great importance, is the red imported fire ant, S. invicta, which gained a foothold in Southern California in 1998. In some areas, competition from the Argentine ant has slowed the spread of the fire ant. Carpenter ants, Camponotus species, and velvety tree ants also invade buildings in California. Although they don’t eat wood as termites do, they hollow it out to nest and may cause considerable damage. For more information about red imported fire ants or carpenter ants, see Pest Notes: Carpenter Ants and Pest Notes : Red Imported Fire Ant.",

    "damagePestNote": "Inside buildings, household ants feed on sugar, syrup, honey, fruit juice, fats, and meat. Long trails of thousands of ants may lead from nests to food sources, causing considerable concern among building occupants. Outdoors ants are attracted to honeydew that soft scales, mealybugs, and aphids produce. This liquid excrement contains sugars and other nutrients. Frequently outbreaks of scales and aphids occur when ants tend them for honeydew, because the ants protect scales and aphids from their natural enemies. Ants can bite with their pincerlike jaws, although most species rarely do. However, the velvety tree ant is an aggressive biter. A few ants sting, including native fire ants and harvester ants, which are primarily outdoor species and are the most common stinging ants in California. An aggressive stinging ant, the red imported fire ant has been found in various Southern California counties. If you suspect a fire ant infestation, report it to your county agricultural commissioner. For more information about red imported fire ants, see Pest Notes: Red Imported Fire Ant.",
    "managementPestNote": "Ant management requires diligent efforts and the combined use of mechanical, cultural, sanitation, and often chemical control methods. It is unrealistic and impractical to attempt to totally eliminate ants from an outdoor area. Focus your management efforts on excluding ants from buildings or valuable plants and eliminating their food and water sources. Reducing outdoor sources of ants near buildings will reduce the likelihood of ants coming indoors. Remember that ants often play a beneficial role in the garden. Become aware of the seasonal cycle of ants in your area and be prepared for annual invasions by caulking and baiting before the influx. Different species of ants respond to management practices differently. For management information specific to a particular species, see the Key to Identifying Common Household Ants. See also the videos related to ant management in the home. Monitoring and Inspecting Regularly inspecting your home for ants or ant entry points is an important part of an IPM program. Monitor for ants near attractive food sources or moist areas. Ants may invade kitchens, bathrooms, offices, or bedrooms. Inspect under sinks, in cupboards, and along pipes and electrical wires. Look for large trails of ants or for just a few stragglers. Straggling ants are scouts randomly searching for food or nesting sites. When you spot ant trails, try to follow the ants to where they are entering the building and to the nest if possible. Look indoors and outdoors for holes or cracks in foundations or walls that provide entry points to buildings. Exclusion and Sanitation To keep ants out of buildings, caulk cracks and crevices around foundations and other sites that provide entry from outside. Ants prefer to make trails along structural elements, such as wires and pipes, and frequently use them to enter and travel within a structure to their destination, so look for entry points in these locations. Prior to caulking, some pest management professionals may apply products containing silica aerogel (sometimes combined with pyrethrins in professional products such as EverGreen Pyrethrum Dust) into wall voids before sealing them up. Indoors, eliminate cracks and crevices wherever possible, especially in kitchens and other food-preparation and storage areas. Store attractive food items such as sugar, syrup, honey, and pet food in closed containers that have been washed to remove residues from outer surfaces. Rinse out empty soft drink containers or remove them from the building. Thoroughly clean up grease and spills. Remove garbage from buildings daily and change liners frequently. Look for indoor nesting sites, such as potted plants. If ants are found in potted plants, remove the containers from the building, then place the pots for 20 or more minutes in a solution of insecticidal soap and water at a rate of 1 to 2 tablespoons of insecticidal soap per quart of water. Submerge so the surface of the soil is just covered by the water-soap solution. Outdoor ant nests may be associated with plants that support large populations of honeydew-producing insects such as aphids, soft scales, mealybugs, or whiteflies. Avoid planting such trees and shrubs next to buildings, or manage honeydew-producing insects. Keep plants, grass, and mulch several inches away from the foundation of buildings, because these items provide nesting sites for ants. Fix leaky faucets and sprinkler heads; these attract thirsty ants. Trees and Shrubs When numerous ants are found on plants, they are probably attracted to the sweet honeydew deposited on the plants by honeydew-producing insects such as aphids or soft scales. Ants may also be attracted up into trees or shrubs by floral nectar or ripening or rotten sweet fruit. These ants can be kept out by banding tree trunks with sticky substances such as Tanglefoot. Trim branches to keep them from touching structures or plants so that ants are forced to try to climb up the trunk to reach the foliage. When using Tanglefoot on young or sensitive trees, protect them from possible injury by wrapping the trunk with a collar of heavy paper, duct tape, or fabric tree wrap and coating this with the sticky material. Check the coating every one or two weeks and stir it with a stick to prevent the material from getting clogged with debris and dead ants, which will allow ants to cross. Ant stakes with bait can also be used around trees. Baits Ant baits contain insecticides mixed with materials that attract worker ants looking for food. Baits are a key tool for managing ants and the only type of insecticide recommended in most situations. Ants are attracted to the bait and recruit other workers to it. Workers carry small portions of the bait back to the nest where it is transferred mouth to mouth to other workers, larvae, and queens to kill the entire colony. Bait products must be slow-acting so that the foraging ants have time to make their way back to the nest and feed other members of the colony before they are killed. When properly used, baits are more effective and safer than sprays. Baits are available in several different forms. For residential users, the most readily available forms are solids or liquids that are prepackaged into ant stakes or small plastic bait station containers . These products are easy to use and are quite safe if kept away from children and pets. Some products dry up rapidly and must be frequently replaced to manage a large population. A few boric acid products are liquids that are poured into refillable containers or applied as drops on cards. Reusable bait stations or dispensers are more useful than prepackaged baits for difficult ant problems. Reusable stations can be opened, checked, and refilled as needed. This is particularly important for liquid baits, which may be rapidly consumed or dry out. Some stations have removable cups that can be filled with two or more types of baits to offer ants a choice. Bait stations protect baits from photodegradation and disturbance by children. Some types of bait stations can be permanently installed into the ground or attached to outside walls or pavement in areas around schools or other buildings where ants are a frequent problem. The bait stations may be hidden in mulch so they aren’t immediately visible to children or pets. Gel formulations of pesticide baits are packaged in small tubes. They are applied in small cracks and crevices where ants are entering. Gel products are now available to home users as well as professionals and can be a useful tool in an IPM program. Ant baits contain carbohydrates (e.g., sugars), proteins, oils, or a combination of these as attractants along with an active ingredient (toxicant). Different attractants are more effective against different species of ants and at different times of the year. In the case of Argentine ants, sweet baits are attractive year-round. Protein baits are attractive to Argentine ants primarily in the spring. However, other ant species such as thief ants and Pharaoh ants prefer protein or greasy baits year-round. Fire ants prefer baits containing oils. See Table 1 for information on food preferences. Offering a small quantity of each kind of bait and observing which one the ants prefer is a good way to determine what to use. Look for the active ingredient listed on the label of bait products. Some examples of active ingredients include hydramethylnon, fipronil, boric acid (borate or various forms of sodium borate), and avermectin B (abamectin). Table 2 lists some common ant bait products organized by active ingredient. Bait products are constantly being improved. Look for new active ingredients and improvements to current products. Avoid products packaged as granules that contain the active ingredients cyfluthrin or permethrin. Although these products may be mistaken for baits, they are actually contact insecticides that rapidly kill foragers and don’t control the colony. Likewise, bait stations with propoxur or indoxacarb aren’t very effective, because the active ingredient is too fast-acting. To improve bait effectiveness, be sure to remove any particles of food, residues of sweet liquids, or other attractive material from cracks around sinks, pantries, and other ant-infested areas. For the most effective and economical control, use baits only when there is an ant problem. Treatments made in late winter and early spring when ant populations are just beginning to grow will be most effective. Ant preferences can change throughout the year; to increase your success rate, set out different formulations of various bait products in a single baiting station, giving ants a choice. Don’t use any insecticide sprays while you are using baits, and check and refresh bait stations regularly. Baits can dry up or become rancid and unattractive over time. Use baits primarily outdoors. Use indoors only if there is a serious infestation and you can’t find the spot where ants are entering the building: otherwise you could attract ants indoors. Outdoor baits draw ants out of buildings. Place bait stations where ants can easily find them, but avoid placing them in areas that are accessible to pets and small children. Place baits near nests, on ant trails beneath plants, or along edges where ants travel. Space them every 10 to 20 feet outside around the foundation and at nest openings, if they can be found. Effectiveness of baits will vary with ant species, bait material, and availability of alternative food. To achieve wide distribution of the bait so the entire colony will be killed, the bait toxicant must be slow-acting. Control with baits isn’t immediate and may take several weeks or more to be complete. Refillable Bait Stations for Argentine Ant Management. Currently the most effective baits available to consumers for Argentine ants are the borate-based baits. Prepackaged bait stations usually contain 5.4% borate. They can be effective at killing foragers in the home but are less effective at managing major infestations, because foragers are killed before they can bring the bait back to the colony. Liquid borate products with a lower percentage of active ingredient (0.5 to 1.0% concentration in a sugar-water solution) will have more impact on the colony, although it may take several days to a week to see results and they need to be used in larger, refillable bait stations. Products with the lower concentration of borates (e.g., Gourmet Liquid Ant Bait) are registered for home use but are difficult to find in stores and may have to be ordered online. Several refillable bait stations are available including the Ant Café, Antopia, Ant-No-More, and KM AntPro. University of California research with the KM AntPro dispenser has shown that it can be effective when properly installed and maintained outside the home. Usually at least one dispenser is installed around each side of a house and placed in shady areas where ants trail. Stations must be checked regularly and refilled as necessary. For more information about installation and maintenance, see\tthe video on refillable bait stations.\tTable 2.

Vacuuming up ant trails or sponging or mopping them with soapy water may be as effective as an insecticide spray in temporarily removing foraging ants in a building. Soapy water removes the ant’s scent trail, especially if thorough cleaning is done at the entry points. Some soap products such as window cleaners can kill ants on contact but leave no residual toxicity. Certain plant-based oils (e.g., peppermint, rosemary, clove, orange, and thyme) are formulated in pesticide-type products to be applied for this purpose, although as food-based products they aren’t required to be registered as pesticides. These types of products typically provide excellent contact activity but have limited residual activity against ants. Outdoor Insecticide Treatments A common practice used to prevent ants from coming indoors is to apply a perimeter treatment of residual sprays around the foundation. Commonly used insecticides include the pyrethroids bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and lambda-cyhalothrin. All are available in retail products, but products available to professionals provide longer residual control than home-use products. Spraying around the foundation won’t provide permanent control, because it kills only foraging ants without killing the colony and the queens. Typically the foragers represent only a small proportion of the colony. On occasion, barrier sprays make the situation worse by trapping ants indoors. Perimeter treatments may appear to knock down the population, but ants will quickly build back up and invade again. To try to achieve long-term control, some pest control companies offer every-other-month perimeter spray programs. Perimeter treatments pose more risk of environmental upset than baits in bait stations and are less effective than a bait-based IPM program. Because of water quality concerns, the California Department of Pesticide Regulation has recently adopted regulations limiting the use of perimeter treatments with pyrethroid insecticides. Baits in refillable bait stations provide the safest effective treatment for do-it-yourself ant management outdoors. Combined with the exclusion and sanitation practices discussed above, this approach should manage most home ant invasions. If a problem persists, the best option is to hire a pest management professional trained in IPM or IPM-certified by a reputable organization. These professionals have access to more effective materials (such as fipronil) and application equipment that can prevent contamination of the environment.

    "contentQuickTips": "Although ants are annoying when they come indoors, they can be beneficial by feeding on fleas, termites, and other pests in the garden. While spraying chemicals inside the house might seem effective, doing so will not prevent more ants from entering. Because most ants live outdoors, focus efforts on keeping ants from entering buildings. Combine several methods such as caulking entryways, cleaning up food sources, and baiting when necessary. Avoid using pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin and cypermethrin), especially on hard surfaces such as driveways or sidewalks or around the foundation of buildings. These products pollute waterways. Make your house less attractive to ants. Caulk cracks and crevices that provide entry into the house. Store food attractive to ants in closed containers. Clean up grease and spills. Ant-proof kitchen garbage pails with sticky barriers such as petroleum jelly under the lip and place pet dishes in a moat of water. Remove or manage sweet food sources next to your house such as aphid-infested bushes and ripened fruit on trees. Keep plants, grass, and organic mulch at least a foot away from the foundation of buildings to reduce ant foraging and nesting. When ants invade your house. Sponge up invading ants with soapy water as soon as they enter. Plug up ant entryways with caulk. Take infested potted plants outdoors and submerge pots in a solution of insecticidal soap and water. Clean up food sources by wiping up spills or placing food in tight-fitting containers. Rely on outdoor baits to control the ant colony. Insecticide sprays shouldn’t be necessary. If you hire a pest control company, ask them to use baits and spot treatments rather than perimeter treatments or monthly sprays. How ant baits work: Pesticide baits work by attracting worker ants who then take the product back to the nest where the entire colony, including queens, can be killed. The pesticide must be slow acting so workers won’t be killed before they get back to the nest. How to use baits: Place baits near ant trails and nest openings. Prepackaged or refillable bait stations or stakes are the safest and easiest to use. Active ingredients in baits may include boric acid/borate, fipronil, avermectin, or hydramethylnon. Liquid borate (0.5-1% borate in sugar water solution) baits in refillable bait stations are best for severe Argentine ant infestations. Replace baits when empty and reposition them, or try a different bait product if ants don't appear to be taking it. It can take 5 to 10 days to see fewer ants. ",

The hobo spider does not live in California. There are many cases, however, of common related spiders being misidentified as hobo spiders by the general public and even by pest control operators.

However, there have been no documented verifications by a qualified arachnologist (spider specialist) to date. Interest in the hobo spider has been growing in California because it is rumored to cause necrotic (rotting flesh) wounds similar to the occasionally-dramatic bites from brown recluse spiders, another spider that does not occur in California.

    "managementPestNote": "Because the hobo spider is not known to live in California, there is no need for control. However, reducing trash and rubble around the house and sealing windows and door jambs will help to reduce the number of spiders and other arthropods that can gain access into the home. In the garage (a well-known haven for spiders), use plastic bags tightly sealed to store items that are used only sporadically such as gardening apparel (gloves, old shirts, boots) and sports gear (baseball mitts, roller skates). This will help to minimize encounters with spiders but not eliminate them completely. Typically, pesticide applications targeting spiders are variable in efficacy unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it directly. Various insecticides are available in retail outlets labeled for spider control. It is just as easy, and much less toxic, to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe. Sticky traps placed along floorboards out of the reach of pets and young children offer a nonchemical way to trap spiders as well as provide an idea of population levels in the structure. A simple and effective way to minimize indoor spider populations is regular vacuuming, especially under furniture and in other nooks and crannies. You can also remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar to seal off the opening. If you plan to send the spider to an expert for identification, try to keep it in an undamaged condition, because a crushed specimen may be difficult to identify.",

Many aphid species are difficult to distinguish from one another; however, management of most aphid species is similar.",
    "damagePestNote": "Low to moderate numbers of leaf-feeding aphids aren't usually damaging in gardens or on trees. However, large populations can turn leaves yellow and stunt shoots ; aphids can also produce large quantities of a sticky exudate known as honeydew, which often turns black with the growth of a sooty mold fungus. Some aphid species inject a toxin into plants, which causes leaves to curl and further distorts growth. A few species cause gall formations. Aphids may transmit viruses from plant to plant on certain vegetable and ornamental plants. Squash, cucumber, pumpkin, melon, bean, potato, lettuce, beet, chard, and bok choy are crops that often have aphid-transmitted viruses associated with them. The viruses mottle, yellow, or curl leaves and stunt plant growth. Although losses can be great, they are difficult to prevent by controlling aphids, because infection occurs even when aphid numbers are very low; it takes only a few minutes for the aphid to transmit the virus, while it takes a much longer time to kill the aphid with an insecticide. A few aphid species attack parts of plants other than leaves and shoots. The lettuce root aphid is a soil dweller that attacks lettuce roots in spring and summer, causing lettuce plants to wilt and occasionally die. In fall, this species often moves to poplar trees, where it overwinters in the egg stage and produces leaf galls in spring. The woolly apple aphid infests woody parts of apple roots and limbs, often near pruning wounds, and can cause overall tree decline if roots are infested for several years. Heavy infestations of crown and root aphids on carrots may weaken tops, causing them to tear off when carrots are harvested.",
    "managementPestNote": "Although aphids seldom kill a mature plant, the damage they do and unsightly honeydew they generate sometimes warrant control. Consider the nonchemical controls discussed below, as most insecticides will destroy beneficial insects along with the pest. On mature trees, such as in citrus orchards, aphids and the honeydew they produce can provide a valuable food source for beneficial insects. Monitoring Check your plants regularly for aphids—at least twice a week when plants are growing rapidly—in order to catch infestations early, so you can knock or hose them off or prune them out. Many species of aphids cause the greatest damage in late spring when temperatures are warm but not hot (65°-80°F). For aphids that cause leaves to curl, once aphid numbers are high and they have begun to distort leaves, it's often difficult to control these pests, because the curled leaves shelter aphids from insecticides and natural enemies. Aphids tend to be most prevalent along the upwind edge of the garden and close to other infested plants of the same species, so make a special effort to check these areas. Many aphid species prefer the underside of leaves, so turn leaves over when checking for aphids. On trees, clip off leaves from several areas of the tree. Also check for evidence of natural enemies such as lady beetles, lacewings, syrphid fly larvae, and the mummified skins of parasitized aphids. Look for disease-killed aphids as well; they may appear off color, bloated, flattened, or fuzzy. Substantial numbers of any of these natural control factors can mean the aphid population may be reduced rapidly without the need for treatment. Ants are often associated with aphid populations, especially on trees and shrubs, and frequently are a clue that an aphid infestation is present. If you see large numbers of ants climbing your tree trunks, check higher up the tree for aphids or other honeydew-producing insects that might be on limbs and leaves. To protect their food source, ants ward off many predators and parasites of aphids. Managing ants is a key component of aphid management. (See Cultural Control.) In landscape settings, you can monitor aphids by using water-sensitive paper to measure honeydew dripping from a tree. This type of monitoring is of particular interest where there is a low tolerance for dripping honeydew, such as in groups of trees along city streets or in parks and for tall trees where aphid colonies may be located too high to detect. (See Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs in References for more details.) Biological Control Natural enemies can be very important for controlling aphids, especially in gardens not sprayed with broad-spectrum pesticides (e.g., organophosphates, carbamates, and pyrethroids) that kill natural enemy species as well as pests. Usually natural enemy populations don't appear in significant numbers until aphids begin to be numerous. Among the most important natural enemies are various species of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside aphids. The skin of the parasitized aphid turns crusty and golden brown, a form called a mummy. The generation time of most parasites is quite short when the weather is warm, so once you begin to see mummies on your plants, the aphid population is likely to be reduced substantially within a week or two. Many predators also feed on aphids. The most well known are lady beetle adults and larvae, lacewing larvae, soldier beetles, and syrphid fly larvae. Naturally occurring predators work best, especially in garden and landscape situations. For photos and more information about aphid natural enemies, see the Natural Enemies Gallery . Lady Beetle Releases Applying commercially available lady beetles (the convergent lady beetle, Hippodamia convergens) may give some temporary control when properly handled, although most of them will disperse from your yard within a few days. If releasing lady beetles, keep them refrigerated until just before letting them go, doing so at dusk, as those released in broad daylight will fly away immediately. Mist the lady beetles with water just before release, and also mist the surface of the plant you are releasing them onto. Place the lady beetles at the base of infested plants or in the crotches of low branches. Lady beetles will crawl higher into the plant in search of aphids. University of California research indicates that high numbers of lady beetles are required to control aphids. One large, heavily infested rose bush required two applications, spaced a week apart, of about 1,500 lady beetles each. For more information about making lady beetle releases, see UC IPM's convergent lady beetle page in the Natural Enemies Gallery. Aphids are very susceptible to fungal diseases when it is humid. These pathogens can kill entire colonies of aphids when conditions are right. Look for dead aphids that have turned reddish or brown; they'll have a fuzzy, shriveled texture unlike the shiny, bloated, tan-colored mummies that form when aphids are parasitized. Weather can also impact aphids. Summer heat in the Central Valley and desert areas reduces the populations of many species, and aphid activity is also limited during the coldest part of the year. However, some aphids may be active year-round, especially in the milder, central coastal areas of California. Ant Management In some situations ants tend aphids and feed on the honeydew aphids excrete. At the same time, ants protect the aphids from natural enemies. If you see ants crawling up aphid-infested trees or woody plants, put a band of sticky material (e.g., Tanglefoot) around the trunk to prevent ants from climbing up. (Don't apply sticky material directly to the bark of young or thin-barked trees or to trees that have been severely pruned, as the material may have phytotoxic effects. Wrap the trunk with fabric tree wrap or duct tape and apply sticky material to the wrap.) Alternatively, ant stakes or containerized baits may be used on the ground to control ants without affecting aphids or their natural enemies. Prune out other ant routes such as branches touching buildings, the ground, or other trees. Cultural Control Before planting vegetables, check surrounding areas for sources of aphids and remove these sources. Some aphids build up on weeds such as sowthistle and mustards, moving onto related crop seedlings after they emerge. On the other hand, these aphid-infested weeds can sometimes provide an early source of aphid natural enemies. Always check transplants for aphids and remove them before planting. Where aphid populations are localized on a few curled leaves or new shoots, the best control may be to prune out these areas and dispose of them. In large trees, some aphids thrive in the dense inner canopy; pruning out these areas can make the habitat less suitable. High levels of nitrogen fertilizer favor aphid reproduction, so never use more nitrogen than necessary. Instead, use a less soluble form of nitrogen and apply it in small portions throughout the season rather than all at once. Slow-release fertilizers such as organic fertilizers or urea-based time-release formulations are best. Because many vegetables are susceptible to serious aphid damage primarily during the seedling stage, reduce losses by growing seedlings under protective covers in the garden, in a greenhouse, or inside and then transplanting them when the seedlings are older and more tolerant of aphid feeding. Protective covers will also prevent transmission of aphid-borne viruses. Silver-colored reflective mulches have been successfully used to reduce transmission of aphid-borne viruses in summer squash, melon, and other susceptible vegetables. These mulches repel invading aphid populations, reducing their numbers on seedlings and small plants. Another benefit is that yields of vegetables grown on reflective mulches are usually increased by the greater amount of solar energy reflecting onto leaves. To put a reflective mulch in your garden, remove all weeds and cover beds with mulch. Bury the edges with soil to hold them down. After the mulch is in place, cut or burn 3- to 4-inch diameter holes and plant several seeds or a single transplant in each one. In addition to repelling aphids, leafhoppers, and some other insects, the mulch will enhance crop growth and control weeds. When summertime temperatures get high, however, remove mulches to prevent overheating plants. Ready-to-use reflective mulch products include silver-colored plastic sold in rolls. You can also make your own by spray-painting construction paper, landscape fabric, or clear plastic. If you use plastic mulches, you will need to use drip irrigation underneath. Landscape fabric and most paper mulches will allow water to flow through. Another way to reduce aphid populations on sturdy plants is to knock off the insects with a strong spray of water. Most dislodged aphids won't be able to return to the plant, and their honeydew will be washed off as well. Using water sprays early in the day allows plants to dry off rapidly in the sun and be less susceptible to fungal diseases. Chemical Control When considering whether to apply insecticides for aphid control, remember that most larger plants can tolerate light to moderate levels of aphids with little damage. Larger aphid populations often rapidly decline due to biological control or when hot temperatures arrive. Often a forceful spray of water or water-soap solution, even on large street trees, when applied with appropriate equipment, will provide sufficient control. If insecticides are needed, insecticidal soaps and oils are the best choices for most situations. Oils may include petroleum-based horticultural oils or plant-derived oils such as neem or canola oil. These products kill primarily by smothering the aphid, so thorough coverage of infested foliage is required. Apply these materials with a high volume of water, usually a 1 to 2% oil solution in water, and target the underside of leaves as well as the top. Soaps, neem oil, and horticultural oil kill only aphids present on the day they are sprayed, so applications may need to be repeated. Although these materials can kill some natural enemies that are present on the plant and hit by the spray, they leave no toxic residue so they don't kill natural enemies that migrate in after the spray. These and other insecticides with contact-only activity are generally ineffective in preventing damage from aphids such as the leaf curl plum aphid or the woolly ash aphid, which are protected by galls or distorted foliage. Also, don't use soaps or oils on water-stressed plants or when the temperature exceeds 90°F. These materials may be phytotoxic to some plants, so check labels and test the materials on a portion of the foliage several days before applying a full treatment. Supreme- or superior-type oils will kill overwintering eggs of aphids on fruit trees if applied as a delayed-dormant application just as eggs are beginning to hatch in early spring. (On plums dormant applications right after leaves have fallen in early November are preferred.) These treatments won't give complete control of aphids and probably aren't justified for aphid control alone but will also control soft scale insects if they are a problem. Common aphid species controlled with these types of oils include the woolly apple aphid, green apple aphid, rosy apple aphid, mealy plum aphid, and black cherry aphid. Many other insecticides are available to control aphids in the home garden and landscape, including foliar-applied formulations of malathion, permethrin, and acephate (nonfood crops only). While these materials may kill higher numbers of aphids than soaps and oils, their use should be limited, because they also kill the natural enemies that provide long-term control of aphids and other pests, and they are associated with bee kills and environmental problems. Repeated applications of these materials may also result in resistance to the material. Insecticides such as oils and soaps are also safer to use when children and pets may be present. Formulations combining insecticidal soaps and pyrethrins may provide slightly more knockdown than soaps alone yet have fewer negative impacts on natural enemies than malathion, permethrin, and acephate, because pyrethrins break down very quickly. Systemic insecticides are also available for aphid management, primarily for woody ornamentals. These materials, including imidacloprid, are very effective and are especially useful for serious infestations of aphids such as the woolly hackberry aphid, which is often not effectively controlled by biological control or less toxic insecticides. Imidacloprid can have negative impacts on predators, parasitoids, and pollinators, so its use should be avoided where soaps and oils will provide adequate control. To protect pollinators, don't apply imidacloprid or other systemic insecticides to plants in bloom or prior to bloom. Home-use soil-applied imidacloprid products are often diluted with water in a bucket and poured around the base of the tree or plant. Professional applicators can use soil injectors, which provide better control with less runoff potential. Applications are usually made in spring when aphids first become apparent. Adequate rain or irrigation is required to move the product through the soil to the roots and up into large trees, and it may take several weeks to see an effect on aphids feeding on leaves. One application on hackberry is enough to control hackberry woolly aphid for two to three years. See Pest Notes: Hackberry Woolly Aphid for more discussion about control methods using imidacloprid.\tTable 1.

    "contentQuickTips": "Almost every plant has one or more aphid species that occasionally feed on it, but low to moderate numbers of aphids usually aren’t damaging to gardens or landscape trees. Although aphids can curl leaves and produce sticky honeydew, they rarely kill plants, and can usually be washed off with water. When aphid numbers are high, natural enemies often feed on them, eliminating the need for pesticides. When pesticides are necessary, use less-toxic products such as insecticidal soaps and oils. Aphids are common in gardens. Aphids like lush, new growth. Don’t over fertilize; use organic or slow-release products. Aphids build up on flowering plums, roses, tulip trees, crape myrtles, apples, and many vegetables. Expect aphids when you grow these plants. Ants protect aphids from their natural enemies. Keep ants off plants to help these beneficial insects do their job. How can I reduce aphids? Prune infested leaves and stems. Knock aphid populations off plants by shaking the plant or spraying it with a strong stream of water. Protect seedlings with covers or aluminum foil mulches. Wait for hot weather; some aphids are heat-intolerant and will be gone by mid-summer. Are there any good bugs that will eat aphids? Beneficial insects such as lady beetles and lacewings will visit plants naturally when aphids are abundant. Protect these natural enemies by avoiding the use of insecticides that can be toxic to them. Common natural enemies of aphids include: Lady beetles (ladybugs), both adults and larvae Lacewings Syrphid fly larvae Soldier beetles Tiny parasitic wasps that turn aphids into crusty “mummies” What about pesticides? Use nonchemical methods first to manage aphid populations. If insecticides seem necessary, choose the safest products, such as insecticidal oils and soaps. When properly used, these materials solve most aphid problems. Oils and soaps work by smothering aphids, so apply these products thoroughly. Don’t apply them to drought-stressed plants or when it is very hot. Some plants are sensitive to these products. Apply insecticidal soaps, soap-pyrethrum mixtures, or neem oils on vegetables or small bushes such as roses. Narrow range horticultural oils—such as supreme or superior oils—are appropriate for larger trees. Oils and soaps don’t kill aphids hidden within curled leaves. Prune these out. Systemic insecticides can kill hidden aphids, but they are much more toxic and might kill bees and other beneficial insects on flowering plants. ",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Woodpeckers (Melanerpes spp.), including sapsuckers (Sphyrapucys spp.), and flickers (Colaptes spp.) belong to an interesting and well-known group of birds in the family Picidae. There are 17 species found in California, two of which are California-listed endangered species. Woodpeckers vary in size and range from about 7 to 14 inches in length, usually with brightly contrasting coloration. Most males have some red on the head, and black and white markings are common on many species. They have short legs with two sharp-clawed backward pointed toes and stiff tail feathers that serve as a support prop. Such physical traits permit them to cling easily to trees or wood surfaces. They have stout, sharply pointed beaks and a long tongue for extracting larvae and other insects from wood crevices. Because they are dependent on trees for shelter and food, woodpeckers are commonly found within or on the fringes of wooded or forested areas. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Woodpeckers come into conflict with people when they use human dwellings in their search of food, or as a surface for territorial/social drumming, or for nest construction. Such activities not only create disturbing noises but, more significantly, may cause structural damage. Pecking damage can occur on wooden siding, eaves, or trim boards. Cedar and redwood siding seem most vulnerable, especially rough-hewn veneer-type plywood. Reverse board-and-batten veneer plywood is especially prone because of gaps created as a result of the manufacturing process. These gaps provide hidden spaces that harbor insects, which in turn, attract woodpeckers in search of food. When searching for insects, woodpeckers leave a series of small holes all in a row, which is characteristic damage. Woodpeckers will also peck larger holes in wood siding to create nests in the wall cavity. Exploratory pecking is commonplace. The damage tends to be on houses in or near natural wooded areas and most often occurs in suburban or rural settings. Part of a woodpecker's breeding behavior is an incessant rhythmic tapping or repetitive drumming on wood or other hard surfaces using the bill as a way of proclaiming breeding territory and social significance. Woodpeckers prefer drumming surfaces that resonate loudly. They frequently bypass wood and use metal gutters and downspouts, television antennae, or metal rooftop ventilators. Both male and female woodpeckers drum. This activity may be annoying to household residents, especially if it starts in the early morning hours. Gardeners and landscapers are sometimes confronted with a series of small holes in rows pecked through the bark of a tree trunk or tree limb by a sapsucker seeking food. Over time, this continuous activity extends the number of rows of holes and the resulting loss of sap may weaken the tree and provide access for harmful insects or plant diseases. Some species of woodpeckers feed on fruits, berries, and nuts, but crop damage rarely constitutes a significant problem. Acorn woodpeckers place numerous acorns in holes they drill in buildings, wooden fence posts, utility poles, and old tree snags. The acorn woodpecker may also take a quicker approach and wedge acorns beneath wooden shakes or shingles and, in the process, be very destructive. Acorn woodpeckers may accumulate and store hundreds to thousands of acorns in a single season. LEGAL STATUS All woodpeckers are protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 as migratory insectivorous birds and are classified as non-game by the state. Two California woodpeckers (Gila woodpecker, Melanerpes uropygialis, and Gilded northern flicker, Colaptes auratus chrysoides) are California-listed endangered species and are offered greater protection. When warranted, woodpeckers other than endangered species can be killed, but only under a permit issued by the Law Enforcement Division of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service upon recommendation of the United States Department of Agriculture, Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS) Wildlife Services personnel. Generally there must be a good case to justify a permit and the permit process is time consuming. Control methods that do not harm the bird or its active nest are allowed except for the two endangered species. Those species cannot be harassed or bothered in any way. Physical exclusion, if installed before the endangered species is in the area, is allowed. For more information on these and other endangered species, see the California Department of Fish and Game Web site, or contact the main office of USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services in your state.",

    "managementPestNote": "Several methods have been used to prevent damage or to frighten woodpeckers from a site. Physical exclusion is by far the most effective. More often than not, frightening devices or repellents fail to provide the desired result. Physical Exclusion Installing bird-type netting to prevent woodpeckers from gaining access to wood siding or other wood surfaces is the most effective method to stop building damage. The lightweight, plastic, 3/4-inch mesh is stretched from the eaves to a lower point on the building. Alternatively, the netting can be stretched over any flat surface subject to damage, leaving at least three inches of space between the netting and damaged surface so that the birds cannot cause further damage through the mesh. If the appropriate type and color of netting is selected and properly installed, it is barely visible from a distance of a few yards and will offer a long-term solution to prevent subsequent damage. Remember that you may have to net the entire side of a building; otherwise the woodpecker may move just beyond the netted area and continue its activities. If a plastic net is used, it should be attached so that so that it can be pulled taut. This prevents flapping in the wind, which looks unsightly and results in tangles or breakage at mounting points. The net should not have any loose pockets or wrinkles that could trap and entangle birds. Netting can be attached using tape, staples, or hooks on the eaves and the side of the building. An advantage of hooks is that the net can be taken down for maintenance of light fixtures, painting, etc. If staples are used, they should be rust-resistant to avoid unsightly rust stains on the building. When using hooks, a supporting framework of wooden dowels, wood laths, or metal rods along the netting edges will ease attachment and create uniform tension on the net. Netting may also be wrapped once or twice around wood laths and nailed directly to the building. It should extend from the outer eaves edge down the side of the building to the point where the eaves' protection from the elements is lost. Extensive netting may be a bigger task than some homeowners want to assume, especially if it involves a two-story building. In this case, it may be advisable to call a bird control professional; look under \"pest control\" in the telephone directory. Netting is increasingly used to curtail woodpecker damage because it consistently provides the desired result. Sections of lightweight sheet metal or 1/4-inch hardware cloth may be fastened directly over the woodpecker-damaged areas. If done at the first sign of damage the bird may be discouraged and move on to another location. This metal sheeting or wire mesh can be painted to match the siding. This method is most useful where only one or a few relatively small areas have been damaged. Wire mesh, such as chicken wire, wrapped around tree trunks or limbs being damaged by a sapsucker will often persuade the bird to relocate. In most cases, it will be necessary to protect a large area with mesh because the woodpecker will move to a nearby area and begin pecking again. Bird netting is available at many hardware and farm supply stores as well as from Internet sources. Frightening Devices Models of hawks, owls, and snakes are ineffective as frightening devices. Plastic twirlers or windmills fastened to the eaves, and aluminum foil or brightly colored plastic strips hung from above repel by movement and reflection and have been used with inconsistent success. Various other gadgets or devices are marketed for frightening woodpeckers, including a sound-activated giant model of a climbing spider. Some claim that various frightening devices resolved their particular problem. This is possible only if the woodpecker has not become well-attached to that particular location. Once established, woodpeckers are persistent and are not easily driven from their territory or selected pecking site. Repellents Many chemicals having objectionable tastes or odors have been tested for repelling woodpeckers with little or no success. This search continues and in the future something effective may be found. On buildings sticky or tacky bird repellents such as Tanglefoot are sometimes effective if applied to sections of thin plywood and placed over the damaged area. The substances do not entrap the birds, but they dislike the tacky footing. Applying sticky or tacky bird repellents can sometimes be an effective solution to the problem of sapsucker attacks on trees. Other Control Methods Woodpeckers can be removed only with a permit specifying trapping or shooting as the control method. Other methods that are sometimes suggested include feeding suet to the woodpecker in the hope of discouraging damage. Placing nest boxes on nearby buildings, poles, or trees has also been advised. However, research shows that placing food or nesting boxes in the area does not consistently reduce the problem. These methods may, in fact, attract more woodpeckers. Woodpeckers, like many other birds, are so visible that little specific monitoring information is needed. In the case of woodpeckers, they may be heard pecking and drumming even before they are seen. Hearing their activity over several consecutive days is a cue to make a visual inspection. Vacation homes in forested areas should be checked for damage several times during the spring and summer.",

    "damagePestNote": "Wild pigs impact ecosystems through their rooting, wallowing, foraging, and hunting, with a conservative annual estimate of $1.5 billion in economic damage nationally to agriculture and the environment. They are highly competitive for food resources and have been known to drive cattle away from supplement. Deer are also known to vacate an area, such as a water source, upon the arrival of wild pigs. Their rooting behavior overturns and tills the soil, uprooting plants, exposing bare soil, and creating opportunities for weeds to invade. They disturb native and naturalized vegetation and reduce available forage for livestock and other wildlife. Their wallowing disturbs springs and seeps, and they are known to cause damage to stock water troughs by rooting around their bases and undermining the troughs. Their rooting and wallowing behavior also disturbs riparian areas and reduces habitat suitability for native and endangered wildlife species. In urban areas, the rooting behavior of wild pigs can cause extensive damage to lawns and gardens. The foraging behavior and dietary preferences of wild pigs makes them highly competitive with other wildlife species. Many native wildlife species (e.g., black bear (Ursus americanus) and mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus)) are highly dependent on hard mast crops, which are known to be a favorite of wild pigs. In years where hard mast crops are small, wild pigs may invade and rob the underground caches of small mammal species. Wild pigs have been implicated in the reduced regeneration of oak trees in California due to their rooting behavior and their affinity for acorns. However, it has been proposed that wild pigs may instead facilitate oak regeneration because they do not generally consume all available acorns and may actually “plant” some through their rooting behavior; but there is no scientific evidence to support this theory. In fact, one study found that high density populations of wild pigs led to lower acorn survival. Wild pigs can be a major nuisance for farmers and ranchers, as they will invade farm fields and eat crops, disturb plantings by rooting through the soil, defecate in fields leaving behind fecal coliforms that may be infectious to humans, and pose a serious risk to human and livestock health by serving as vectors for numerous diseases and parasites. In California, damage from wild pigs can be quite high. One study noted a 6 – 10% loss in revenue in various agricultural commodities when wild pigs are present, while a study in Texas estimated $57 million worth of damage caused by wild pigs to crops annually. Wild pigs carry five major waterborne pathogens that can be infectious to humans. These five pathogens are: E.coli, Campylobacter, Salmonella, Cryptosporidium, and Giardia. For example, after the E. coli outbreak in spinach from California fields in 2006, E. coli was isolated from both cattle and wild pigs. Although the exact source could not be verified, wild pigs were considered the prime suspect. In another study in Texas, six of seven wild pigs tested positive for E. coli . Additionally, wild pigs increase turbidity in water sources by stirring up sediment. Turbidity, or the relative cloudiness of water, is a critical factor affecting the survival of waterborne pathogens. As turbidity increases, the survival rate of waterborne pathogens, including E. coli, also increases. Further, high levels of turbidity can protect waterborne pathogens during the chemical disinfection process used in water treatment facilities. Wild pigs pose a significant potential disease threat to humans, domestic livestock, and native wildlife and are hosts to at least 37 parasites that can affect multiple species. Wild pigs can carry potentially devastating diseases to domestic livestock and wildlife including pseudorabies, foot and mouth disease, swine brucellosis, bovine tuberculosis, and classical swine fever. Given the diverse hazards posed by wild pigs, combined with the extreme negative economic impact they often impose, an effective management program is warranted. LEGAL STATUS Wild pigs are classified as a game animal by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, and a license and tag is required to hunt them. If wild pigs are causing damage to property, depredation permits are available for removing nuisance individuals. Unmarked, free-roaming domestic pigs are legally equivalent to wild pigs.",
    "managementPestNote": "Wild pigs can be managed through small-scale exclusion, trapping, and/or shooting. While recreational hunting is often a preferred method, it is not effective at controlling wild pig population growth. Trapping, however, is highly effective at controlling and reducing wild pig population growth. All methods of control are only effective long-term if adjacent property owners work together cooperatively to reduce population size; otherwise, even the most efficient wild pig removal programs will suffer from frequent reinvasion from neighboring pig populations. Exclusion Excluding wild pigs using fencing is an effective option, although it can be expensive. However, if implemented on a small scale, it can be practical. Wild pigs are strong enough to upturn many types of fences and simply go under them by utilizing their natural rooting instinct. If wild pigs are excluded using a fence, it should be monitored closely to watch for signs that the perimeter has been breached. For more information on how to properly construct wild pig exclusionary fences, see the References section. Trapping Trapping is a common and effective method of removing wild pigs. There are two types of traps that are most commonly used with wild pigs, box traps and corral traps. Box traps are usually relatively small, about 4’ x 4’ x 8’, and constructed using heavy duty welded framing as well as wire paneling. A door system with a trip wire is used to allow entry but prevent escape from the trap. Some box traps are equipped with what is known as a rooting door, which allows multiple pigs to enter by utilizing their natural rooting tendencies but prevents escape. Corral traps are generally larger than box traps and designed to capture larger numbers of wild pigs. Corral traps are either round or square, although round traps are recommended over square traps because pigs tend to pile up in the corners of square traps and will climb on top of each other to escape the trap. If a square corral trap is used, it is recommended that the corners be adequately covered to prevent pigs from climbing out. The two basic door types used in corral traps are the same as those used in box traps. Either a drop gate, triggered by a trip wire, is used or a rooting door on springs is used. In the case of the drop gate, the trip wire is generally attached to something of interest to the pigs at the furthest end of the trap from the door. This allows more than one pig to enter in search of food before the trip wire is triggered and the door drops closed. Corral traps are preferred by many because entire sounders can be captured at once, which helps prevent trap education of other wild pigs. Traps are baited with a number of food substances intended to draw wild pigs in as they search for food. Recommendations include corn, barley, oats, carrion, fruit, and fermented corn or soybeans, although any food that the wild pigs are currently feeding on is a good option. Trapping is considered more of an art than a science, and it may take some time to determine which bait works best. Some have developed mechanical feeding devices, like a 55-gallon drum with small holes that lets bait out. This allows wild pigs to access the bait but prevents smaller, non-target species from consuming bait. Pre-baiting traps can significantly improve the success rate of a trapping program. It is important to ensure a steady bait supply, check traps daily, and check traps from a distance. If trapped pigs are approached, they may become agitated and attempt to escape the trap. Wild pigs are large, strong animals; and traps must be constructed using materials that can withstand the force of agitated individuals. For more information on trapping and how to build and bait traps, see the References section. OTHER CONTROL METHODS Shooting is a popular method of controlling wild pig populations; however, recreational hunting alone is not an effective control method. Pressure from hunting will drive wild pigs to move away from where they are hunted or, at a minimum, will restrict their movements. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife maintains a “Guide to Hunting Wild Pigs in California” on their website. It is legal to use dogs when hunting wild pigs under some circumstances. However, it has been found that using dogs is most effective for locating individuals or smaller groups of wild pigs. In some cases, a female pig is trapped, spayed, fitted with a radio collar, and then released. Since female pigs live in groups, the spayed female pig will lead wildlife managers to local pig populations, which can assist population control efforts. Chemical Control There are no toxicants currently registered for use on wild pigs in the United States and there are no known effective repellents. Further, there are no oral contraceptives approved for use with wild pigs. Eradication Any eradication efforts should be approached with careful planning and forethought. Eradication efforts are expensive and time consuming; however, they can be successful by implementing multiple control methods. There are two examples of wild pig eradication documented in California. One example comes from Santa Cruz Island where wild pigs were eradicated in 2007 at a total cost of about $5 million. Eradication took about 26 months and 5,036 wild pigs were shot on the 62,000 acre island. Wild pigs were also eradicated from Pinnacles National Monument (now Pinnacles National Park) at a total cost of over $600,000 dollars for 200 wild pigs. This number does not include the approximate $2 million that was spent to install an exclusionary fence to prevent wild pigs from recolonizing the monument. The cost of maintaining the fence is over $50,000 annually. Obviously, eradicating or even lowering a wild pig population to an acceptable level is quite expensive, difficult to achieve, and difficult to maintain. It should be noted that assistance in wild pig removal can often be obtained from USDA/APHIS/Wildlife Services and some County Agricultural Commissioner’s offices. Contact your local County Agricultural Commissioner’s office for more details.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74126.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Pesticides are designed to be toxic to the pests they target—whether they are insects, cause plant disease, or are weeds or other unwanted home and garden invaders. When used properly, pesticides can protect your plants or home from damage. However, when the label instructions are not followed correctly, plant injury may occur, pests may not be controlled, health may be impaired, and pesticides may contribute to soil, air, or water pollution. Before you purchase and use a pesticide, learn all you can about the material, how to use it, and how to properly dispose of the empty containers. Also, carefully consider whether or not a pesticide is necessary and if a nonchemical solution might be just as effective. DEFINITION OF A PESTICIDE A pesticide is any material (natural, organic, or synthetic) used to control, prevent, kill, suppress, or repel pests. \"Pesticide\" is a broad term that includes insecticides (insect killers), herbicides (weed or plant killers), fungicides (fungus killers), rodenticides (rodent killers), growth regulators, and other materials like miticides, which are used for mite control, or products that kill snails and slugs (molluscicides). DECIDING TO USE A PESTICIDE Before using any pesticide, be sure you need it. Verify that the organism you seek to control is really causing lasting damage, and research alternative management methods. Keep in mind that most pests cannot be entirely eliminated—even with pesticides. Some questions to ask before choosing to use a pesticide include: Is a pest really the cause of your problem? More often than most people imagine, pesticide products are applied unnecessarily because the cause of damage has been misidentified. Damage can also be the result of other factors such as incorrect irrigation, poor drainage, herbicide toxicity, or physical damage. How many pests are there and will a pesticide spray be justified? A few caterpillars on a plant might not be a problem that requires any pesticide action on your part, especially if natural enemies of the caterpillars are present. However, a very high population causing severe leaf loss or damage to edible fruits or nuts may mean you would want to control the pest. Be sure to base decisions on presence of pests—not damage levels—and on your knowledge of the pest's life cycle. For instance, often by the time a tree is defoliated (stripped of leaves), pests are gone and sprays will be of no use. In the case of foliar diseases, many fungicides must be applied preventatively before symptoms are noticeable. Can you change the conditions which have caused the pest to become a problem? Prevention is always the best way to manage a pest problem. Will the conditions change due to the weather or other environmental factors? Is the problem due to gardening practices that can be changed? Each specific pest organism has optimum environmental conditions for causing damage. For instance, powdery mildew in many plants is favored by shade and conditions that favor off-season growth. Sometimes providing plants with a sunny location, opening up canopies to provide air circulation, and avoiding excessive fertilizing will keep the disease from becoming serious. Overhead sprinkling may also reduce powdery mildew problems on some plants. Other than a pesticide, what else might work? There are many ways to manage pests other than pesticides including:\tCultural control (using the right pruning, fertilizing or watering regime, or selecting pest-resistant varieties or species)\tPhysical control (for example, using mulches to keep weeds from growing, or solarization for soilborne pathogens or weed seeds)\tMechanical control (hoeing weeds, spraying leaves forcefully with water to remove insects, or using traps or creating barriers to exclude pests)\tBiological control (using beneficial organisms such as insects that eat or parasitize other insects)\tReplant (in extreme cases, where a plant requires regular pesticide treatment, consider replanting with a more pest-resistant species or variety)\tIf you decide to use a pesticide, use it in an integrated pest management (IPM) program that includes use of nonchemical methods. In almost all cases, a combination of measures will provide the most satisfactory and long-term pest control. CHOOSING THE RIGHT PESTICIDE The first step in choosing a pesticide is to accurately identify the organism (e.g., the specific insect, weed, or plant disease) that is causing the problem. If the pest is misidentified, you will not be able to choose an effective pesticide or other management strategy. If you aren't confident that you can do this using your own experience, get help from your University of California Cooperative Extension office or other reliable source. Use the plant problem-solving tables in the back of University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources publications, Pests of the Garden and Small Farm and Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs to identify major pests on most common garden plants. If a pesticide is needed, select one that is effective against your pest and also poses the least risks to human health and the environment. A good source of information for identifying effective, least-toxic methods and pesticides for use against specific pests is the University of California (UC) Pest Notes series available at UC Cooperative Extension offices or on the UC Statewide IPM Program Web site. When shopping for a pesticide, it is important to consult the label to be sure the target pest and site is listed. However, don't use a label as your primary source for selecting the best control product. In addition to pests that are effectively controlled, pesticide labels often picture or list pests against which the product is only marginally effective. Getting information from University publications, UC Cooperative Extension offices, or other knowledgeable experts is a better strategy. Before purchasing a pesticide, also check the label to be sure it is appropriate to use on your plants or treatment site. For instance:\tBe sure the particular type of plant or site you plan to treat is listed on the label.\tDo not use pesticides labeled for use on ornamental plants or plants that will be eaten.\tNever use pesticides labeled for \"outdoor use only\" indoors.\tPesticides can seriously damage some plants; read the label to be sure treated plants won't be injured.\tFinally, when choosing pesticides, remember that most pesticides (even the more toxic ones) only control certain stages of the pest. Many insecticides kill only the larval (e.g., caterpillars) stage, not the eggs or pupae. Other insecticides target only adults. Many fungicides are preventive treatments and will not eliminate infections that have already started, although they may slow their spread. Likewise, some herbicides (preemergence herbicides) kill germinating weeds but not established ones, while others (postemergence herbicides) are effective against actively growing weeds. Always Read the Pesticide Label Important information regarding the pesticide can be found on the product's label. The label is a legal document required for every pesticide registered in the United States. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency must approve the label. Always keep the product in the original package. Some of the information that is contained on the label includes:\tTrade name or brand name\tActive ingredients and their percentage by weight\tTypes of plants or sites where pesticide may be used\tPests targeted\tHow much to use\tHow and when to apply\tRequired protective clothing and equipment\tSignal word defining short-term toxicity to people (DANGER, WARNING, or CAUTION)\tPrecautionary statements defining hazards to people, domestic animals, or the environment\tEmergency and first aid measures to take if someone has been exposed\tHow to properly store and dispose of the pesticide and empty containers\tLEAST-TOXIC ALTERNATIVES Choose the least-toxic pesticide that will solve your problem. Least-toxic alternatives are usually suggested in the UC IPM Pest Notes. Examples of least-toxic insecticides include insecticidal petroleum or plant-based oils, soaps, and the microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis . Pesticides are used because they kill or control the target pest. \"Selective\" pesticides kill only a few closely related organisms. Others are broader spectrum, killing a range of pests but also nontarget organisms. Most pesticides are not without some negative impacts on the environment. For instance, some insecticides with low toxicity to people may have high toxicity to beneficial insects like parasitic wasps or other desirable organisms like honey bees, earthworms, or aquatic invertebrates. Most herbicides selectively kill some weeds, but can also kill desirable garden plants if not used properly. Pesticide persistence—or how long it remains toxic in the environment—is also a factor in the safety of pesticides. Pesticides that break down rapidly usually have less negative impact on the environment, but are more difficult to use. Because they don't leave toxic residues that will kill pests arriving hours or days after the application, they must be applied precisely when the vulnerable stage of the pest is present. The signal words Danger, Warning, or Caution on a pesticide label indicate the immediate toxicity of a single exposure of a product to humans. Over the years, these words have been the consumer's primary guide to relative safety of products. However, signal words do not give an indication of potential for causing chronic problems (e.g., cancer, reproductive problems or other long-term health effects). They also do not reflect potential hazards for wildlife, beneficial insects and many other nontarget organisms. However, most home and garden products are relatively safe and unlikely to cause injury to people if label directions are carefully followed. Precautionary statements on labels give additional information on harmful effects or additional safeguards that should be taken. For more information on hazards of specific pesticides, review the Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) available from the pesticide manufacturer, or see the National Pesticide Information Center, or telephone 800-858-7378. PESTICIDE APPLICATION EQUIPMENT Read the pesticide label carefully and be sure that you have the proper equipment for applying it safely. You will need protective clothing to protect yourself from exposure even when applying the safest pesticides. Minimally, protective gear should include rubber gloves, eye protection, a long-sleeved shirt, long pants, and closed shoes. Avoid using cotton gloves or lightweight dust masks that may absorb the spray and result in prolonged contact with your skin. Read the pesticide label carefully for additional protective requirements. Required equipment varies according to your application site, your choice of pesticide, and your willingness to work with more complicated application devices. For many home and garden pesticide applications, the best choice is to purchase a ready-to-use product in a trigger pump type of sprayer. Ready-to-use products eliminate the need to dilute and mix pesticides or purchase special equipment and are excellent for spot treatments on small plants and shrubs. At the other end of the spectrum are compressed air sprayers, which require careful maintenance and operation as well as precise mixing of chemicals. If you mix your own pesticides, keep a set of measuring spoons or cups for use only with pesticides. It is a good idea to write \"PESTICIDE ONLY\" on them to distinguish them from your kitchen utensils, and keep them well away from food preparation areas. A locked storage cabinet in a garden shed, garage, or well-ventilated utility area is the best place to store pesticides and equipment you use to mix or apply pesticides. If you are spraying for weed control, keep a sprayer specifically for that purpose and label it \"WEEDS ONLY.\" Otherwise, herbicide residue in the sprayer may injure plants if the same sprayer is used for applying another type of pesticide or fertilizer. Take a shower as soon after application as possible. Wash clothing separately from other laundry. Never smoke, drink, eat, or use the bathroom after pesticide application without washing first.\tHow to dilute an herbicide\tFor most herbicides, the application rate is stated in ounces per 100 square feet or 1000 square feet, so you need to know how large an area you are treating in order to determine the amount of product to use. Suppose you are trying to kill weeds in your lawn and the herbicide label states \"use 2 oz. per 1000 square feet.\" After measuring, you find your lawn is only 600 square feet. Therefore, you would use (600 square feet/1000 square feet) X 2 oz. = 0.6 X 2 oz. = 1.2 oz. of herbicide to treat the entire lawn.\tYou also must calculate how much water you need to add to your sprayer. Insecticide and fungicide labels and many herbicide labels tell you how much water to add to dilute your spray. If a certain volume of water is not listed, you can determine how much you need by spraying a small area with the sprayer and a known quantity of clean water. Then divide by the fraction of the area where you plan to apply the herbicide. For example, if you found out that one quart of water covered 100 square feet, you can assume you will need 6 quarts to cover 600 square feet. Mix your 1.2 oz of herbicide in 6 quarts of water.\tMeasuring and Diluting Pesticide Concentrates Properly measuring concentrated formulations of pesticides is essential for their effective and safe use. The application rate for most insecticides and fungicides is given on the label in ounces per gallon of water used in the spray applicator. It is essential that you follow these procedures properly and dilute and apply materials as required. For herbicides and some uses of insecticides and fungicides (such as applications on lawns), the label will indicate the amount of pesticide to use for a given area. In these cases, you'll need to measure the area you are treating to calculate how much to mix up. Remember, if the label specifies a dilution rate, you need to follow the label directions precisely. Before mixing up your pesticide, test out your sprayer with water to assure you will cover the recommended area with the recommended amount of diluted spray. If not, you will need to adjust your application rate accordingly by walking or spraying slower or faster. Insecticide or fungicide directions for fruit or ornamental trees often don't specify areas in square feet to be treated. They often say something such as \"wet plants to dripping point, thoroughly cover both sides of leaves.\" For these applications or for spot treatments, it is also a good idea to test out your sprayer with water to see how much spray you need to cover a fruit or ornamental tree or other area. That way you'll know how much product to mix up. Never use more than what the directions recommend. The pest will not be controlled any faster and you will be wasting the pesticide, your time, and money while potentially causing plant injury and contaminating the environment with excess chemicals. Mix up only as much as you need immediately; don't store leftover pesticide solutions. They may be susceptible to quality changes at high or very low temperatures or by settling out. Minimizing Environmental Contamination Use spot treatments where the pest is most prevalent; avoid widespread applications of the pesticide throughout your garden or home. For spot treatments, mix the pesticide according to label instructions, and apply the mixture only to the affected area. Bait stations for ants, wick or shielded applicators for some herbicides, and tree trunk treatments for certain insects are other ways of limiting environmental exposure. Be sure pesticides are properly applied to the target plant or site and can't move onto other plants or areas. Pesticides can easily move off target with wind. Do not spray during windy conditions when pesticides can be carried into areas where they aren't needed or wanted. Be sure the application does not run off or blow into drains, creeks, or other water bodies so you can prevent contamination of water supplies. Avoid applying chemicals just before irrigation or rainy weather, unless labels specify post-application irrigation. Also avoid applying pesticides to hard surfaces such as sidewalks, driveways, and foundations, because they can easily be washed off and go into storm drains. Follow the guidelines below for protecting environmental quality and keeping pesticides out of our waterways. Keep Pesticides Out of Our Waterways Pesticides applied in the garden can move off target by drifting in the air or washing off into storm drains or creeks. Follow these guidelines:\tBe aware of weather patterns and do not apply pesticides just prior to rainfall or during windy conditions.\tAvoid applying pesticides to hard surfaces such as sidewalks or driveways, where they can easily be washed off.\tCheck pesticide labels for warnings regarding use near bodies of water such as streams, rivers, and lakes.\tNever dispose of pesticides in storm drains, sinks, or toilets.\tUnder no circumstances should pest control equipment be cleaned in a location where rinse water could flow into gutters, storm drains, or open waterways.\tNever apply more than the rate listed on a pesticide label.\tBe aware that some pesticides are more easily carried in surface runoff than others and therefore have a greater potential to move off site during irrigation or storms. The leaching and runoff risks of specific pesticides can be obtained from the UC IPM Web site WaterTox database .\tDisposing of Leftover Pesticides Try to purchase only as much pesticide as you will use in the immediate future. This will eliminate the need to store the unused products. If you can't use up your pesticides in a timely manner, share them with a friend or neighbor who can use them, but always keep these materials in their original containers. Do not use an old soda bottle or anything that could be mistaken for a drink container. People have been poisoned and killed by inadvertently drinking from these containers. Don't dilute more pesticide than you can use right away. Diluted pesticide needs to be applied according to label directions to plants or sites listed on the label and at label rates until the spray tank is empty. Excess diluted pesticide should be disposed of at a household hazardous waste facility. Do not dump excess, unwanted, or old material down the drain, onto the soil, or into open waterways, gutters, storm drains or sewers, or in the trash. The only legal way to dispose of pesticides is to take them to your local household hazardous waste disposal facility. In California, call the California Environmental Hotline (1-800-253-2687) to find the hazardous waste disposal site closest to you, or check the Earth911 website. Empty containers of concentrated home-use pesticides in the possession of a homeowner on his/her property may be disposed of in the trash without rinsing. Empty containers of ready-to-use products may also be disposed of in the trash. Professionals who use concentrated liuquid pesticides must rinse the container three times before disposal. The best time to rinse is when you are using up the last remaining pesticide in the container. Add the remaining pesticide to the sprayer. Add water to the empty pesticide container, put the cap on, swirl the water around the container, and transfer the liquid to the spray tank. Repeat two times. If necessary, add more water to the spray tank to reach the correct concentration. This way, you will have rinsed the bottle three times and used the rinse water to make the pesticide application. Don't pour unused rinse liquid down any drain or sewer or in the trash. Unused rinse liquid is considered hazardous waste and must be disposed of properly at a hazardous waste facility or as suggested above. Indoor Versus Outdoor Pesticides Use only pesticides specifically labeled for indoor use inside the house. Many outdoor pesticides are designed to break down into less toxic substances with ventilation and in the daylight and the rain. Without these conditions the pesticides may linger and cause toxic conditions for humans or pets. Hiring a Pest Control Company If you do not have the time or ability to research your pest problem and safely apply the appropriate material to control it, you may want to hire a pest control service to do the job for you. See the Pest Note: Hiring a Pest Control Company for information on how to select a contractor. Licensed pesticide operators also have access to some products not available in retail stores. Many pest problems, such as termites or management of problems on large trees, require special pesticides or equipment and technical training for most effective management. Although professional services may be expensive, the investment may be worth it to solve a serious problem.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "If you do not have the time or ability to research your pest problem and safely apply the appropriate procedures and materials to control it, you may want to hire a pest control service to do the job for you. A licensed professional also has access to some products not available in retail stores. To be effectively managed, many pest problems, like termites or problems on large trees, require specialized equipment, pesticides, and technical training. Although professional services may seem costly, the investment may be worth it to solve a serious problem. A pest control professional, who practices integrated pest management methods and keeps up-to-date about the latest technologies, can provide you with the safest and most effective management strategies. If toxic chemicals are part of the pest management method, it is often safer for your family to have them handled by a professional. BEFORE HIRING A COMPANY 1. Identify the pest and do some research about how to control it following the steps below.\tIf you are not certain of the pest's identity, take it to your local University of California (UC) Cooperative Extension office or county agricultural commissioner's office. You can look up their local telephone numbers in your telephone directory. Ask their advice about management solutions.\tCheck the online UC Pest Notes for information on managing the pest. Based on this information, determine if management is needed and if it is, whether or not you can safely and effectively address the problem yourself.\tIt may be possible for you to make changes in your landscaping or home design to permanently exclude or reduce pests, and this can eliminate the need for professionals, even for serious pests. Examples would be to take out problem tree species and replace them with pest resistant ones or treat your pets with spot-on treatments for fleas and eliminate the need for treating carpets or outdoor areas for fleas.\tPest management professionals often have access to more effective pesticides or other management tools not available to consumers. If this is the case for your pest, you may want to consider professional help.\tIf repeated applications of a pesticide or procedures such as setting traps for skunks are required, ask yourself whether you have the skills or time to follow through. If not, hire a professional.\tIf toxic chemicals or sophisticated application equipment are required, it is often best to hire a professional.\t2. Obtain recommendations from neighbors, friends, or family about pest control services they have used. Call at least three companies and consider their methods as well as their customer service policy:\tFind out what types of services the company offers. For example, do they provide monthly spray contracts or do they offer an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) approach that includes nonchemical methods?\tFind out if least-toxic alternatives are available to control the pest. Ask the company if these least-toxic pesticides or baits are used when appropriate. For example, confirm that exclusion methods, baits, and traps are employed against cockroaches (rather than sprays) and that baits (rather than sprays) are used for ants. For other examples of least toxic approaches, look at the UC Pest Notes .\tMake sure the company has the required licenses, registration, certificates, and insurance.\tPest control companies and individuals making household treatments must operate with a license issued by the California State Structural Pest Control Board. Verify the status of a pest control company's license online or telephone 800-737-8188.\tIndividuals operating landscape maintenance or gardening businesses and performing yard pest control must possess a pest control business license and a Qualified Applicator Certificate or a Qualified Applicator License (QAC or QAL) issued by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation. The licensee should carry an identification card with an expiration date. Verify the status of an individual's certificate or a business' license online or telephone 916-445-4038.\n3. Ask the company to inspect the site.\tThe company may charge a fee to do this inspection, but for that fee they should provide you with a written diagnosis of the problem or an identification of the pest. They should show you where the pest is causing the problem and discuss how they plan to control it. The company should also provide you with details regarding the course of treatment(s), the pesticide to be used—if required, the frequency of inspections and treatment, and an estimate of the cost of implementing the treatment plan. They should also provide you with information about the safety of any products they may apply and any precautions you would need to take, such protecting pets and children.\t4. Review the solutions.\tConsider long-term solutions to the problem. A company that practices IPM will suggest modification of the habitat or use of baits and monitoring, rather than just guarantee to spray on a monthly basis or when and if the pest reappears. An IPM program may include pest management strategies like installing screens on windows, adding sweeps on the bottom of doors, or altering when or how you water your yard.\tConsider your chemical tolerance. Ask which pesticides will be used, the active ingredients they contain, and their effects on pets, the environment, and people—especially the elderly, the very young, or persons with environmental sensitivities. Determine if there are specific legal requirements specifying precautions to be taken after application. You may request a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS), which describes chemical qualities, hazards, and safety precautions for each pesticide used. Contact the pest control company and your county agricultural commissioner if you have further questions about pesticides to be used or consult the National Pesticide Information Center online or by telephone 1-800-858-7378.\tAsk how any pesticides will be applied and where. Chemicals sprayed around the home perimeter may be washed away by irrigation or rain, especially if concrete walkways or other water-repelling materials surround the home. Avoid this type of spraying as it is considered ineffective, costly, and may cause contamination of our waterways or drinking water.\tAvoid companies that offer only calendar chemical treatments featuring automatic monthly or quarterly perimeter sprays. This may or may not be necessary, as the pest may or may not be present at the time of application, and it is not an integrated or long-term pest management approach. Some approaches such as baiting for termites, do require regular monitoring and refilling of bait stations.\t5. Review the contract. The company should present information on the identified pest problem, the reasons behind a chosen treatment and the application techniques. A contract should state the following.\tName of the company\tLength of the service\tTreatment plan\tPrice\tGuarantee\tA reputable pest control company should carry both general liability insurance and worker's compensation insurance. Check the back of the contract for additional details, including possible exclusions. Can you or the company cancel the contract without penalty? Is there an arbitration clause or other method to settle a possible dispute? AFTER HIRING A COMPANY 6. Stay in touch with the company to ensure that you are getting the service stated in your contract.\tVerify that the company is monitoring pest populations as agreed in the contract.\tCommunicate to the company the levels of pests that are tolerable as well as intolerable. For example, you may tolerate ants in the landscape, but not inside the home.\tInform the company of any changes in pest populations that you notice between visits.\t7. Do your part to help manage the pest.\tIn most cases, an effective pest management program will require that the customer carry out certain practices to reduce pest problems. These may include cleaning up food sources or areas that harbor pests such as removing woodpiles or debris, fixing plumbing leaks, or repairing structures. If you don't do your part to follow through with these recommendations, the pest management program may fail to solve the problem.\nChecklist for Working with a Pest Control Company\nIdentify the pest and do some research about how to control it.\tIf you decide to hire a professional, obtain recommendations from neighbors, friends, or family about pest control services they have used.\nCall at least three companies and consider their methods as well as their customer service policy.\tFind out what types of services the company offers.\tFind out if least-toxic alternatives are available to control the pest.\tMake sure the company has the required licenses, certificates, and insurance.\nAsk the company to inspect the site.\tReview the solutions.\nConsider long-term solutions to the problem.\tConsider your chemical tolerance.\tAsk how the pesticide will be applied and where.\tAvoid companies that offer automatic monthly or quarterly sprays.\nReview the contract.\tStay in touch with the pest control company.\nVerify that the company, as agreed in the contract, is monitoring pest populations.\tCommunicate to the company the levels of pests that are tolerable.\tInform the company of any changes in pest populations.\nDo your part to help manage the pest.\nClean up food sources.\tFix plumbing leaks, or repair structures.\n",

The secretion is acrid enough to cause nausea and can produce severe burning and temporary blindness if it strikes the eyes.",

    "managementPestNote": "Because rabies is endemic in the skunk population, some city or county health departments assist in the control of skunks by providing trappers to remove them from residential areas. Some private pest control companies will also trap and remove skunks for a fee. The skunk’s tendency to spray their musk-laden spray is sufficient to make them unwelcome visitors, especially in close proximity to homes. However, removing a skunk from a property may not offer a permanent solution if nothing is done to deter other skunks from the property. Several actions can be taken to make gardens, yards, and residences less attractive to skunks. Because they are usually active only at low-light hours and at night, many people never see skunks as they travel through neighborhoods or yards. Barking dogs may be the first apparent sign of their presence, and the odor resulting from a skunk/dog confrontation will provide positive evidence. If skunks repeatedly travel through your yard or garden, sooner or later you will detect a faint skunk odor, even if the skunk has not sprayed. As with raccoons, an occasional visit by a skunk or a family of skunks may not be cause for concern; but if these visits become commonplace, some action is probably warranted. During the breeding season, males frequently spray when fighting over females. The presence of these odors in late winter is a signal that skunks might be nearby and that it could be necessary to take appropriate measures to prevent pregnant females from accessing potential nesting sites underneath buildings and other structures. Habitat Modification The most effective way to make your property less attractive to skunks is by reducing access to food, water, and shelter that the animals need. To reduce food sources, fallen fruit and spilled seed from bird feeders should be removed frequently. Garbage cans should have tight-fitting lids, and food items or table scraps should not be placed in compost bins; use “hot” rather than “cold” compost method to process organic waste. Food placed outdoors for pets should be removed by nightfall. Intentionally feeding a wild skunk, even when done with good intentions, is a harmful practice. The skunk or its young may become dependent on the unnatural food source and lose their fear of people. This increases the chance that an adult or child may be bitten. Also, the skunk may be trapped or killed when it wanders into another yard where it is not welcome. It is also suggested that the management of grubs and other insects in lawns can reduce food for skunks. In theory, this will deter the animal from further digging. If your lawn is infested with insects or grubs, see Pest Notes: Lawn Insects or contact your local University of California Cooperative Extension office. Potential den sites can be limited by cutting back overgrown shrubbery and by stacking firewood tightly, preferably at least 18 inches above the ground. Remove boards, rocks, and debris lying on the ground, as insects that skunks feed on hide under these objects. Also, control mice and rats so that their numbers do not build up and provide an abundant food source for skunks. Exclusion As with many other vertebrate pests, the best solution for skunk problems beneath porches or buildings is to screen or block them out. Close off all potential entrances or openings under houses, garden tool sheds, mobile homes, porches, and decks with 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth. The advantage of using the small mesh is that it will also exclude rats and house mice if installed correctly. Skunks will work hard to get into a desirable denning space, so take care to make fittings good and tight. If there is soil underneath the potential entrances, bury the wire at least 6 inches to discourage skunks from digging under. Once skunks have made their home beneath a building, the problem is a little more difficult because you have to be sure the animals have left before blocking the opening. One way to determine this is to sprinkle a smooth, 1/8-inch thick layer of flour just in front of the point of entrance to form a tracking patch. Examine the tracking patch soon after dark; the presence of footprints will indicate that the animal has left and the opening can be closed. However, blocking the entrance is more problematic if there are several young left behind. If you are not sure that all the skunks beneath a building have left, a one-way, outward-swinging gate can be fashioned that will allow any remaining skunks to leave but not to re-enter. This gate can be constructed from 1/2-inch mesh hardware cloth hinged at the top of the frame and left loose on the other three sides. It must be larger than the opening so that it can only swing outward. Skunks will push it open to leave but will not be able to push it inward to re-enter. This is ineffective, of course, if the kits are not yet mobile; kits not yet able to walk may have to be removed by other means. The placement of one or more floodlights beneath the building facing outward through the skunk’s entry point will often assist in driving them away from a location. Trapping Skunks can be caught with an enclosed cage-type, live-catch trap. Plastic box traps are superior to wire traps because they are completely enclosed, thus reducing the risk of getting sprayed while removing the trapped animal from the site. If a wire live trap is used, cover the back end with an old blanket when setting the trap. The blanket serves two purposes. First, it provides shelter for the skunk. Secondly, it allows the trapper to slowly cover the entire trap once the skunk is captured. Skunks are less stressed when in dark environments and thus are less likely to spray. Be careful when placing the blanket on the back end of the trap so that it does not interfere with the trigger mechanism. Once the trap has been completely covered with the blanket, the trap can be relocated to a carbon dioxide gas chamber for euthanasia. If in a remote area, shooting can also be used to euthanize the trapped skunk. However, skunks usually spray when shot, so shooting may not be the best approach. Note that drowning is not an acceptable or legal form of euthanasia. Once euthanized, skunks can be double-bagged and disposed of in the garbage. Traps can be baited with a variety of foods including sardines, canned cat food, tuna, or bacon. Sweeter foods also work (e.g., peanut butter, apples, melon rinds, marshmallows, doughnuts, etc.) and may be less likely to capture cats. Individuals who have no experience trapping skunks should hire a professional wildlife control operator. Professionals have the experience and all the necessary equipment to trap and dispatch the animal. An experienced trapper is also much less apt to be sprayed, an event to be avoided if at all possible. Skunks cannot be relocated without a permit, and because of the potential for rabies it is unlikely the California Department of Fish and Wildlife will issue one. Other Control Methods Burrow fumigants such as gas or smoke cartridges may be used in rural areas if the burrows used by skunks can be located and are not under or near buildings. They are not generally recommended for use in residential areas because of the risk of fire and penetration of the gas into buildings. These cartridges are ignited and pushed into the skunk’s burrow. The burrow is then sealed off with soil and packed tightly to prevent the toxic and asphyxiating smoke from escaping. Follow the product instructions carefully. In rural areas, where firearms can be used and it is safe to do so, skunks may be shot. Since they may spray in the process, be selective in the location chosen for this control method. There are no registered toxicants for poisoning skunks. Poison baits sold for the control of rodents should never be used in an attempt to remove skunks. The penalty for such pesticide misuse can be substantial, and illegal poisoning usually comes to light as a result of the accidental poisoning of someone’s pet. A few commercial products are available for repelling skunks, but unfortunately they are not very effective. A rag soaked with ordinary household ammonia has been used with some reported success as a home remedy repellent for driving skunks from beneath buildings. However, ammonia and other repellents with a strong odor should not be placed under an occupied building since fumes can enter the interior space, especially if air is drawn from beneath the building by a furnace or climate control system. Odor Removal There are several options for odor removal. The chemical neutroleum-alpha is one of the most useful neutralizers for removing the unpleasant skunk scent on furniture or in buildings, but this material and products containing it are not readily available. There are also other commercial products sold for neutralizing or masking skunk odor. If you cannot find such products easily, contact a professional wildlife control operator who may be able to provide neutroleum-alpha or can tell you where it can be purchased. Do not use neutroleum-alpha on pets or people. If your dog or cat has confronted a skunk, call your veterinarian to determine current recommendations for washing the animal to get rid of skunk odor. A home remedy formulation reported by some to be effective is as follows:\t1 quart 3% hydrogen peroxide\t1/4 cup baking soda\tand 1 teaspoon liquid soap.\tOnce the hydrogen peroxide is mixed with the baking soda the mixture is unstable and generates oxygen and cannot be bottled or stored. Apparently, oxidation changes the chemical composition of skunk scent so that it no longer smells. When the fresh mixture is applied to items contaminated by skunk odor, the smell diminishes quickly. Any leftover mixture should be diluted several fold with water and poured down the drain. Hydrogen peroxide mixtures can be used safely on pets and people as well as on clothing and furniture. However, care should be taken to keep the mixture out of the eyes. Rinse pets thoroughly with water after treatment. Skunk Bites Rabies, an infectious disease caused by a virus, is found in the saliva of infected animals. It affects only mammals and is transmitted most commonly by a bite. People can survive the bite of a rabid animal but only if medical attention is received in time. A physician should promptly attend to ALL skunk bites, no matter how minor; and the local health department should be notified of the incident. Skunks that seem tame or listless and wander about in an unusual manner during daylight hours should be treated with great caution because this behavior is symptomatic of rabies. Also, if they exhibit no fear of people or pets and show some aggressive behavior, chances are quite high that they are rabid. If you live in an area where skunks occur, be sure your dogs and cats are routinely vaccinated against rabies. Some dogs will confront skunks whenever they get an opportunity. Even though they suffer when they get sprayed, some dogs never learn. People with a high risk of occupational exposure to rabies should also consult with their physician about the possible benefit of being vaccinated.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The rattlesnake is California’s only native venomous snake. Nine species are found in various areas of the state from below sea level to about 11,000 feet. Their size may vary, and adults of some species may reach 6 feet in length. Rattlesnakes are an important part of the ecosystem, feeding on rodents, birds, and other small animals. Rattlesnakes have a distinctive, triangular-shaped head, which can be helpful in their identification; and as their name implies, most have a rattle on the tail end. The harmless gopher snake (Pituophis catenifer) appears similar to rattlesnakes and can alter its posture to mimic the triangular head shape but will always lack a rattle. The rattle lies at the end of the tail and is composed of interlocking horny segments of shed skin. Young rattlesnakes are born with a small rattle or button. A new segment is formed each time the skin is shed, which may occur several times a year. The size of the rattle is only a rough indicator of age because the terminal segments often break off on older snakes. Because rattles can shorten or be broken off completely, the lack of a rattle does not mean the snake is not a rattlesnake. The most widespread rattlesnake in California is the western rattlesnake (Crotalus oreganus), found from the northern part of the state as far south as Santa Barbara County and from sea level to 7,000 feet. Two closely related species (C. helleri and C. lutosus) are found in coastal Southern California and in the northern Sierra Nevada, respectively. The sidewinder (C. cerastes) is the smallest rattlesnake and is so named because of its peculiar method of sideways locomotion. The sidewinder is sometimes called the horned rattler because of the hornlike scales above its eyes. It is most commonly found in sandy desert areas from below sea level to 6,000 feet. The Mohave rattlesnake (C. scutulatus) ranges across the desert and foothills of southeastern California from sea level to higher elevations. The southwestern speckled rattlesnake (C. mitchellii) ranges from Baja California northward across much of the Colorado, Mojave, and Sonoran Deserts, overlapping with the red diamond rattlesnake (C. ruber) in western parts of its range and the sidewinder farther east. The Panamint rattlesnake (C. stephensi) is closely related but has a more northerly distribution in the inland desert regions of Southern California. The red diamond rattlesnake is found in Baja California and in southwestern California south of Los Angeles. The western diamond-backed rattlesnake (C. atrox) is seldom seen in California but occurs in the extreme southeastern part of the state in desert regions. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Most rattlesnakes forage for prey in or near brushy or tall grass areas, rock outcrops, rodent burrows, around and under surface objects, and sometimes in the open. Adults eat live prey, primarily rodents; the young consume mostly lizards and young rodents. To catch their prey, rattlesnakes wait until a prey animal is nearby. The snake strikes with two large fangs that inject venom. This subdues and usually kills the prey, which is then swallowed whole. Rattlesnakes feed on carrion less frequently. When inactive, most rattlesnakes seek cover in crevices of rocks, under surface objects, beneath dense vegetation, and in rodent burrows. In some areas, rattlesnakes hibernate for several months in the crevices of rock accumulations. Unlike many reptiles, rattlesnakes give birth to live young. Newborn snakes require protection for 1-2 weeks and are likely to be born in abandoned rodent burrows, rock crevices, or in other secluded places. Rattlesnakes are among the group of snakes called pit vipers because of the small pits on each side of the head between the eye and nostril. These pits are temperature-sensitive structures that assist the snake in finding prey, even in complete darkness. The tongue is also used to detect the scent of prey. Rattlesnakes have a specialized venom delivery system. Venom is produced in glands behind the eyes and then flows through ducts to the hollow fangs. Normally the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and when a snake strikes, the fangs pivot forward to inject venom. Rattlesnakes may occasionally bite without injecting venom, often called a ‘dry’ bite. However, even after its death, a rattlesnake can still inject venom for an hour or more by reflex action. Caution, therefore, is advised when handling what appears to be a dead snake. Snake Bites In the United States, about 1,000 rattlesnake bites are reported annually, although typically fewer than 4 people die from these bites in a given year. Although seldom fatal, bites can be extremely painful and can lead to severe tissue loss and medical trauma. It is important to never handle rattlesnakes, not even dead ones.\tWhat Should I Do for Initial First Aid?\tBecause most Californians live in rattlesnake country, a snakebite emergency plan should be developed before it is needed. If you are less than one hour from the nearest emergency room, initial treatment is relatively simple:\nTry to calm the victim.\tGently wash the area with soap and water.\tApply a cold, wet cloth over the bite.\tTransport victim to the nearest emergency facility for further treatment.\tPhone ahead to notify the emergency facility that a snakebite victim is being brought in.\tIf safe to do so, have someone photograph the snake so that identification can be made to aid in treatment.\nWhat should NOT be done after a rattlesnake bite?\tSeveral DON’Ts are very important to remember:\nDON’T apply a tourniquet.\tDON’T pack the bite area in ice.\tDON’T cut the wound with a knife or razor.\tDON’T use your mouth to suck out the venom.\tDON’T let the victim drink alcohol.\tDON’T apply electric shock.\tDON’T use a snakebite kit as these do not work and can cause more damage.\nCall: 1-800-222-1222 any time, any place in California California Poison Control System (http://www.calpoison.org/)\tThose who enjoy hiking should determine first whether rattlesnakes are found in that area and under what conditions they might be encountered; however, rattlesnakes may be very sparse or nonexistent across parts of their range. In addition, they can sometimes be transported into areas outside their normal range, either by humans or by natural mechanisms such as floods. If rattlesnakes are in the area, they will most likely be hidden in rock crevices, under logs, in heavy brush, or in other areas where they are protected, including tall grass; but they can also be found on roads, paths, and other areas where cover is limited. Be careful when moving brush, wood, logs, or other debris. In rattlesnake country, be alert when kneeling down to work in the garden and watch where you step. Since rattlesnakes are often well camouflaged and wait quietly for prey, they can be difficult to see. In the wild, rattlesnakes should be left alone as they present little potential hazard. In fact, more than half of venomous snakebites in the United States occur as a result of a person bothering, handling, or harassing a snake, and approximately half of snakebite patients report ingesting alcohol prior to being bitten. Thus, it would seem that one of the key ways to avoid being bitten is to avoid harassing venomous snakes, especially if you are under the influence of alcohol. However, rattlesnakes can still present some risk even if they are not being pestered. For many people, having them around the home or garden is not acceptable. Fortunately, there are ways to minimize potential hazards. LEGAL STATUS The nine species of rattlesnakes found in California are not considered endangered or threatened. California Department of Fish and Wildlife Code classifies rattlesnakes as native reptiles. California residents can take most rattlesnake species on private lands in any legal manner without a license or permit, although a bag limit of two still applies. Additionally, the red diamond rattlesnake (C. ruber) is prohibited from being taken or killed by state wildlife regulation.\tWhat Can be Done to Prevent a Bite?\tHands, feet, and ankles are the most common sites for rattlesnake bites. Using some common sense rules can prevent most snake bites.\nNever go barefoot or wear sandals when walking in areas where you cannot clearly see where you are placing your feet. Always wear hiking boots.\tAlways stay on paths. Avoid tall grass, weeds, and heavy undebrush where snakes may be present.\tAlways look for concealed snakes before picking up rocks, sticks, or firewood.\tAlways check carefully around stumps or logs before sitting.\tWhen climbing, always look before putting your hands in a new location. Snakes can climb walls, trees, and rocks and are frequently found at high altitudes.\tNever grab what appear to be sticks or branches while swimming; rattlesnakes are excellent swimmers.\tBaby rattlesnakes are venomous! They can and do bite. Leave them alone.\tNever hike alone. Always have a buddy to help in case of an emergency. Learn basic lifesaving skills.\tNever handle freshly killed snakes. You may still be bitten.\tNever tease a snake to see how far it can strike. You can be several feet from the snake and still be within striking distance.\tDon’t keep rattlesnakes as pets. Many rattlesnake bites occur when people tease or play with their “pet” rattlesnake.\tTeach children to respect snakes and to leave them alone. Curious children who pick up snakes are frequently bitten.\tAlways give snakes the right of way!\t",

    "managementPestNote": "Rattlesnakes add to the diversity of our wildlife and are important members of our ecosystem. They can reduce the number of disease carrying rodents and other pest species. In general, they should be left alone, whenever possible, especially in wildland areas. Nonvenomous snakes should also be left alone wherever found. Because of the danger rattlesnakes pose to people, pets, and domestic animals, it can be necessary to exclude or remove them from around homes and gardens. It is difficult to detect rattlesnakes because they are not easy to see or to find in their hiding places. Be alert to the potential for their presence during the times of year when rattlesnakes are generally active in your region. If rattlesnakes become exceptionally numerous in an area, sightings by neighbors may alert you to expect a problem. Snake populations may fluctuate from year to year; this is thought to be related in part to the availability of prey. Some animals, such as peacocks, turkeys, and dogs, can be good sentinels for detecting rattlesnakes. If your dog behaves in an unusual manner, such as excessively barking or whining, it would be wise to investigate for the presence of a snake. A veterinarian should immediately attend to dogs or domestic animals bitten by a rattlesnake. If you have a snake-proof fence, be sure to check its integrity prior to the time when snakes become active in the late winter or early spring. Remember that keeping the rodent population in and around your yard under control is an excellent way to discourage snakes of all kinds. Habitat Modification One of the best ways to discourage rattlesnakes from inhabiting gardens and homes is to remove suitable hiding places. Heavy brush, tall grass, rocks, logs, rotten stumps, lumber piles, and other places of cover should be cleaned up. Keep weeds mowed close to the ground or remove them completely. Since snakes are often attracted to areas in search of prey, eliminating rodent populations, especially ground squirrels, meadow voles, deer mice, rats, and house mice, is an important step in making an area less attractive for snakes. Rattlesnakes cannot dig burrows but will use those dug by rodents. After controlling rodents, fill in all burrows with soil or sod and pack down firmly. Exclusion Rattlesnakes may seek refuge beneath buildings. If there is a gap or opening, they will enter and inhabit a building, just as house mice do. Sealing all cracks and other openings greater than 1/4inch can prevent them from entering. Gaps beneath garage doors are often large enough to permit snakes to enter, especially young ones. In summer, rattlesnakes may be attracted to cool and/or damp places, such as beneath buildings and in basements. Access doors on crawl spaces should be inspected carefully for breaks or gaps. Use caution if you must crawl under a house or other building. Hot tub or swimming pool pump enclosures may provide cover if they are not well sealed. The dampness associated with ornamental water fountains, pools, and fishponds may also make the surrounding area attractive to snakes. Fences Snakes can be excluded from an area by installing a snake-proof fence. While expensive, fences are often necessary for children’s play areas. Be sure to make gates tight fitting and keep vegetation and debris from collecting around the fence. Snakes can climb accumulated vegetation and gain access to the top of the fence. Check the fence frequently to be sure it has not been damaged in any way. Repellents Over the years various home remedies have been suggested to repel snakes, such as placing a horsehair rope around your sleeping bag, sprinkling sulfur dust, or scattering mothballs around the area to be protected. Unfortunately, none of these remedies work. Despite what you may hear, there are no plants that repel snakes. Currently, several commercially available chemical snake repellents are on the market, but none of them have been proven to work well enough to warrant recommendation. Biological Control Several predators feed on rattlesnakes, including the kingsnake, which swallows them whole. Unfortunately, the number of rattlesnakes eaten by predators is insignificant in reducing the problem you might encounter around your home or garden. For this reason, relocating kingsnakes to your property is not recommended. Other Control Methods Remember, if left alone, a snake is likely to move on to another area. Also recall that most rattlesnake bites occur when inexperienced people try to pick up, pester, move, or kill a rattlesnake. If you would prefer the snake be removed, it is best to call a professional pest or wildlife control operator who specializes in snake removal. Your local county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension office may be able to direct you to professionals who remove rattlesnakes. A final course of action may be to kill the rattlesnake. However, this option is not generally recommended since rattlesnakes only bite in self defense and attempting to kill them can, and sometimes does, result in a person getting bitten. Even a dead rattlesnake can have a bite reflex and is capable of delivering venom. Rattlesnakes are natural and important predators and automatic killing of them is not recommended any more than is the automatic killing of coyotes, mountain lions, or bears, all of which can very rarely harm people.

Both rat species cause problems by gnawing on electrical wires and wooden structures such as doors, ledges, corners, and wall material, and they tear up insulation in walls and ceilings for nesting. Norway rats can undermine building foundations and slabs with their burrowing activities and can gnaw on all types of materials, including soft metals such as copper and lead, as well as plastic and wood. If roof rats are living in the attic of a residence, they can cause considerable damage with their gnawing and nest-building activities. They also damage garden crops and ornamental plantings. Among the diseases rats can transmit to humans or livestock are murine typhus, leptospirosis, salmonellosis (food poisoning), and ratbite fever. Plague is a disease that both roof and Norway rats can carry, but in California it is more commonly associated with ground squirrels, chipmunks, and native woodrats.",
    "managementPestNote": "A successful rat control strategy typically includes three elements: sanitation measures; building construction and rodent proofing; and, if necessary, population control. Sanitation Sanitation is fundamental to rat control and must be continuous. If sanitation measures aren’t properly maintained, the benefits of other measures will be lost and rats will quickly return. Good housekeeping in and around buildings will reduce available shelter and food sources for Norway rats and, to some extent, roof rats. Neat, off-the-ground storage of pipes, lumber, firewood, crates, boxes, gardening equipment, and other household goods will help reduce the suitability of the area for rats and also will make their detection easier. Collect garbage, trash, and garden debris frequently, and ensure all garbage receptacles have tight-fitting covers. Where dogs are kept and fed outdoors, rats can become a problem if there is a ready supply of dog food. Feed your pet only the amount of food it will eat at a feeding, and store pet food in rodent-proof containers. For roof rats in particular, thinning dense vegetation will make the habitat less desirable. Climbing hedges such as Algerian or English ivy, star jasmine, and honeysuckle on fences or buildings are conducive to roof rat infestations and should be thinned or removed if possible, as should overhanging tree limbs within 3 feet of the roof. Separate the canopy of densely growing plants such as pyracantha and juniper from one another and from buildings by a distance of 2 feet or more to make it more difficult for rats to move between them. Building Construction and Rodent Proofing The most successful and long-lasting form of rat control in structures is exclusion, or “building them out.” (See Rodent-proofing your home.) Seal cracks and openings in building foundations and any openings for water pipes, electric wires, sewer pipes, drain spouts, and vents. No hole larger than 1/4 inch should be left unsealed, in order to exclude both rats and house mice. Make sure doors, windows, and screens fit tightly. Their edges can be covered with sheet metal if gnawing is a problem. Coarse steel wool, wire screen, and lightweight sheet metal are excellent materials for plugging gaps and holes. Norway and roof rats are likely to gnaw away plastic sheeting, wood, caulking, and other less sturdy materials. Because rats and house mice are excellent climbers, openings above ground level must also be plugged. Rodent proofing against roof rats, because of their greater climbing ability, usually requires more time to find entry points than for Norway rats. Roof rats often enter buildings at the roofline, so be sure that all access points in the roof are sealed. If roof rats are traveling on overhead utility wires, contact a pest control professional or the utility company for information and assistance with measures that can be taken to prevent this. Population Control When food, water, and shelter are available, rat populations can increase quickly. While the most permanent form of control is to limit food, water, shelter, and access to buildings, direct population control often is necessary.\tRodent-proofing your home\nRepair or replace damaged ventilation screen around the foundation and under the eaves.\tProvide a tight-fitting cover for the crawl space.\tSeal all openings around pipes, cables, and wires that enter through walls or the foundation.\tBe sure all windows that can be opened are screened and that the screens are in good condition.\tCover all chimneys with a spark arrester.\tMake sure internal screens on roof and attic air vents are in good repair.\tCover rooftop plumbing vent pipes in excess of 2 inches in diameter with screens over their tops.\tMake sure all exterior doors are tight fitting and weatherproofed at the bottom.\nFor controlling rats indoors, using traps is best. When rodenticides (toxic baits) are used in structures, rats can die in inaccessible locations such as within walls or ceilings. In hot weather, the stench of a dead rat can be unbearable and can necessitate cutting a hole in the wall to remove the carcass. Also, ectoparasites such as fleas and mites often leave dead rat carcasses and can infest the entire house if the carcass isn’t removed promptly. Trapping Trapping is the safest and most effective method for controlling rats in and around homes, garages, and other structures. Because snap traps can be used over and over, trapping is less costly than poison baits but more labor intensive. Traps can be set and left indefinitely in areas such as attics where rats have been a problem in the past. The simple, wooden rat-size snap trap is the least expensive option, but some people prefer the newer plastic, single-kill rat traps, because they are easier to set and to clean. Snap traps with large plastic treadles are especially effective, but finding the best locations to set traps is often more important than what type of trap is used. Generally, young rats can’t be trapped until they are about a month old, which is when they leave the nest to venture out for food. Nutmeats, dried fruit, bacon, or a piece of kibbled pet food can be an attractive bait for traps. Fasten the bait securely to the trigger of the trap with light string, thread, or fine wire so the rodent will spring the trap when attempting to remove the food. Even glue can be used to secure the bait to the trigger. Soft baits such as peanut butter and cheese can be used, but rats sometimes take soft baits without setting off the trap. Set traps so the trigger is sensitive and will spring easily. The best places to set traps are in secluded areas where rats are likely to travel and seek shelter. Droppings, gnawings, and damage indicate the presence of rodents, and areas where such evidence is found usually are the best places to set traps, especially when these areas are located between their shelter and food sources. Place traps in natural travel ways, such as along walls, so the rodents will pass directly over the trigger of the trap. For Norway rats, set traps close to walls, behind objects, in dark corners, and in places where rat signs, such as droppings, have been seen. Position traps along a wall so that they extend from the wall at right angles, with the trigger end nearly touching the wall. If traps are set parallel to the wall, they should be set in pairs to intercept rodents traveling from either direction. For roof rats, the best places for traps are off the ground in locations where rats might be coming down from their nests to find food—such as on ledges, shelves, branches, fences, pipes, or overhead beams —where they can be fastened with screws or wire. In homes, the attic and garage rafters close to the infestation are good trapping sites. In areas where children, pets, or birds might contact traps, place the trap in a box or use a barrier to keep them away.\nPets and rat control\tMany of the methods and materials used to control rats can affect pets as well. All rodent baits are toxic to dogs and cats, so be cautious when using these products. Because anticoagulants are cumulative and slow acting to various degrees, depending on whether it is multiple or single feeding, dead rats can contain several lethal doses of toxicant, and secondary poisoning of pets and wildlife is possible if they eat several rat carcasses over a few days. While this secondary poisoning is possible, it isn’t common with the first-generation anticoagulants. Most fatalities in pets involve dogs and are due to the animal eating the bait directly (primary poisoning) or a combination of direct bait consumption and secondary poisoning. Concerns about both primary and second hazards of second-generation anticoagulant baits led the EPA to restrict their retail sale in mid-2011, making them available only to agricultural users and professional pest control personnel. When such baits are in use, extra caution is needed, as exposure to even a single dead rodent might be enough to poison a pet.\tThe best precaution is to keep pets away from bait and dead or dying rodents. Dispose of dead rodents by burying them or by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and putting them in the trash. Do not handle them with bare hands. Read all label directions on the bait and place it only in areas that are specified on the label. Put bait in locations out of the reach of children, pets, domestic animals, and nontarget wildlife or in tamper-resistant bait stations as required by the product label. In many cases, bait stations must be resistant to destruction by dogs and by children younger than 6 years old and must be constructed in a manner that prevents a child from reaching into the bait compartments and getting the bait. If bait can be shaken from stations when lifted or tipped, stations must be secured or otherwise immobilized. As you would with any poison, take care to ensure safety to children and pets by limiting their access to the bait. Clearly label all bait stations with appropriate warnings, and store unused bait in a locked cabinet or another area inaccessible to children and domestic animals.\tUse as many traps as are practical so trapping time will be short and decisive. A dozen or more traps for a heavily infested home might be necessary. Place rat traps about 10 to 20 feet apart. If a rat sets off a trap without getting caught, it will be very difficult to catch the rat with a trap again. To reduce the likelihood of “trap shyness,” one strategy is to leave traps baited but unset until the bait has been taken overnight. To avoid using too few traps, if bait it taken from all traps, double the number of baited traps exposed, and keep doing so until some traps remain with bait untaken; then bait and set all traps. Electrocution Traps Traps that kill rats by electrocution (e.g., Rat Zapper or Victor Electronic traps) are considerably more expensive than other traps, but some homeowners, managers of commercial buildings, and pest control companies have found them to provide good results. As with snap traps, for existing rodent populations it’s important to use enough traps to achieve control in a timely manner. These traps need to be checked frequently, and dead rodents should be removed for disposal. Don’t touch rodents with your bare hands, and wash thoroughly after handling traps. Use disposable gloves to handle dead rodents. Dispose of dead rats by burying them or by placing them in a sealed plastic bag and putting them in the trash. Glue Boards Glue traps, which work on the same principle as flypaper, aren’t recommended for controlling rats, as they are much less effective for rats than for mice. A major drawback with glue boards and other live-catch traps is the trapped rat might not die quickly, and you will need to kill it by delivering a sharp blow to the base of the skull using a sturdy rod or stick. Rats caught in glue traps can struggle for quite some time, often dragging the trap as they try to escape. When used indoors, cats and dogs can get into the glue and track it around the house; outdoors, glue traps can capture lizards, birds, and other nontarget wildlife. Live Traps Live traps aren’t preferred, because trapped rats must be either humanely killed or released elsewhere. Releasing rats outdoors isn’t recommended, as they can cause health concerns to people, pets, and other domestic animals. Because neither the roof rat nor the Norway rat is native to the United States, their presence in the wild is very detrimental to native ecosystems. They have been known to decimate some bird populations. Rodenticides (Toxic Baits) While trapping is generally recommended for controlling rats indoors, when the number of rats around a building is high, you might need to use toxic baits to achieve adequate control, especially if there is a continuous reinfestation from surrounding areas. If this is the case, consider hiring a licensed pest control applicator who is trained to use rodenticides safely. Baits to control rodents are formulated with an attractant (generally food) and a rodenticide (toxin). Changes in rodenticide regulations went into effect in mid-2011 in an effort to prevent rodenticide hazards to wildlife and pets and to reduce accidental exposure to children. These federal EPA restrictions now permit manufacturers to produce, for sale to the general public, only wax block, gel, or paste rat and mouse baits that are packaged in ready-to-use, disposable bait stations. Agricultural producers and professional pest control personnel are able to obtain more types of rodenticides in various formulations, some of which are restricted use pesticides. Anticoagulant Rodenticides Anticoagulants are blood-thinning drugs that cause an animal’s blood to lose the ability to clot, damaging capillaries and resulting in internal bleeding that is fatal. These active ingredients are used at very low levels and the onset of symptoms is delayed for several days, so the rodent doesn’t avoid the bait because of its taste or the onset of illness. When prepared with good-quality cereals and other ingredients, anticoagulant baits provide good to excellent control when baits are fresh and when placed in suitable locations so as to attract rats. The various anticoagulant active ingredients currently registered for use against rats in California are listed in Table 2 . Anticoagulants fall into two groups—the older “first-generation” compounds such as warfarin, chlorophacinone, and diphacinone, which require a rodent to consume multiple doses over a period of several days; and the newer “second-generation” compounds such as brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone, which can be fatal after a single feeding. Since not all rats will consume bait when it first becomes available, bait application directions typically recommend providing an uninterrupted supply of bait for at least 10 or 15 days or until evidence of rodent activity ceases. A rodent feeding on anticoagulant bait usually won’t die until 2 to 6 days following ingestion of a lethal dose. This slow action is a safety advantage, allowing accidental poisoning to be treated before serious illness occurs. The recommended strategy of bait application, which is often needed for optimum rodent control, can result in a rodent ingesting an overdose of the second-generation anticoagulants, which are more effective in part because they persist longer in the rodent’s body than do the first-generation anticoagulants. Thus, they also have the potential to be hazardous to predators and scavengers, which may consume poisoned rodents. This secondary hazard from anticoagulants, as well as the primary hazard of nontarget animals directly ingesting rodent baits, is substantially reduced when baits are applied and used properly, according to label directions.\nTable 2.

The same or similar trade names may be used for products with different active ingredients.\nBecause of the potentially greater hazard of second-generation anticoagulants to children and household pets, these active ingredients are no longer allowed to be manufactured for sale to the general public. Homeowners will be able to purchase only prepackaged, ready-to-use bait stations containing the first-generation anticoagulants (i.e., warfarin, chlorophacinone, or diphacinone) or the nonanticoagulants bromethalin or cholecalciferol. The second-generation anticoagulants (i.e., brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone) have never been approved for use in field situations or for use against ground squirrels, meadow mice (Microtus), pocket gophers, or any other rodents except house mice, Norway rats, and roof rats. Some of the second-generation rodenticides now labeled for use by only by agricultural producers may be restricted to applications in and around agricultural buildings. Anticoagulants have the same effect on nearly all warm-blooded animals, but the sensitivity to these toxicants varies among species with larger animals generally requiring a larger dose of toxicant than smaller animals. Dogs are more susceptible to anticoagulant poisoning than are many other mammals, and small to medium-sized dogs that seek out and consume rodents or rodent carcasses could be at greatest risk. Symptoms of anticoagulant poisoning in mammals include lethargy, loss of color in soft tissues such as the lips and gums, and bleeding from the mouth, nose, or intestinal tract. Vitamin K1 is the antidote for anticoagulant rodenticides, although in cases of severe poisoning, whole blood transfusion is also used. (See Pets and rat control .) Other Rodenticides Three other active ingredients are registered and used as rodenticides to control rats and house mice in California: bromethalin, cholecalciferol, and zinc phosphide. (See Table 3 .) Although not anticoagulants, application directions for bromethalin and cholecalciferol are somewhat similar to those for anticoagulant rodenticides. These two materials are formulated to serve as chronic rodenticides so that rats will have the opportunity to feed on exposed baits one or more times over a period of one to several days. Bait acceptance is generally good when fresh, well-formulated products are used. Zinc phosphide differs in that it is an acute toxicant that causes death of a rodent within several hours after a lethal dose is ingested. Because zinc phosphide baits often require prebaiting to get adequate bait acceptance (offering rats similar but nontoxic bait before applying the zinc phosphide bait), it’s not commonly used against rats and is infrequently available to consumers. An advantage of zinc phosphide bait is its ability to achieve a comparatively quick reduction of a rat population, and for this reason pest control personnel and agricultural producers sometimes favor it. While risk of secondary poisoning to predators and scavengers is low because of the mode of action of these three rodenticides, a primary hazard to nontarget animals (i.e., pets, domestic animals, and wildlife) that may consume rodent baits can occur when required precautions regarding bait placement aren’t followed. Bait Placement and Bait Stations All rodenticide baits must be used carefully according to the label directions, which have become more specific and more restrictive. Some baits must be contained within bait stations for all outdoor, above-ground applications. In addition to increasing the safety of the bait, bait stations also help the rats feel secure while feeding. Place all bait stations in rat travel ways or near their burrows and harborage. Don’t expect rats to go out of their way to find the bait. For Norway rats, place bait stations near rodent burrows or suspected nest sites, against walls, or along travel routes. For roof rats, place baits in elevated locations, such as in the crotch of a tree, on top of a fence, or high in a vine. If you place bait stations above ground level, take care that they are securely fastened and won’t fall to the ground where children or pets could find them. Because rats often are suspicious of new or unfamiliar objects, it might take several days for them to enter and feed in bait stations. Where it is impossible to exclude rodents from structures, rat control can be accomplished by establishing permanent bait stations in buildings and around the perimeters of buildings. Place fresh bait in these stations to control invading rats before populations become established. For best results, make sure there is a continuous supply of bait until feeding stops. With the first-generation anticoagulant baits, it usually takes 5 or more days, once the rats start feeding, for them to die. Check bait stations regularly and replace bait if it gets old or moldy, because rats won’t eat stale bait. Baits and bait stations now have more restrictive regulations regarding locations for use. Different designs of commercially manufactured bait stations may be required, depending on the particular situation and the bait formulation used. For example, some labels state “tamper-resistant bait stations must be used if children, pets, nontarget mammals, or birds may access the bait.” Certain prepackaged bait stations intended for sale to homeowners can be used only inside structures and are prohibited for use in any area accessible to pets or outdoors. Other baits or bait stations may also be used around the periphery of structures or within 50 feet of a structure. Because rats may not travel far from their shelter to find food, many product labels suggest making bait placements at 10- to 30-foot intervals. Place bait boxes next to walls (with the openings close to the wall) or in other places where rats are active. In all cases, the user must follow label directions. Remove and properly dispose of all uneaten bait at the end of a control program. In addition, it’s wise to collect and properly dispose of any dead rodents found during the course of a rodenticide application. You can pick them up using a sturdy plastic bag inverted on your hand, seal them in the bag for disposal with household garbage, or bury them in a location where pets or scavengers won’t easily dig them up. Other Control Methods Rats are wary animals, easily frightened by unfamiliar or strange noises. However, they quickly become accustomed to repeated sounds, making the use of frightening devices—including high frequency and ultrasonic sounds—ineffective for controlling rats in homes and gardens. Rats have an initial aversion to some odors and tastes, but no repellents have been found to solve a rat problem for more than a very short time. There are no truly effective rat repellents registered for use in California. Smoke or gas cartridges are registered and sold for controlling burrowing rodents. When placed into the burrows and ignited, these cartridges produce toxic and suffocating smoke and gases. Because Norway rat burrows can extend beneath a residence and have several open entrances, toxic gases can permeate the dwelling. For this reason and because some fire hazard is associated with their use, smoke and gas cartridges aren’t recommended for rat control around homes. Norway rats can be drowned or flushed from their burrows by flooding them with water from a garden hose and then closing the holes with soil. Predators, especially cats and owls, eat rats and mice. Some house cats don’t have the ability or inclination to prey on adult Norway rats. Often, predators aren’t able to keep rodent numbers below levels that are acceptable to most people. Further, pet food can serve as an attractant and provide a continuous food supply to rats and mice in suburban environments.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Rats are some of the most troublesome and damaging rodents. They eat and contaminate food, garden produce, and fruit, and can transmit diseases to humans and pets. Manage rats by removing food and shelter, eliminating entryways into buildings, and trapping. Indications of a rat infestation: Rat droppings in garages, storage buildings, or attics, or around pet food containers. Rodent feeding damage on tree fruit or nuts in your yard. Rat nests behind boxes, in garage drawers, or in woodpiles. Burrows beneath garbage cans and compost piles or among garden plants. Rats traveling along utility lines or on fence tops at dusk. Is it a Norway rat or a roof rat? The stocky Norway rat builds burrows along building foundations, beneath rubbish, or in woodpiles. Indoors they tend to remain in basements or on the ground floor. Roof rats are agile climbers with a tail longer than their head and body. They usually live and nest above ground in shrubs, trees, or dense vegetation. Indoors they favor attic spaces, walls, false ceilings, and cabinets. To get rid of rats, seal entryways and remove food, water, and shelter. Feed pets only the amount of food they will eat at a single feeding or bring food inside at night. Keep garbage, trash, and garden debris in containers with tight-fitting lids. Thin dense vegetation and create at least a 2-foot space between each shrub as well as between shrubs and buildings. Thin or remove climbing hedges from buildings. Remove tree limbs that are within 3 feet of a roof. Seal all cracks and openings in the house’s foundation that are larger than 1/4 inch. Make sure doors, windows, and screens fit tightly. Remove rats from the home by trapping. Snap traps are the safest, most effective, and most economical way to trap rats. For Norway rats, place traps close to walls, behind objects, in dark corners, and in places where you have found rat droppings. For roof rats, place traps in off-the-ground locations such as ledges, shelves, branches, fences, pipes, or overhead beams. Ensure traps are out of reach of children and pets. What about pesticides? When using rodenticide baits, avoid using them indoors, because dead rats create bad odors. Seal buildings before baiting outside to prevent poisoned rats from coming inside to die. Tamper-proof bait stations are available but can only be used within 50 feet of a building. All rodent baits are toxic to nontarget species, pets, and humans. Always keep away from children and pets.

    "name": "Raccoons",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74116.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "The adult raccoon (Procyon lotor) is a stocky mammal about 2 to 3 feet long and weighs 7 to 30 pounds. It is distinctively marked with a black “mask” over the eyes and is heavily furred with alternating light and dark rings around its tail. Raccoons are active year round but may take cover in dens during periods of severe winter weather. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Raccoons prefer wooded areas near water and natural habitats. They den in hollow trees, ground burrows, brush piles, or rock crevices. This nocturnal animal adapts extremely well to urban and suburban environments, where it often dens in backyards, beneath decks, or in accessible outbuildings. Attics, chimneys, and the spaces beneath houses are also used as dens, if access can be gained. Because they are active mainly at nighttime, raccoons are often present but may go undetected for some time. Raccoons are omnivorous, eating both plants and animals. Plant foods include all kinds of fruits, berries, nuts, acorns, corn, and other types of grain. Animal foods include crayfish, clams, fish, frogs, snails, insects, turtles, rabbits, muskrats, and the eggs and young of ground-nesting birds, including waterfowl. In urban settings, in addition to feeding on backyard fruits, nuts, and vegetables, they scavenge from garbage cans and compost piles. Pet food left outside overnight ranks high as a food resource, and some people intentionally provide food for raccoons. Bird feeders provide another dependable food source for raccoons. Young are generally born in April or May, but earlier and later litters are not uncommon. Litter size ranges from three to six young, averaging about four. Family groups usually remain together for the first year; the year-old young begin to assert their independence the following year when the new litter arrives. Because of the availability of food and den sites, urban and suburban raccoon populations can become very large.",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damagePestNote": "Common problems occur when raccoons look for nesting sites in buildings. Females in search of nesting sites may rip off shingles, fascia boards, or rooftop ventilators to get into the attic. Once inside the attic, insulation on walls may be torn up and displaced; and insulation on heating and air conditioning ducts may be ripped off and destroyed. Raccoons may begin using an area of the attic for a latrine, and the ceiling beneath may become stained with urine, accompanied by an objectionable odor. Ectoparasites may infest the attic and migrate to other parts of the house. Uncapped chimneys are often used as den sites, as are spaces beneath porches and decks. Doors covering crawl spaces are sometimes damaged in an effort to den beneath the house. Raccoon damage to gardens is quite common. Sweet corn is particularly desirable. Raccoons will climb the stalk and tear it down to gain access to the corn. Damage usually occurs right before harvest. Other fruits and vegetables in the garden can also be consumed. Raccoons often will roll up newly laid turf when looking for worms and grubs. However, they do not typically dig holes in lawns when looking for food; if you see conical-shaped holes in your yard, this is likely the result of skunk foraging. For more information on skunks, see Pest Note: Skunks. Raccoons are skilled fishers; as such, they occasionally prey upon koi in backyard ponds. Raccoons are known to carry a number of diseases and internal parasites. The raccoon roundworm, an infection spread to people by the accidental ingestion or inhalation of roundworm eggs from raccoon feces, has caused increased concern in recent years. Roundworm infection can cause serious disabilities, and young children are thought to be most susceptible. Raccoons are also carriers of rabies and distemper. Be sure pets are properly vaccinated to mitigate this threat. LEGAL STATUS In California raccoons are classified as furbearers. The fur harvest season is set by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, which further determines when and how raccoons may be taken. Raccoons causing damage may be taken at any time by legal means. The California Department of Fish and Game Regulations prohibit the relocation of raccoons and other wildlife without written permission of the Department. For further information, contact the Department of Fish and Wildlife.",
    "managementPestNote": "There are various approaches to resolving raccoon problems. In some communities the situation has become so severe that it is beyond the ability of the individual homeowner to solve the problem. In these instances, a community effort may be the only effective solution. City parks, green belts, golf courses, and highway and street plantings may serve as reservoirs for raccoons by providing them with den sites and travel routes. Storm drains and street and road culverts are commonly used as dens. Since these areas are under the control or management of the city, it is often imperative that the city be involved in finding solutions. The city can also invoke and enforce a ban on feeding raccoons, help to educate the public on the best ways to handle an area-wide urban raccoon problem, and discourage individuals from live trapping and relocating animals, which only exacerbates the problem. Detection Raccoons in the garden may be observed at night or they may come up to a sliding glass door and peer inside. Evidence of feeding, tracks, and droppings may provide clues to their visits. Of course, noises on the roof, in the chimney, or in the attic may also indicate their presence. An occasional visit by a raccoon or a family of raccoons may not be a cause for major concern; but if these visits become commonplace and raccoons are also climbing on your roof, some action is probably warranted. Habitat Modification Raccoons are attracted to gardens or homes because they offer a food resource and potential den sites. Efforts to reduce available food can include using metal garbage cans with secure lids. To prevent raccoons from tipping over garbage cans, place the cans in a rack or tie them to a secure post. A bungee cord or wire can also be used to secure lids. Pet food left outdoors should be removed before nightfall to keep raccoons from feeding from pet dishes. Pick up fallen fruits and nuts frequently. Never intentionally provide food for raccoons and discourage your neighbors from this practice as well; it only attracts more raccoons. If possible, remove woodpiles or other materials raccoons can den in or under. Thinning out overgrown shrubbery will reduce cover. To reduce access to the roof, tree branches that overhang rooftops should be cut back; if possible, leaving a gap of at least 5 feet between the roof and the tree. Trellises and arbors attached to homes may facilitate access to the roof and consideration should be given to their removal. While habitat modification is often helpful, it is rarely a total solution. Exclusion Exclusion is the key to eliminating den sites but remember that raccoons are powerful animals and can become vicious when cornered. Their front paws are handlike, with toes that are long, flexible, and considerably dexterous. Raccoons are known to unhook simple latches. Prevent access to chimneys by covering them with a spark arrester that meets the fire code of your area. These caps will keep raccoons, tree squirrels, rats, and birds out of the chimney. The caps should be tightly secured to prevent raccoons from pulling them loose. Be sure that no animals are currently inside the chimney before covering the opening. If raccoons are currently nesting in your chimney, hiring professionals is often the only effective option for removing them. Open spaces beneath structures, such as porches, decks, and garden and tool sheds, should be tightly screened with 10-gauge 1/4- or 1/3-inch galvanized hardware mesh. The bottom edge of the wire should be buried at least 6 inches deep, extended outward for 12 inches, and then back-covered with soil. Such measures will exclude not only raccoons but also skunks, opossums, squirrels, and rats. Ordinary fences will not keep raccoons from gardens or yards, as the animals will either dig under or climb over them. Raccoons readily locate weaknesses in fences and will rip off loose boards or enlarge holes in wire fences for easy access. By exploiting the raccoon’s sensitivity to electric shock, an ordinary fence can be made raccoon-proof by adding a single electrified strand of wire 8 inches above the ground and about 8 inches out from the base of the fence. A pulsating high-voltage, low-amperage fence charger, similar to that used for confining cattle, is used to electrify the fence. Electrified wire wrapped around the trunk of a tree will discourage climbing. A low, two-wire electric fence can be very effective for excluding raccoons from sweet corn, melons, and other highly preferred crops. The two wires are fastened on evenly spaced wooden posts; one wire is 6 inches above the ground and the other is 12 inches above the ground. The fence charger needs to be activated only from dusk to dawn. This type of low electric fence can be installed around a newly laid sod lawn to prevent raccoons from rolling back the new sod in search of insects or grubs. The fence is removed once the turf has taken root. Such fences around ponds are sometimes used to protect koi and goldfish from raccoons. Before installing an electric fence, explore the pros and cons of its use; and, if used, be sure the electric charger is appropriate for the task. Remember that electrified fences are not appropriate for all situations, must be installed properly, and should always be identified with warning signs. Frightening A variety of materials, gadgets, and devices designed to frighten raccoons and other wildlife are on the market. These include flashing lights, sound-producing devices, and water-squirting units, all of which can be activated by motion detectors. In addition, radios, scarecrows, and flags and windmills that spin or flutter in the wind have been used. These devices can be effective for a few days. However, raccoons often quickly learn that there is no threat associated with these devices, at which time they cease to be effective. Repellents There are a few commercial chemical repellents available to repel various forms of wildlife, but none have been effective for raccoons. Mothballs, blood meal, and a wide variety of other home remedies have been tried to no avail, as raccoons are quick to adapt. Trapping For the average homeowner unfamiliar with trapping raccoons, it is advisable to hire a professional wildlife control operator to remove the animal. The professional will have the proper equipment to accomplish the task and will be able to tell if a trapped female is nursing its young. This is very important because you don’t want to leave young behind to starve. The professional will also have the means to euthanize the animals, since releasing them elsewhere is prohibited by law (unless a permit to relocate the raccoon has been obtained from California Department of Fish and Wildlife). Released animals may return or present a problem to someone else; and, in fact, the animal you have trapped may have been deliberately released near you. Release of animals is a major factor in the dissemination of numerous diseases to other animals including pets and humans. Some counties have trapping programs for nuisance animals, including raccoons. Contact your local agricultural commissioner to see if this service is available. Raccoons are fairly easy to trap; however, occasionally a clever and cunning animal will be quite elusive. A live cage-type trap is usually the preferred trap for homeowners, although others are available that may be used by professionals to capture the more difficult animals. The single-door trap should be sturdily constructed and its dimensions should be at least 10 x 12 x 32 inches. Larger 15 x 15 x 36 inch traps are even better. Canned tuna or canned fish-flavored cat food make excellent baits but may also attract nontarget cats and dogs. To avoid catching cats, try using marshmallows, grapes, prunes, peanut butter, or sweet rolls. Small pieces of bait should be placed along a path leading up to the trap. The rear of the trap should be covered with 1/2-inch wire mesh to prevent the raccoon from reaching through the trap from the outside to steal the bait. Traps should be well anchored to the ground or weighted to prevent the animal from tipping the trap over to obtain the bait. Traps should be set at night and closed in the morning to avoid trapping nontargets. Remember, raccoons are intelligent and clever animals. They are also powerful and can be vicious when trapped or cornered. Other Control Methods Dogs kept outdoors may alert you to the presence of raccoons and may frighten some away; however, some raccoons will attack dogs and cause serious injuries. Since they are usually active at night when they are most difficult to see, shooting is rarely the solution to nuisance raccoons. Additionally, most municipalities do not allow the discharge of firearms within their boundaries. However, in rural areas, shooting can sometimes provide an effective solution to a persistent raccoon problem. REFERENCES Salmon, T. P., D. A. Whisson, and R. E. Marsh. 2006.

    "descriptionPestNote": "There are four species of tree squirrels in California (excluding the small nocturnal flying squirrel, which is not considered a pest). Of the four species, two are native and two are introduced from the eastern part of the United States. In their natural habitats they eat a variety of foods, including a wide range of seeds such as pine nuts and acorns, fungi, insects, bird eggs, and young birds. Squirrels can cause damage around homes and gardens, where they feed on a variety of fruits, nuts, and other crops and plants. They can also dig holes in garden soil or in turf, where they bury nuts, acorns, or other seeds. They can be a nuisance around structures by gnawing on telephone cables, chewing their way into wooden buildings, or invading attics. Tree squirrels carry certain diseases that are transmissible to people, and they are frequently infested with fleas, mites, and other ectoparasites. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Tree squirrels are active during the day and are often seen in trees, running on utility lines, and foraging on the ground. Tree squirrels are easily distinguished from ground squirrels and chipmunks by their long bushy tails, their lack of markings (such as spots or stripes), and the fact that they escape by climbing trees and other structures. All are chiefly arboreal, although the fox and western gray squirrels spend considerable time foraging on the ground. Tree squirrels do not hibernate and are active year-round. They are most active in early morning and late afternoon. Eastern fox squirrels (Sciurus niger) Eastern fox squirrels were introduced from the eastern part of the United States and are well established in most major cities of California. Some people enjoy seeing them and have introduced them into new territories. They are often observed in agricultural lands around these same cities. Eastern gray squirrels (Sciurus carolinensis)\tEastern gray squirrels were originally introduced from the eastern United States into Golden Gate Park in San Francisco. They are also established in areas of Calaveras, Sacramento, and San Joaquin counties and may be expanding their range. Western gray squirrels (Sciurus griseus) Native western gray squirrels are found throughout much of California, primarily in oak woodlands of the foothills and valleys and in pine-oak forests, where they feed on a variety of seeds, fungi, and other plant materials. Douglas squirrels (Tamiasciurus douglasii) Native Douglas squirrels, sometimes called chickarees, are found in mostly conifer-forested regions of the north coastal area and along the Sierra Nevada mountain region. Because of the habitat in which they thrive, Douglas squirrels are not usually large-scale pests. They may, however, become garden or home pests in some of the more remote rural areas.",

    "damagePestNote": "Of the four tree squirrels, the eastern fox squirrel (sometimes called the red squirrel) is by far the most serious pest to homes and gardens in urban and suburban situations. In some cities, eastern fox squirrels have moved outward into agricultural land where they have become a pest of commercial crops. Squirrels sometimes cause damage around homes and gardens, where they feed on immature and mature almonds, English and black walnuts, oranges, avocados, apples, apricots, and a variety of other plants. During ground foraging they may feed on strawberries, tomatoes, corn, and other crops. They also have a habit, mostly in the fall, of digging holes in garden soil or in turf where they bury nuts, acorns, or other seeds. This caching of food, which they may or may not ever retrieve, raises havoc in the garden and tears up a well-groomed lawn. Squirrels sometimes gnaw on telephone cables and may chew their way into wooden buildings or invade attics through gaps or broken vent screens. They also have a tendency to strip bark to feed on the juicy inner bark layer (cambium), causing injury to trees. Tree squirrels carry certain diseases such as tularemia and ringworm that are transmissible to people. They are frequently infested with fleas, mites, and other ectoparasites. LEGAL STATUS Tree squirrels are classified as game mammals by the California Fish and Game Code and can be controlled only as provided by the hunting regulations. However, two exceptions exist for lethal removal of tree squirrels: Eastern fox squirrels Eastern fox squirrels found to be injuring growing crops or other property may be controlled at any time and in any legal manner by the owner or tenant of the premises without a permit. Gray squirrels Any owner or tenant of land or property that is being damaged or destroyed, or is in danger of being damaged or destroyed by gray squirrels, may apply to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) for a permit to control such squirrels. The Department, upon receipt of satisfactory evidence of actual or immediately threatened damage or destruction, may issue a revocable permit for the removal and disposition of such squirrels. When a permit to trap the gray squirrel is issued, the Department may designate the type of trap to be used, and may also require that squirrels be released in parks or other nonagricultural areas. It is not legal to use poison baits to kill any tree squirrel species. Releasing any tree squirrel elsewhere is also illegal unless a proper permit is issued by CDFW.",
    "managementPestNote": "In urban and suburban areas, tree squirrels are difficult to control because of their great mobility, and because many people feed and provide nest boxes for the squirrels in order to encourage their presence. It is relatively easy to keep squirrels out of buildings, but keeping them out of a yard or garden is a continuous challenge. Monitoring The detection of tree squirrels is fairly easy because they are active during daylight hours and are highly visible. If tree squirrels visit your garden or yard on a regular basis, it is likely that damage will occur at certain stages of crop development, particularly with fruit and nut crops. If squirrels are seen in your trees, some kind of preventive action should be taken; squirrels can strip a tree of its crop in a short time. Habitat Modification Trees that overhang roofs or are close to telephone lines should be cut back to slow the movement of squirrels about the yard. Anything that can be done to make a garden less attractive to squirrels is helpful. Exclusion Screening or blocking all potential entrance sites such as small gaps under the eaves, overlapping roof sections, and knotholes, can prevent tree squirrel access to buildings. Because they often travel on overhead telephone lines, power lines, and fence tops, they frequently find entrances at about these heights. When even a small opening is found, they can enlarge it by gnawing. In the absence of an obvious entrance, they can gnaw and create an entrance into an attic. Sheet metal or 1/4–inch wire hardware cloth are suitable materials for closing entrances. When closing entry routes, be sure there is not an animal inside the building. One way to test whether any squirrels are remaining is to plug the entrance with a loose wad of newspaper; if any remain inside they will remove the plug to get out. It is virtually impossible to keep squirrels out of fruit or nut trees because of their superb climbing and jumping ability. Sometimes if there are other unprotected fruit or nut trees available to the squirrels, you can protect the crop of a single tree by netting it as you would to exclude foraging birds. While squirrels can readily gnaw through the plastic netting, they may not persist if enough alternative food is easily available. Squirrels can be discouraged from digging up newly seeded or established crops by covering the rows with cage-like freestanding covers made of one–inch hexagon chicken wire. If squirrels are present around bird feeders, they are usually able to raid them and steal the food. Numerous devices and methods are commercially available from specialty catalogs for physically excluding tree squirrels from feeders; some of these work better than others. Tree squirrels are amazingly clever and agile, so just about any feeder is susceptible. Trapping Several types of kill traps are useful for tree squirrel removal, but they must be set in a way that will not accidentally trap nontarget animals, including pets. This can be accomplished by placing the trap in a tree, on a rooftop, or inside a box or wire cage with entrances no larger than 3 inches in diameter. Remember, only eastern fox squirrels can be killed without a hunting license or permit. All-metal tunnel or tube-type traps are becoming more popular for killing eastern fox squirrels. The design of these traps affords good protection to larger nontarget animals, and the trapped animal remains partially out of sight. The Conibear® #110 trap, a jaw-type body-gripping trap, is also an effective tree squirrel trap when set inside a trap box with the bait placed behind the trap. Several choker-type box traps are sold for removing tree squirrels. They look similar to those used for trapping pocket gophers except that the triggers are often reversed, so that the bait must be pulled to activate instead of pushed, as is the case with pocket gopher traps. In fact, a tree squirrel trap can be made by modifying certain wooden choker-type gopher traps. To modify a gopher trap, lengthen the trigger slot with a rattail file so the trigger can swing unhindered and the squirrel can pass beneath the unset trap. Remove the back and replace it with 1/4–inch mesh hardware cloth, which allows the squirrels to see the bait from both ends but prevents access without passing through the trap. For a dual-trap assembly, place two box traps back-to-back and secure them to a board. Before placing traps, determine the squirrels' travel routes, and locate traps in or as close to them as possible. Trees and rooftops are often good locations for placement. Locate and secure traps so that they cannot be easily dislodged. Anchor them with a wire or light chain so a predator cannot carry the trap and the captured animal away. Bait the traps but do not set them for several days to allow the squirrels to steal the bait and become accustomed to the trap. Once the bait is regularly eaten, set the traps, and rebait, tying the bait to the trigger with fine thread or string. Use rubber, latex, nitrile, or plastic gloves when handling dead squirrels. Place dead squirrels in a plastic bag and seal to confine any ectoparasites (fleas, etc.). The securely bagged carcasses can then be discarded in a garbage can. Sometimes ordinary rat snap-traps are suggested for tree squirrels, but these are often not powerful enough to kill mature squirrels and are best not used. There are other kill traps available for squirrel-sized animals, but these are not always sold locally and may have to be ordered from a trapper supply firm. Live-catch traps. Live-catch cage traps are also available, but once caught the squirrel must be euthanized, presenting a problem for some. Remember, releasing any tree squirrel elsewhere is illegal unless a proper permit is issued by the California Department of Fish and Wildlife beforehand, and the issuance of such a permit is unlikely in most situations. Methods of euthanasia considered humane by the American Veterinary Medical Association include gassing with carbon dioxide and shooting. Drowning is not an approved method of euthanasia and is illegal in California. Considering this problem, live-catch traps are not recommended in many situations. A kill trap is usually the most effective way to thin out the population, though new squirrels will move in to fill the void. Trapping usually becomes an ongoing process, once the neighborhood is populated with tree squirrels. Other Control Methods Although some chemical repellents are registered for use to keep tree squirrels out of an area, their effectiveness is questionable. There are also repellents that are added to birdseed that are supposed to prevent squirrels from feeding on the seeds. However, these, too, have not shown to be effective. Tree squirrels quickly become habituated to frightening devices using visual or sound cues, and pay little attention to them after a couple of days. A number of these devices are on the market, but none have proven very effective. Where shooting is not prohibited and firearms can safely be used, the eastern fox squirrel can be taken (killed) at close range with a pellet gun. Check with local authorities to determine if this method is legal in your area. Tree squirrels are quick to escape when pursued by predators. Some dogs that have full run of the yard will keep squirrels at bay. Predators in urban and suburban areas generally have little effect on tree squirrel populations.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Biological control is the beneficial action of parasites, pathogens, and predators in managing pests and their damage. Biocontrol provided by these living organisms, collectively called “natural enemies,” is especially important for reducing the numbers of pest insects and mites. Use of natural enemies for biological control of rangeland and wildland weeds (e.g., Klamath weed, St. Johnswort) is also effective. Plant pathogens, nematodes, and vertebrates also have many natural enemies, but this biological control is often harder to recognize, less well understood, and/or more difficult to manage. Conservation, augmentation, and classical biological control are tactics for harnessing natural enemies’ benefits. TYPES OF NATURAL ENEMIES Parasites, pathogens, and predators are the primary groups used in biological control of insects and mites (Table 1). Most parasites and pathogens, and many predators, are highly specialized and attack a limited number of closely related pest species. Learn how to recognize natural enemies by consulting resources such as the Natural Enemies Handbook and the Natural Enemies Gallery. Parasites A parasite is an organism that lives and feeds in or on a host. Insect parasites can develop on the inside or outside of the host’s body. Often only the immature stage of the parasite feeds on the host. However, adult females of certain parasites (such as many wasps that attack scales and whiteflies) feed on and kill their hosts, providing an easily overlooked but important source of biological control in addition to the host mortality caused by parasitism. Although the term “parasite” is used here, true parasites (e.g., fleas and ticks) do not typically kill their hosts. Species useful in biological control, and discussed here, kill their hosts; they are more precisely called “parasitoids.” Most parasitic insects are either flies (Order Diptera) or wasps (Order Hymenoptera). Parasitic wasps occur in over three dozen Hymenoptera families. For example, Aphidiinae (a subfamily of Braconidae) attack aphids. Trichogrammatidae parasitize insect eggs. Aphelinidae, Encyrtidae, Eulophidae, and Ichneumonidae are other groups that parasitize insect pests. It’s important to note that these tiny to medium-sized wasps are incapable of stinging people. The most common parasitic flies are the typically hairy Tachinidae . Adult tachinids often resemble house flies. Their larvae are maggots that feed inside the host. Pathogens Natural enemy pathogens are microorganisms including certain bacteria, fungi, nematodes, protozoa, and viruses that can infect and kill the host. Populations of some aphids, caterpillars, mites, and other invertebrates are sometimes drastically reduced by naturally occurring pathogens, usually under conditions such as prolonged high humidity or dense pest populations. In addition to a naturally occurring disease outbreak (epizootic), some beneficial pathogens are commercially available as biological or microbial pesticides. These include Bacillus thuringiensis or Bt, entomopathogenic nematodes, and granulosis viruses. Additionally, some microorganism by-products, such as avermectins and spinosyns are used in certain insecticides; but applying these products is not considered to be biological control. Predators Predators kill and feed on several to many individual prey during their lifetimes. Many species of amphibians, birds, mammals, and reptiles prey extensively on insects. Predatory beetles, flies, lacewings, true bugs (Order Hemiptera), and wasps feed on various pest insects or mites. Most spiders feed entirely on insects. Predatory mites that feed primarily on pest spider mites include Amblyseius spp., Neoseiulus spp., and the western predatory mite, Galendromus occidentalis .\tTable 1.

Carefully observe the mites and insects on your plants to help discern their activity. For example, some people may mistake syrphid fly larvae for caterpillars. However, syrphid fly larvae are found feeding on aphids and not chewing on the plant itself. If you find mites on your plants, observe them with a good hand lens. Predaceous mites appear more active than plant-feeding species. In comparison with pest mites, predaceous mites are often larger and do not occur in large groups. Consult publications listed in the References to learn more about the specific pests and their natural enemies in your gardens and landscapes. Take unfamiliar organisms you find to your local University of California (UC) Cooperative Extension office, UC Master Gardener Program, or agricultural commissioner office in your county for aid in identification. CONSERVATION: PROTECT NATURAL ENEMIES Preserve existing natural enemies by choosing cultural, mechanical, or selective chemical controls that do not harm beneficial species. Remember, only about 1% of all insects and mites are harmful. Most pests are attacked by multiple species of natural enemies (Table 1), and their conservation is the primary way to successfully use biological control. Judicious (e.g., selective, timing) pesticide use, ant control, and habitat manipulation are key conservation strategies. Pesticide Management Biological control’s importance often becomes apparent when broad-spectrum, residual pesticides (those that persist for days or weeks) cause secondary pest outbreaks or pest resurgence. An example is the dramatic increase in spider mite populations (flaring) that sometimes results after applying a carbamate (e.g., carbaryl or Sevin) or organophosphate (malathion) to control caterpillars or other insects. Eliminate or reduce the use of broad-spectrum, persistent pesticides whenever possible. Carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids kill natural enemies that are present at the time of spraying and for days or weeks afterwards their residues kill predators and parasites that migrate in after spraying. Neonicotinoids (e.g., dinetofuran, imidacloprid) and other systemic insecticides that translocate (move) into blossoms can poison natural enemies and honey bees that feed on nectar and pollen. Even if beneficials survive an application, low levels of pesticide residues can interfere with natural enemies’ reproduction and their ability to locate and kill pests. When pesticides are used, apply them in a selective manner. Treat only heavily infested areas with “spot” applications instead of entire plants. Choose insecticides that are more specific in the types of invertebrates they kill, such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) that kills only caterpillars that consume treated foliage. For most other types of exposed-feeding insects, rely on contact insecticides with little or no persistence, including azadirachtin, insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil (horticultural oil), neem oil, and pyrethrins, which are often combined with the synergist piperonyl butoxide. In situations where you wish to foster biological control, use of nonpersistent pesticides can provide better long-term control of the pest because they do less harm to natural enemies that migrate in after the application. To obtain adequate control, thoroughly wet the infested plant parts with spray beginning in spring when pests become abundant. To provide sustained control, repeated application may be needed. For certain harder-to-control pests where contact-only insecticides are inadequate, other choices include spinosad, a fermentation product of a naturally occurring bacterium. This insecticide persists about 1 week and it has translaminar activity (is absorbed short distances into plant tissue). Spinosad can be toxic to certain natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, Trichogramma wasps, and syrphid fly larvae) and bees when sprayed and for about 1−4 days afterwards; do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering.\tRelative toxicity of insecticides to natural enemies.\nTOXICITY TO PARASITES AND PREDATORS 1\nINSECTICIDE\tDirect\tResidual\nmicrobial (Bacillus thuringiensis)\tno\tno\nbotanicals (pyrethrins)\tyes/no 2\nno\noil (horticultural), soap (potash soap)\tyes\tno\nmicrobial (spinosad)\tyes/no 2\nyes/no 2\nneonicotinoids (imidacloprid)\tyes/no 2\nyes\ncarbamates (carbaryl), organophosphates (malathion), pyrethroids (bifenthrin)\tyes\tyes\n1. Direct contact toxicity is killing within several hours from spraying the beneficial or its habitat. Residual toxicity is killing or sublethal effects (such as reduced reproduction or ability to locate and kill pests) due to residues that persist.\t2. Toxicity depends on the specific material and how it is applied and the species and life stage of the natural enemy.\tSee the active ingredients database for more information about specific pesticides.\nAnt Control and Honeydew Producers The Argentine ant and certain other ant species are considered pests primarily because they feed on honeydew produced by insects that suck phloem sap, such as aphids, mealybugs, soft scales, psyllids, and whiteflies. Ants protect honeydew producers from predators and parasites that might otherwise control them. Ants sometimes move these honeydew-producing insects from plant to plant (called “farming”). Where natural enemies are present, if ants are controlled, populations of many pests will gradually (over several generations of pests) be reduced as natural enemies become more abundant. Control methods include cultivating soil around ant nests, encircling trunks with ant barriers of sticky material, and applying insecticide baits near plants. See Pest Notes: Ants for more information. Habitat Manipulation Plant a variety of species that flower at different times to provide natural enemies with nectar, pollen, and shelter throughout the growing season. The adult stage of many insects with predaceous larvae (such as green lacewings and syrphid flies) and many adult parasites feed only on pollen and nectar. Even if pests are abundant for the predaceous and parasitic stages, many beneficials will do poorly unless flowering and nectar-producing plants are available to supplement their diet. To retain predators and parasites, grow diverse plant species well adapted to the local conditions and that tolerate low populations of plant-feeding insects and mites so that some food is always available. Other cultural controls that can help natural enemies include reducing dust and properly fertilizing and irrigating. Dust can interfere with natural enemies and may cause outbreaks of pests such as spider mites. Reduce dust by planting ground covers and windbreaks and hosing off small plants that become excessively covered with dust. Avoid excess fertilization and irrigation, which can cause phloem-feeding pests, such as aphids, to reproduce more rapidly than natural enemies can provide control. AUGMENTATION When resident natural enemies are insufficient, their populations can sometimes be increased (augmented) through the purchase and release of commercially available beneficial species. However, there has been relatively little research on releasing natural enemies in gardens and landscapes. Releases are unlikely to provide satisfactory pest control in most situations. Some marketed natural enemies are not effective. Many natural enemies are generalist predators and are cannibalistic and feed indiscriminately on pest and beneficial species, thereby reducing their effectiveness. Only a few natural enemies can be effectively augmented in gardens and landscapes. For example, entomopathogenic nematodes can be applied to control certain tree-boring and lawn-feeding insects. Convergent lady beetles (Hippodamia convergens) purchased in bulk through mail order, stored in a refrigerator, and released in very large numbers at intervals can temporarily control aphids; however, lady beetles purchased through retail outlets are unlikely to be sufficient in numbers and quality to provide control. Successful augmentation generally requires advanced planning, biological expertise, careful monitoring, optimal release timing, patience, and situations where certain levels of pests and damage can be tolerated. Situations where pests or damage are already abundant are not good opportunities for augmentation. CLASSICAL BIOLOGICAL CONTROL OR IMPORTATION Classical biological control, also called importation, is primarily used against exotic pests that have inadvertently been introduced from elsewhere. Many organisms that are not pests in their native habitat become unusually abundant after colonizing new locations without their natural controls. Researchers go to the pest’s native habitat, study and collect the natural enemies that kill the pest there, then ship promising natural enemies back for testing and possible release. Many insects and some weeds that were widespread pests in California are now partially or completely controlled by introduced natural enemies, except where these natural enemies are disrupted, such as by pesticide applications or honeydew-seeking ants. By law, natural enemy importation must be done only by qualified scientists with government permits. Natural enemies are held and studied in an approved quarantine facility to prevent their escape until research confirms that the natural enemy will have minimal negative impact in the new country of release. It is important for landscape managers to recognize imported natural enemies and conserve them whenever possible. Because classical biological control can provide long-term benefits over a large area and is conducted by agencies and institutions funded through taxes, public support is critical to the continued success of classical biological control. Is Biological Control “Safe”? A great benefit of biological control is its relative safety for human health and the environment, compared to widespread use of broad-spectrum pesticides. Most negative impacts from exotic species have been caused by undesirable organisms contaminating imported goods, by travelers carrying in pest-infested fruit, and from introduced ornamentals that escape cultivation and become weeds. These ill-advised or illegal importations are not part of biological control. Negative impacts have occurred from poorly conceived, quasi-biological control importations of predaceous vertebrates like frogs, mongooses, and certain fish, often conducted by nonscientists. To avoid these problems, biological control researchers follow government quarantine regulations and work mostly with host-specific natural enemies that pose low risks and can provide great benefits. As a pest comes under biological control, population densities decline for both the pest and the biological control agent because host-specific natural enemies cannot prey or reproduce on other species.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Los pesticidas están diseñados para ser tóxicos para las plagas que se busca controlar. Estas plagas pueden ser insectos, organismos que causan enfermedades en las plantas, malezas u otros invasores no deseados del hogar y del jardín. Utilizados correctamente, los pesticidas pueden proteger sus plantas o su hogar. Sin embargo, si no se siguen correctamente las instrucciones de la etiqueta del pesticida, estos productos pueden producir daño a las plantas, no controlar las plagas, poner en riesgo la salud humana y contribuir a la contaminación del suelo, aire y agua. Antes de comprar y aplicar un pesticida, usted debe aprender todo lo que pueda sobre el producto. Hay que entender cómo usarlo y cómo eliminar correctamente los envases vacíos. Además, debe considerar seriamente si es necesario usar un pesticida. Quizás existe una solución igualmente efectiva, sin usar sustancias químicas. DEFINICIÓN DE UN PESTICIDA Un pesticida es cualquier producto (natural, orgánico o sintético) que se usa para controlar, prevenir, eliminar, contener o repeler plagas. La palabra “pesticida” tiene un significado amplio. Incluye insecticidas (para matar insectos), herbicidas (para matar malezas y otras plantas), fungicidas (para matar hongos), rodenticidas (para matar roedores) y reguladores de crecimiento. Además, incluye otros productos tales como acaricidas, que se usan para controlar ácaros, y productos para matar caracoles y babosas (llamados molusquicidas). CÓMO DECIDIR SI SE VA A USAR UN PESTICIDA Antes de usar cualquier pesticida, asegúrese de que realmente lo necesita. Verifique que el organismo que usted busca controlar esté realmente causando un daño importante y duradero. Investigue los métodos alternativos para el manejo de plagas que no requieren el uso de pesticidas. Tenga en cuenta que la mayoría de las plagas no pueden ser eliminadas totalmente, ni siquiera con el uso de pesticidas. Las siguientes son algunas de las preguntas que usted debe considerar antes de elegir un pesticida: ¿Es realmente una plaga la causa del problema? Con más frecuencia de la que imaginamos, los pesticidas se aplican sin necesidad. Esto se debe a que no se identifica correctamente la verdadera causa del daño. El daño puede también deberse a otros factores como: riego incorrecto, drenaje insuficiente, toxicidad de un herbicida, o daño físico. ¿Qué cantidad de plagas hay? ¿Se justifica aplicar un pesticida? La presencia de sólo unas pocas orugas en una planta no necesariamente reqiuere la aplicación de un pesticida, especialmente si están presentes los enemigos naturales de dichas orugas. Sin embargo, una población numerosa de plagas que causando una gran pérdida de hojas o daño a frutos y nueces comestibles puede ser la señal que le indicar que usted necesita controlar la plaga. Debe basar su decisión en la presencia de plagas (no en los niveles de daño), ye en los conocimientos que usted tenga sobre el ciclo de vida de la plaga. Por ejemplo, frecuentemente cuando un árbol ha quedado sin hojas, la plaga ya se ha retirado y las aplicaciones de pesticidas no serán de ninguna utilidad. En el caso de enfermedades foliares, muchos fungicidas se deben aplicar en forma preventiva, antes de que aparezcan los síntomas de dichas enfermedades. ¿Se pueden cambiar las condiciones que hicieron que la plaga se transformara en un problema? La prevención es siempre el mejor modo de manejar los problemas de plagas. ¿Cambiarán las condiciones debido al clima o a otros factores ambientales? ¿Es el problema debido a prácticas de jardinería que pueden modificarse? Cada plaga específica requiere condiciones ambientales óptimas para llegar a causar daño. Por ejemplo, en muchas plantas se favorece el desarrollo del oídio en la sombra y por condiciones que estimulan el crecimiento de las plantas fuera de estación. A veces, si se exponen las plantas al sol, se abre el follaje para facilitar la circulación de aire y no se fertiliza en forma excesiva, se evita que la enfermedad llegue a ser seria. El riego por aspersión también puede reducir los problemas de oídio en ciertas plantas. Aparte de un pesticida, ¿hay otra solución efectiva? Hay muchas maneras de manejar las plagas sin pesticidas:\tControl con prácticas de cultivo (Podar correctamente y seguir un buen plan de fertilización y riego, o seleccionar variedades y especies resistentes a las plagas.)\tControl físico (Por ejemplo, aplicar recubrimientos protectores [mulches] sobre el suelo, para evitar que crezcan las malezas, o solarizar el suelo para controlar patógenos y semillas de malezas.)\nControl mecánico (Quitar malezas con azadón, rociar las hojas con agua a presión para desalojar insectos o utilizar trampas o barreras para que las plagas no puedan ingresar.)\tControl biológico (Utilizar organismos benéficos, tales como insectos que se alimentan de otros insectos o los parasitan.)\tResiembra (En casos extremos donde el cultivo requiere tratamientos de pesticidas excesivos, considere en resembrar usando una especie o variedad de mayor resistencia a la plaga.)\tSi usted decide usar un pesticida, hágalo con un programa de manejo integrado de plagas (IPM, por sus siglas en inglés) que también incluya el uso de métodos no-químicos. El control más satisfactorio y duradero de una plaga se logrará casi siempre aplicando una combinación de medidas. CÓMO ELEGIR EL PESTICIDA CORRECTO El primer paso para escoger un pesticida es identificar que está originando el problema correctamente (por ejemplo, el insecto, la maleza o la enfermedad especifica). Si la plaga fuera identificada incorrectamente, usted no podrá aplicar un pesticida o estrategia eficaz de manejo. Si no confía en poder hacer esto sólo en base a su propia experiencia, solicite ayuda de la oficina local de Extensión Cooperativa de la Universidad de California u otra fuente confiable. Para identificar las plagas más importantes de las plantas ornamentales más comunes, consulte las tablas que aparecen en la parte de atrás de las siguientes publicaciones (actualmente disponibles sólo en inglés) de la división de Agricultura y Recursos Naturales de la Universidad de California: Pests of the Garden and Small Farm and Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs. Si es realmente necesario aplicar un pesticida, escoja el que sea eficaz para la plaga en cuestión y que además presente el menor riesgo para la salud humana y el medio ambiente. Una buena fuente de información para identificar los métodos y pesticidas más eficaces y menos tóxicos para el control de una plaga específicas es la serie de publicaciones sobre plagas, Pest Notes (Notas sobre plagas), de la Universidad de California. Notas sobre plagas están disponibles en las oficinas locales de Extensión Cooperativa de la Universidad de California o en la red del Programa de Manejo Integrado de Plagas de la Universidad de California (UC IPM, por sus siglas en inglés). Para seleccionar un pesticida, es importante verificar que la etiqueta incluya la plaga que usted quiere controlar y el sitio donde se encuentra. Sin embargo, no se base en la etiqueta como única fuente de información para seleccionar el mejor producto de control. Además de incluir las plagas que el pesticida controla eficazmente, las etiquetas incluyen con frecuencia plagas que el producto controla solamente en forma parcial. Por lo tanto, la mejor estrategia es obtener información en publicaciones de la Universidad de California, de las oficinas de Extensión Cooperativa o de otros expertos. Antes de comprar un pesticida, también lea la etiqueta para asegurarse de que el producto sea adecuado para aplicar a sus plantas o lugar de tratamiento. Por ejemplo:\tAsegúrese de que la etiqueta incluya el tipo particular de planta o lugar que va a tratar.\tNo use pesticidas en plantas comestibles si la etiqueta indica que es solo para uso en plantas ornamentales.\tNunca use en interiores pesticidas cuya etiqueta indique \"For external use only\" (para uso en exteriores únicamente).\tLos pesticidas pueden causar mucho daño a algunas plantas; lea la etiqueta para asegurarse de que las plantas tratadas no sufran daño.\tPor último, cuando elija pesticidas, recuerde que la mayoría (aún los más potentes) controlan sólo ciertas etapas del crecimiento de una plaga. Muchos insecticidas matan solamente la etapa larval del insecto (por ejemplo, las orugas) y no afectan los huevos ni las crisálidas (pupa). Otros insecticidas matan solamente insectos en la etapa adulta. Muchos fungicidas son preventivos y no eliminan las infecciones existentes, si bien pueden frenar su desarrollo. De la misma manera, algunos herbicidas (de preemergencia) eliminan las malezas que están en la etapa de germinación pero no las ya establecidas, mientras que otros (de postemergencia) son eficaces sólo para controlar las malezas que están en crecimiento activo. Siempre lea la etiqueta del pesticida En la etiqueta del pesticida hay información importante sobre el producto. La etiqueta es un documento legal que se requiere para todos los pesticidas registrados en los Estados Unidos. La Agencia de Protección Ambiental de los Estados Unidos (EPA, por sus siglas en inglés) debe aprobar la etiqueta. Siempre mantenga el producto en su envase original con la etiqueta. La información de la etiqueta incluye:\tnombre comercial o nombre de marca\tingredientes activos y sus porcentajes por peso o por volumen\ttipos de plantas o lugares donde se puede usar el pesticida\tlas plagas que puede controlar\tqué cantidad puede usar\tcómo y cuándo aplicar\tla ropa y el equipo de protección personal requeridos\tpalabra de señal que define la toxicidad humana de corto plazo: DANGER o PELIGRO, WARNING (Advertencia), o CAUTION (Cuidado)\tavisos de precaución que definen los peligros para las personas, animales domésticos o el medio ambiente\tmedidas de emergencia y primeros auxilios a tomar si alguien ha estado expuesto al producto\tcómo almacenar y eliminar correctamente los pesticidas y los envases vacíos\tALTERNATIVAS MENOS TÓXICAS Escoja el pesticida que sea menos tóxico para solucionar su problema de plagas. Las alternativas menos tóxicas son generalmente las que sugieren las publicaciones de la Universidad de California sobre el manejo integrado de plagas, UC IPM Pest Notes (Notas sobre plagas) . Algunos ejemplos de insecticidas menos tóxicos son los aceites insecticidas derivados de petróleo o de plantas, los jabones y el insecticida microbiano Bacillus thuringiensis . Los pesticidas se utilizan porque matan o controlan la plaga que se busca eliminar. Los pesticidas “selectivos” matan únicamente unos pocos organismos que son muy parecidos. Otros pesticidas tienen un control de espectro más amplio y eliminan una amplia gama de plagas, pero también eliminan organismos que no se busca controlar. La mayoría de los pesticidas tiene algún impacto negativo sobre el medio ambiente. Por ejemplo, algunos insecticidas de baja toxicidad humana pueden ser altamente tóxicos para insectos benéficos, tales como las avispas parásitas u otros organismos útiles tales como abejas de miel, lombrices de tierra e invertebrados acuáticos. La mayoría de los herbicidas eliminan selectivamente algunas malezas, pero también pueden matar plantas deseables si no se los usa correctamente. La persistencia de los pesticidas—o sea, el tiempo que permanecen en estado tóxico en el medio ambiente—también es un factor relacionado con la seguridad de los pesticidas. Los pesticidas que se descomponen rápidamente tienen, en general, un menor impacto negativo sobre el medio ambiente, aunque son más difíciles de usar. Debido a que no dejan residuos tóxicos que maten plagas que aparezcan horas o días después de la aplicación, estos pesticidas de rápida descomposición deben aplicarse justo en el momento de la etapa vulnerable de la plaga. Las palabras de señal— Danger (Peligro), Warning (Advertencia) o Caution (Cuidado)—que aparecen en la etiqueta de un pesticida, estan relacionandas a la toxicidad inmediata de una sola exposición al producto en humanos. Con los años, estas palabras se han convertido en la guía principal para que el consumidor sepa la seguridad relativa de los productos. Sin embargo, las palabras de señal no indican el potencial que tienen los productos de causar problemas crónicos (por ejemplo, cáncer, problemas reproductivos u otros efectos de largo plazo sobre la salud). Tampoco reflejan los peligros potenciales que representan para la vida silvestre, para insectos benéficos y para muchos otros organismos que no se busca controlar. Sin embargo, la mayoría de los productos para el hogar y jardín son relativamente seguros. Tienen poca probabilidad de causar daño a las personas, si se siguen cuidadosamente las instrucciones de la etiqueta. Los avisos de precaución de las etiquetas brindan información adicional sobre efectos perjudiciales u otras medidas preventivas que deberán tomarse. Para obtener más información sobre los peligros de algunos pesticidas específicos, lea las Hojas de Seguridad de Producto (MSDS, por sus siglas en inglés) suministradas por el fabricante del pesticida. También puede consultar con el Centro Nacional de Información de Pesticidas, o llamar al 1-800-858-7378. EQUIPOS PARA APLICACIÓN DE PESTICIDAS Lea cuidadosamente la etiqueta del pesticida y asegúrese de que tenga el equipo correcto para aplicar el producto en forma segura. Use ropa protectora para evitar exposición, aún cuando aplique los pesticidas más seguros. Como mínimo, el equipo de protección personal deberá incluir guantes de goma, protección de los ojos, camisa de manga larga, pantalón largo, calcetines, y zapatos cerrados. Evite usar guantes de algodón o máscaras livianas para polvo que puedan absorber el producto y causar un contacto prolongado con la piel. Lea cuidadosamente la etiqueta del pesticida para ver los requisitos adicionales de protección. El equipo requerido varía según el lugar de aplicación, el pesticida que haya elegido y su deseo de trabajar con aparatos de aplicación más complicados. En muchas aplicaciones de pesticidas en el hogar y el jardín, la mejor opción es comprar un producto “listo para usar” y ya envasado en un rociador de bomba a gatillo . Los productos “listos para usar” evitan la necesidad de tener que diluir y mezclar los pesticidas o comprar equipos especiales; son excelentes para aplicar tratamientos localizados en plantas y arbustos pequeños. En el otro extremo están los rociadores de aire comprimido, que requieren una cuidadosa operación y mantenimiento además de un mezclado exacto de los productos químicos. Si usted es el que mezcla sus propios pesticidas, mantenga un juego de cucharas o tazas para medir uso exclusivo con pesticidas. Se recomienda identificarlos como “SOLAMENTE PARA PESTICIDAS” para distinguirlos de los utensilios de cocina, y mantenerlos bien alejados de los lugares donde se preparan alimentos. El mejor lugar para guardar pesticidas y los equipos utilizados para mezclarlos y aplicarlos es un armario cerrado con llave dentro de un cobertizo en el jardín, el garaje, o en el cuarto de lavado bien ventilado. Si usted está aplicando productos para controlar malezas, mantenga el rociador únicamente para ese propósito y colóquele una etiqueta que diga “PARA MALEZAS SOLAMENTE”. Si no, los residuos de herbicida que queden en el rociador podrán dañar las plantas si ese mismo equipo se usa para aplicar otro tipo de pesticida o fertilizante. Bañese lo antes posible después de cada aplicación. La ropa que haya utilizado se debe lavar aparte de la demás ropa. Nunca fume, beba, coma ni use el baño después de aplicar pesticidas, sin antes lavarse. Cómo diluir un herbicida\tEn la mayoría de los herbicidas, la dosis de aplicación se expresa en onzas de producto por cada 100 pies cuadrados o por cada 1,000 pies cuadrados. Por eso usted deberá conocer la superficie a tratar para poder determinar la cantidad de producto a utilizar. Supongamos que usted esté tratando de eliminar malezas en su césped y la etiqueta del herbicida diga: “Usar 2 onzas por cada 1,000 pies cuadrados”. Después de medir la superficie del césped, usted nota que éste sólo tiene 600 pies cuadrados. Entonces, deberá hacer el siguiente cálculo para saber la cantidad de herbicida a utilizar: (600 pies cuadrados/1,000 pies cuadrados) x 2 onzas = 0.6 x 2 onzas = 1.2 onzas de herbicida para tratar todo su césped.\tTambién debe calcular la cantidad de agua que necesita agregar a su rociador. Las etiquetas de insecticidas y fungicidas y muchas de las etiquetas de herbicidas indican la cantidad de agua que deberá agregar para diluir el producto. Si la etiqueta no especifica un cierto volumen de agua, usted podrá determinarlo rociando una pequeña superficie con una cantidad conocida de agua limpia. Luego, divida por la fracción de la superficie donde piensa aplicar herbicida. Por ejemplo, si estimó que un cuarto de galón de agua cubrió 100 pies cuadrados, podrá calcular que necesita 6 cuartos de galón para cubrir 600 pies cuadrados. Mezcle entonces su 1.2 onzas de herbicida en 6 cuartos de galón de agua.\tCÓmo medir y diluir pesticidas concentrados Es fundamental medir correctamente las formulaciones concentradas de pesticidas para que su uso sea eficaz y seguro. La dosis de aplicación de la mayoría de los insecticidas y fungicidas figura en la etiqueta y está expresada en onzas por galón de agua utilizada en el rociador. Es esencial que usted siga estos procedimientos correctamente y diluya y aplique los productos según lo requerido. En el caso de herbicidas y de algunas aplicaciones de insecticidas y fungicidas (por ejemplo, en céspedes), la etiqueta indicará la cantidad de pesticida que se deberá usar en una superficie determinada. En estos casos, usted tendrá que medir la superficie a tratar para poder calcular la cantidad de producto que debe mezclar. Ver recuadro 1: Cómo diluir un herbicida. Recuerde que si la etiqueta especifica una determinada dosis de dilución, usted debe seguir exactamente esas indicaciones. Antes de mezclar el pesticida, pruebe su rociador con agua para asegurarse de que cubra la superficie recomendada con la cantidad recomendada de solución. De lo contrario, deberá ajustar la dosis de aplicación caminando o aplicando el pesticida más lento o más rápido. A menudo, las instrucciones para aplicar insecticidas y fungicidas en árboles frutales y ornamentales no especifican los pies cuadrados de superficie a tratar. Es común que indiquen algo como: “Moje las plantas a punto de goteo; moje completamente ambos lados de las hojas”. Para este tipo de aplicaciones, o para tratamientos localizados, también es aconsejable probar el rociador con agua, para ver qué cantidad de solución se necesita para mojar completamente un árbol frutal u ornamental u otra superficie. De este modo, usted sabrá qué cantidad de producto deberá mezclar. Nunca utilice más de la cantidad recomendada en la etiqueta del producto. No controlará la plaga más rápidamente y usted malgastará pesticida, tiempo y dinero, mientras que puede dañar las plantas y contaminar el medio ambiente con un exceso de productos químicos. Mezcle únicamente la cantidad de producto que necesite de inmediato y no guarde las soluciones de pesticidas que le sobren. La calidad de la mezela puede cambiar debido a temperaturas altas o muy bajas o a decantación del producto. CÓmo reducir la contaminaciÓn ambiental Aplique tratamientos localizados donde la plaga es más abundante. Evite hacer aplicaciones generalizadas por todo el jardín o la casa. Para tratamientos localizados, mezcle el pesticida de acuerdo a las instrucciones de la etiqueta y aplique la mezcla únicamente a la superficie afectada. Otras maneras de limitar la exposición del medio ambiente a los pesticidas son colocar trampas de cebo para hormigas, utilizar aplicadores a soga o con pantallas para ciertos herbicidas y hacer tratamientos directos a los troncos de los árboles para controlar ciertos insectos. Asegúrese de que los pesticidas se apliquen correctamente a la planta o al lugar afectado y que no se desplacen a otras plantas o lugares fuera del sitio de aplicación. El viento puede desplazar fácilmente los pesticidas del lugar de aplicación. No aplique cuando haga viento, porque los pesticidas pueden ser transportados a lugares donde no se los necesita o requiere. Evite que la aplicación se escurra o penetre en alcantarillas, arroyos u otras masas de agua para prevenir de este modo la contaminación de las fuentes de agua. Evite aplicar productos químicos inmediatamente antes del riego o de una lluvia, a menos que las etiquetas requieran que se irrigue justo después de la aplicación. También evite aplicar pesticidas en superficies duras tales como aceras, entradas para autos y cimientos. Pueden escurrirse fácilmente e ir a parar a las alcantarillas. Siga las pautas que se indican para proteger la calidad del medio ambiente y mantener los pesticidas fuera de nuestros cursos de agua. Evitar que los pesticidas lleguen a nuestros cursos de agua Los pesticidas aplicados en jardines pueden desplazarse del lugar de aplicación por efecto del viento, o escurrirse hacia alcantarillas o arroyos.\tEsté atento a los patrones climáticos y no aplique pesticidas inmediatamente antes de una lluvia o cuando haga viento.\tEvite aplicar pesticidas en superficies duras como por ejemplo aceras y entradas de auto, donde puedan escurrirse fácilmente.\tLea las advertencias de las etiquetas acerca del uso de pesticidas en cercanías de cursos de agua tales como arroyos, ríos y lagos.\tNunca vierta pesticidas en alcantarillas, fregaderos o inodoros.\tBajo ninguna circunstancia debe lavarse el equipo de control de plagas en un lugar donde el agua de enjuague pueda llegar a cunetas, alcantarillas o cursos de agua expuestos.\tNunca aplique dosis mayores a las especificadas en la etiqueta del pesticida.\tTenga en cuenta que algunos pesticidas se escurren más fácilmente que otros en las superficies y por eso tienen mayor potencial de desplazarse fuera del lugar de aplicación durante el riego o las lluvias. Se puede obtenir el indice de riesgo de filtración y escurrimiento de pesticidas específicos en la base de datos WaterTox (en Ingles) del sitio Web de UC IPM.\tCÓmo deshacerse de los pesticidas sobrantes Trate de comprar únicamente la cantidad de pesticida que utilizará en forma inmediata. Esto eliminará la necesidad de almacenar los productos que no se usan. Si no puede utilizar todos sus pesticidas dentro de un tiempo razonable, compártalos con un amigo o vecino que pueda usarlos. En cualquier caso, manténgalos siempre en sus envases originales. Nunca los guarde en botellas de bebidas vacías o en cualquier otro recipiente que pueda confundirse con un envase de bebidas. Se han visto casos de personas que se han envenenado o muerto al beber de estos envases sin darse cuenta. No mezcle más pesticida del que pueda usar de inmediato. Se debe aplicar el pesticida diluido de acuerdo a las instrucciones en la etiqueta, en las plantas o lugares indicados y en las dosis indicadas en la etiqueta, hasta que se vacíe el tanque. Lo que sobre del pesticida debe llevarse a un depósito de eliminación de deshechos domésticos peligrosos. No vierta los productos sobrantes o vencidos en cañerías, en el suelo o en cursos de agua abiertos, cunetas, alcantarillas o desagües ni los tire en la basura. La única manera legal de deshacerse de pesticidas es llevarlos al depósito de eliminación de desechos domésticos peligrosos de su zona. En California, llame al Teléfono de Emergencia Ambiental de California (California Environmental Hotline), (1-800-253-2687), para que le informen la ubicación del depósito de eliminación de deshechos domésticos peligrosos más cercano a su propiedad o consulte el sitio Web Earth911 . Los dueños de casa que tengan envases vacíos de pesticidas concentrado de uso casero pueden echarlos en la basura, sin enjuagar. Los envases vacíos de productos “listos para usar” también se pueden colocar en la basura. Los aplicadores de pesticidas profesionales que usen pesticidas concentrados líquidos deberán enjuagar el envase tres veces antes de desecharlo. El mejor momento para enjuagar el envase es cuando va a usar lo que le queda del pesticida. Vierta el pesticida que le queda en el rociador. Agréguele agua al envase vacío de pesticida, colóquele la tapa, agítelo y vierta el líquido al tanque del rociador. Repita la operación dos veces más. Si es necesario, agréguele más agua al tanque del rociador para obtener la concentración correcta. De este modo, usted habrá enjuagado el envase tres veces y habrá aprovechado el agua del enjuague para la aplicación del pesticida. Si queda liquido del enjuague sin usar, no lo vierta en cañerías ni en desagües, ni lo deposite en la basura. El líquido de enjuague se considera desecho peligroso y debe ser eliminado correctamente en un depósito de desechos peligrosos o como se recomendó anteriormente. Pesticidas de interiores y pesticidas de exteriores Dentro del hogar, utilice únicamente pesticidas cuya etiqueta especifique que se pueden usar en interiores. Muchos pesticidas para uso exterior están diseñados para descomponerse en substancias menos tóxicas con la ventilación, la luz y la lluvia. En ausencia de estos tres elementos, los pesticidas pueden tardar en descomponerse y causar toxicidad en humanos y animales domésticos. CÓmo contratar una empresa de control de plagas Es posible que usted no tenga tiempo ni conocimiento suficiente para resolver su problema de plagas y aplicar de manera segura el producto adecuado para controlarlas. En este caso, una opción sería contratar un servicio de control de plagas para que haga el trabajo. Ver la Nota sobre plagas que trata de cómo contratar una empresa de control de plagas (Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company) para obtener información acerca de cómo elegir un contratista. Los operadores de pesticidas autorizados para control de plagas tienen acceso a algunos productos que no están disponibles en negocios minoristas. Muchos problemas de plagas, como por ejemplo la invasión de termitas o el control de plagas en árboles grandes, requieren pesticidas, equipos y entrenamiento técnico especiales para un manejo más efectivo. Si bien los servicios profesionales pueden ser caros, la inversión bien puede valer la pena cuando se trata de resolver un problema grave.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Six species of voles from the genus Microtus occur in California. Collectively they are called either meadow mice or voles. Two species are responsible for the majority of damage. The California vole, M. californicus, is the most widespread vole in the state, found in the Owens and Central valleys and nearly the entire length of the coastal range. The montane vole, M. montanus, inhabits northeastern California and the eastern Sierra slope. Voles usually don’t invade homes and shouldn’t be confused with the house mouse, Mus musculus. Voles are intriguing small mammals, because some populations regularly go through cycles of low to high numbers with occasional sudden increases that can send numbers soaring up to several thousand per acre.",

Voles are intriguing small mammals, because some populations regularly go through cycles of low to high numbers with occasional sudden increases that can send numbers soaring up to several thousand per acre.",
    "damagePestNote": "Voles cause damage by feeding on a wide range of garden plants including artichoke, beet, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, carrot, cauliflower, celery, lettuce, spinach, sweet potato, tomato, and turnip. They also can damage turf and other landscape plantings such as lilies and dichondra. Voles will gnaw the bark of fruit trees including almond, apple, avocado, cherry, citrus, and olive. Vole damage to tree trunks normally occurs from a few inches aboveground to a few inches below ground. If the damage is below ground, you will need to remove soil from the base of the tree to see it. Although voles are poor climbers, if they can climb onto low-hanging branches, they can cause damage higher up on trees as well. Gnaw marks about 1/8 inch wide and 3/8 inch long in irregular patches and various angles along with other signs including droppings, runways, and burrows indicate vole damage. If voles gnaw completely around the trunk or roots, it will disrupt the tree’s flow of nutrients and water, a process known as girdling. Girdling damage on trunks and roots can kill trees. Signs of partial trunk or root girdling can include a prolonged time before young trees bear fruit, reduced fruit yield, abnormal yellowish leaf color, and overall poor vigor. Where snow cover is present, damage to trees can extend a foot or more up the trunk. Damage that occurs beneath snow cover often escapes notice until it is too late. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies voles as nongame mammals, meaning if voles are injuring or threatening growing crops or other property, the owner or tenant of the property has permission to control them at any time and in any legal manner.",
    "managementPestNote": "To prevent vole damage, you need to manage the population in your area before it reaches high numbers. You often can achieve this by removing or reducing the vegetative cover, making the area unsuitable to voles. Removing cover also makes detecting voles and other rodents easier. Once vole numbers begin to increase rapidly, the damage they do to ornamental and garden plants and to trees can be quite severe. Monitoring Guidelines Be alert for the presence of voles. Look for fresh trails in the grass, burrows, droppings, and evidence of feeding in the garden and surrounding area. Pay particular attention to adjacent areas that have heavy vegetation, because such areas are likely sources of invasions. Habitat Modification One way to effectively deter vole populations is to make the habitat less suitable to them. Weeds, heavy mulch, and dense vegetative cover encourage voles by providing food and protection from predators and environmental stresses. If you remove this protection, their numbers will decline. You can reduce the area from which voles can invade gardens or landscaped areas by regularly mowing, spraying with herbicides, grazing, or tilling grassy areas along ditch banks, right-of-ways, or field edges adjacent to gardens. If feasible, weed-free strips can serve as buffers around areas requiring protection. The wider the cleared strip, the less apt voles will be to cross and become established in gardens. A minimum width of 15 feet is recommended, but even that can be ineffective when vole numbers are high. A 4-foot-diameter circle around the base of young trees or vines that is free of vegetation or a buffer strip 4 feet or more along a row of trees can reduce problems, because voles prefer not to feed in the open. Exclusion Wire fences at least 12 inches above the ground with a mesh size of 1/4 inch or smaller will help to exclude voles from the entire garden. These fences either can stand alone or be attached to the bottom of an existing fence (Figure. 3). Bury the bottom edge of the fence 6 to 10 inches to prevent voles from tunneling beneath it. A weed-free barrier on the outside of the fence will increase its effectiveness. You can protect young trees, vines, and ornamentals from girdling by using cylinders made from hardware cloth, sheet metal, or heavy plastic that surround the trunk. Support or brace these devices, so they can’t be pushed over or pressed against the trunk. Also make sure they are wide enough to allow for tree growth and, in areas with snow, are tall enough to extend above snow level. Bury the bottom of the protective device below the soil surface to prevent voles from digging beneath it. You can cut out both ends of individual milk cartons, tin cans, or plastic soda bottles and fit them over small plants. You’ll want to frequently check protective devices to make sure meadow mice haven’t gnawed through or dug beneath the cylinders and are hiding inside the tree guard while they feed on the tree. Trapping When voles aren’t numerous or when the population is concentrated in a small area, trapping can be effective. Use a sufficient number of traps to control the population. For a small garden a dozen traps is probably the minimum number required, but for larger areas, you might need 50 or more. You can use a simple, wooden mouse trap baited with a peanut butter-oatmeal mixture or apple slices, although often you won’t need to use bait, because voles will trigger the trap as they pass over it. Trap placement is crucial. Voles seldom stray from their runways, so set traps along these routes. Look for burrows and runways in grass or mulch in or near the garden. Place the traps at right angles to the runways with the trigger end in the runway. Examine traps daily, removing dead voles or resetting sprung traps as needed. Continue to trap in one location until you stop catching voles then move the trap to a new location 15 to 20 feet away. Destroy old runways or burrows with a shovel or rototiller to deter new voles from immigrating to the site. Bury dead voles, or place them in plastic bags in the trash. Because voles can carry infectious pathogens or parasites, don’t handle them without rubber gloves; you can use a plastic bag slipped over your hand and arm as a glove. Once you have removed the vole from the trap, hold it with your “bagged” hand and turn the bag inside out while slipping it off your arm and hand. Be sure to keep small children and pets out of areas where you have set traps. Baiting When voles are numerous or when damage occurs over large areas, toxic baits can be the quickest and most practical means of control. Take necessary measures to ensure the safety of children, pets, and nontarget animals, and follow all product label instructions carefully. Anticoagulants, often referred to as multiple-feeding baits, interfere with an animal’s blood-clotting mechanisms, eventually leading to death. They probably are the safest type of rodent bait for use around homes and gardens, because they are slow acting, must be consumed during a period of 5 or more days to be effective, and have an effective antidote, vitamin K1, making it safer to use around children and pets. Anticoagulant baits are available at some county agriculture commissioners’ offices as well as at retail stores. You can’t use some anticoagulants such as brodifacoum and bromadiolone because of the potential risk they pose to predators such as cats and dogs. Check the label carefully to ensure it lists that the bait is suitable for use on voles or meadow mice. Because the pest must feed on anticoagulant baits during a period of 5 days, the bait must be available until the vole population is under control. Usually baiting every other day for a total of 3 applications is effective. As with trapping, bait placement is very important. Place the recommended amount of bait in runways or next to burrows, so voles will find it during their normal travels. Generally, spot treating—placing bait in a specific place, such as a runway—is the preferred method of baiting, but in areas of heavy ground cover or if the area you are treating is quite large, broadcasting might be a better option if the label allows it. When broadcasting bait, be sure to spread it evenly over the infested area. If you use this technique, you probably will have to broadcast every other day for a total of 3 or 4 applications. Repellents Commercial repellents are available for protecting plants from voles, but their effectiveness is questionable and their use often isn’t practical. You must apply them before damage occurs. Voles usually damage plants at or just beneath the soil surface, making adequate coverage difficult or impossible. Don’t apply repellents to food crops unless the product label specifies such use. Natural Control Many predators including coyotes, foxes, badgers, weasels, cats, gulls, and especially hawks and owls eat voles. However, in most cases predators can’t keep vole populations below damaging levels. Many predators simply don’t hunt close to homes and gardens where control is needed. Most predators have a broad-based diet and readily shift to alternative prey when the number of voles declines. Predators rarely, if ever, take every last vole; thus, a residual population remains. With their extremely high reproductive potential, any remaining voles could repopulate an area in a short period. With this potential for severe damage, a homeowner or gardener can’t afford to wait for a predator to appear but must take immediate action to prevent the loss of valuable plantings. Effective, immediate action usually involves baiting or trapping and habitat modification. As with all animals, natural constraints limit vole numbers. Because populations won’t increase indefinitely, one alternative is to do nothing, and let nature limit the voles. Experience has shown, however, that around homes and gardens the natural population peak is too high, and damage will be above tolerable limits. Other Control Methods Burrow fumigants such as gas cartridges aren’t effective for controlling voles, because their burrow system is shallow and has numerous open holes. Commercial pest control operators can use the fumigant aluminum phosphide under very limited conditions. Electromagnetic or ultrasonic devices and flooding also are ineffective against voles.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Occasionally, lizards can enter homes and buildings through small openings, especially gaps beneath doors. They are excellent climbers so they can enter at any structural opening 1/4 inch or larger. Should a lizard enter your home, there are several ways to capture and release it outdoors. None of the methods is easy; so once the lizard is relocated outdoors make sure it can’t reenter the home (see section below). Trapping For the adventurous, there is a method known as “noosing.” Noosing involves using a pole such as a fishing rod to slip a noose over the lizard’s head and gently tightening the noose to capture the lizard, which can then be safely carried outdoors and set free. This method requires a degree of skill because the noose must be slowly lowered over the lizard’s head and then quickly but gently tightened by lifting the lizard with the pole before it escapes. Nooses can be made out of relatively stiff materials like dental floss or fish line. Another way to trap a lizard is to carefully put a small box or other container over it. With the lizard in the box, gently slip a piece of cardboard under the box to cover the opening. Pick the entire unit up and take it outside to be released. Alligator lizards move somewhat slower than western fence lizards and often can just be grabbed gently by hand and taken outdoors. Because an alligator lizard may bite, you can wear a glove when you grab it. Exclusion To prevent lizards from entering the home, seal all small openings 1/4 inch and larger. Check areas such as corners of doors and windows, around water pipes, electrical service entrances, ventilation screens, water pipes, etc. Threshold sweeps and tight-fitting door seals with no gaps at the edges are important prevention measures. Unlike rats and mice, lizards cannot gnaw through wood or other common building materials. A number of materials can be used to seal access points, including insulating foam, caulking, flashing, and steel wool. Good sanitation can be helpful in reducing the number of lizards around a home, although it alone will not eliminate their presence. Off-the-ground storage of lumber, crates, boxes, sacks, gardening equipment, and other household items will make an area less suitable for lizards by reducing their hiding spots. Other Control Methods There are no toxicants or repellents registered in California that can be used to kill or repel lizards.

    "damagePestNote": "Ground squirrels damage many food-bearing and ornamental plants. Particularly vulnerable are grains, as well as nut and fruit trees such as almond, apple, apricot, avocado, orange, peach, pistachio, prune, and walnut. In gardens, ground squirrels will eat vegetables in the seedling stage. They can damage young shrubs, vines, and trees by gnawing bark, girdling trunks (completely removing a strip of bark from a tree's outer circumference), eating twigs and leaves, and burrowing around roots. Ground squirrels will gnaw on plastic sprinkler heads and irrigation boxes and lines. Burrowing can be quite destructive. Burrows and mounds make it difficult to mow lawns and other grassy areas, and they present hazards to machinery, pedestrians, and livestock. Burrows around trees and shrubs can damage and dry out roots; this can sometimes topple trees. Burrowing beneath buildings and other structures sometimes produces damage that necessitates costly repair. Ground squirrels can harbor diseases harmful to humans, particularly when squirrel populations are high. A major concern is bubonic plague, caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis and transmitted to humans, pets, and other animals by fleas associated with the squirrels. Ground squirrels are susceptible to plague, which has wiped out entire colonies. If you find unusual numbers of squirrels or other rodents dead for no apparent reason, notify public health officials. Do not handle dead squirrels under these circumstances. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies ground squirrels as nongame mammals. An owner or tenant can control (“take”), in any legal manner, nongame mammals that are injuring growing crops or other property. Some species of tree squirrels, on the other hand, are classified as game animals (with a hunting season) that cannot be taken without a permit. See the Pest Notes: Tree Squirrels for more information. No license is required for the management of California ground squirrels if it is the owner or tenant who is taking damaging ground squirrels. A trapping license from the California Department of Fish and Wildlife is required for those who are trapping squirrels for hire or profit. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service classifies the Mohave ground squirrel, S. mohavensis, and the San Joaquin antelope squirrel, Ammospermophilus nelsoni, as threatened species. Therefore, both are protected animals. Although you are unlikely to mistake either of these relatively small squirrels for the much larger California ground squirrel, their ranges could overlap in some areas, so ensure proper identification before instituting control measures. The endangered San Joaquin kit fox (Vulpes macrotis mutica), several endangered species of kangaroo rats (Dipodomys spp.), the riparian brush rabbit (Sylvilagus bachmani riparius), the riparian wood rat (Neotoma fuscipes riparia), and some endangered amphibians and reptiles also are within the California ground squirrels' range, so some squirrel management techniques could impact them as well. If the kit fox is found in your county, contact your county agricultural commissioner for additional information. For a range map, see the California Department of Pesticide Regulation's website (listed in References). Before using pesticides for ground squirrel management, read the product label to determine if any restrictions exist on rodent control within the ranges of these and other endangered and protected animals.",
    "managementPestNote": "Effective management depends heavily upon understanding the unique life cycle and behavior of the California ground squirrel. For example, baiting with treated grain is effective in summer and fall, because squirrels primarily feed on seeds during this period. Burrow fumigation is most effective in spring, when moist soil helps seal gasses in the burrow system. Fumigating at this time is also more effective in reducing ground squirrel numbers since squirrels die before they can reproduce. Table 1 shows the yearly activities of the California ground squirrel and times when baiting, trapping, fumigation, and other management practices are generally most effective.\tTable 1.

This variance may affect management windows. Habitat Modification You'll generally find ground squirrels in open areas, although they sometimes use brush and other vegetation as cover during retreat. Remove brush piles and debris to make an area less desirable in this way. Brush removal also aids in detecting squirrels and their burrows and improving access during management operations. California ground squirrels generally dislike dense vegetation, as it prevents their easy detection of potential predators. Therefore, avoiding mowing and grazing can discourage ground squirrel incidence. Keep in mind, however, that increasing the amount of vegetation in an area may encourage other pest species, like California field voles. Ground squirrels can reinvade a site by moving into vacant burrows. Although not usually possible in urban areas, destroying old burrows by deep ripping them to a depth of at least 20 inches, using a tractor and ripping bars, can slow reinvasion. Simply filling in the burrows with soil does not prevent reinvasion, as ground squirrels easily find and reopen old burrows. Trapping Traps are practical for management when squirrel numbers are low to moderate. Live-catch traps are not often recommended, because they present the problem of animal disposal. It is illegal to relocate wildlife in the State of California without a permit. Live-captured ground squirrels must be released immediately on the property where they were caught, or they must be euthanized by legal and humane measures. Methods of euthanasia considered humane by the American Veterinary Medical Association include gassing with carbon dioxide and shooting. Drowning is not an approved method of euthanasia and is illegal in California (See References). There are several types of traps that kill ground squirrels, including box traps, tunnel traps, and Conibear traps. For box traps and tunnel traps, place them on the ground near squirrel burrows or runways, and bait them with walnuts, almonds, oats, barley, melon rinds or any other food source that the ground squirrels are eating. Place the bait well behind the trigger or tied to it. After you bait traps, place them out with triggers unset for several days so the squirrels can become accustomed to them. After the squirrels are used to taking the bait, rebait and set the traps. To reduce hazards to children, pets, poultry, and nontarget wildlife, place box-type traps inside a covered box with a 3-inch-diameter entrance. Put the box near active burrows with signs of recent diggings. Inactive burrows will be filled with leaves or old straw, or have cobwebs across the entrance. The Conibear trap No. 110 with a 4 1/2-by 4 1/2-inch jaw spread also is an effective kill trap. You can bait the wire trigger, but usually you'll want to leave it unbaited. Place the trap directly in the burrow opening, so the squirrel must pass through it, tripping the trigger. It might be necessary to use soil to partially fill in the burrow entrance around the outer edges of the trap to prevent the squirrel from slipping around the outside of the trap. Closing all other burrows with soil might hasten success by directing the squirrel to the remaining open burrow, which contains the trap. Attach the Conibear trap to a stake to prevent a scavenger from carrying off both it and the squirrel. With this type of trap, leaving the trap baited but unset has little effect on trapping success. Inspect traps at least once a day and remove dead squirrels. Don't handle the carcasses without protective gear. You can use a plastic bag slipped over each hand and arm as a glove. Once you have removed the squirrel from the trap, hold the animal with one hand and turn the bag inside out while slipping it off your arm and hand. Keep small children and pets out of the area while traps are in use. In kit fox areas, spring all Conibear traps before nightfall and reset them the following morning. Also, be mindful of nontarget species in the area (e.g., cats, wildlife) to avoid their inadvertent capture or harm when trapping. Fumigation Burrow fumigation can be a safe method for managing ground squirrels. Fumigation is most effective in spring, or at other times when soil moisture is high. Moist soil helps contain the gas within the burrow system or may be required to properly activate certain fumigants (e.g. aluminum phosphide). Do not fumigate in summer or when the soil is dry, because the gas more readily diffuses into small cracks present in dry soil, making it less effective. Do not fumigate during hibernation, because the ground squirrel plugs its burrow with soil, preventing fumes from reaching the nest chamber. You cannot see this plug by examining the burrow entrance. As with any pesticide, read and follow label instructions, with particular regard for nontarget species and safety factors. Fumigants have restrictions that require products to be applied only within burrows that are greater than a certain distance from structures that may be occupied. Read the product label to determine the application distance requirements pertaining to your site. Be aware of the signs of nontarget species inhabiting inactive ground squirrel burrows. Kit foxes will use an old burrow, enlarging the opening, and often creating a keyhole-shaped entrance. Active pupping dens might contain prey remains, droppings, and matted vegetation, and show signs of fresh paw prints. The burrowing owl (Athene cunicularia) is another potential occupant of abandoned ground squirrel burrows. Do not treat a burrow if you suspect a nontarget animal is present. Fumigate only active ground squirrel burrows. County agricultural commissioners can provide additional information on how to recognize nontarget burrows. The most readily available fumigant for most residential users is the gas cartridge. Some county agricultural commissioners' offices sell United States Department of Agriculture gas cartridges, which are designed for fumigating burrowing rodents. Other types of fumigation cartridges are also available at retail outlets. Instructions for the use of gas cartridges are product-specific, soit is very important to consult the product label before use. Generally, to use a gas cartridge, puncture the cartridge cap and insert a fuse into the puncture hole. Place the cartridge into an active burrow entrance with the fuse pointing towards the interior of the burrow. Light the fuse and push the cartridge into the burrow with a shovel handle. Immediately seal and tightly pack the burrow opening with soil, but don’t cover the cartridge itself with soil. Multiple entrances to the same burrow system do not necessarily need to be treated separately, but it is important to seal any additional openings. Use the smoke escaping from the burrow to identify these entrances. Larger burrow systems, however, may require two or more cartridges. After 24 hours, check for reopened burrows, and re-treat as needed. Aluminum phosphide is another burrow fumigant that is very effective as a ground squirrel management tool. However, its use is restricted to licensed pest management professionals. Additionally, it cannot be used within 100 feet of any structure that is, or may potentially be, occupied by humans, pets, or livestock. This eliminates its use from most residential areas. Pressurized exhaust systems that inject concentrated carbon monoxide into burrow systems are also legal for use in California. Of these devices, the Pressurized Exhaust Rodent Controller (PERC) machine has been extensively tested and has proven to be effective for the management of California ground squirrels. Devices that produce carbon dioxide for burrow fumigation are currently seeking registration in California and may be available soon. As with all burrow fumigation applications, these devices will be most effective under moist soil conditions. Toxic Baits Anticoagulant rodenticide options for residential use are limited to first-generation active ingredients such as diphacinone. These products must be applied in tamper-resistant bait stations, usually within a specified distance from a manmade structure. Check product labels for specific distances and application rates. Diphacinone and other first-generation anticoagulant rodenticides (FGARs) are considered multiple feeding toxins, meaning that a ground squirrel must feed on the bait multiple times over several days to ingest a toxic dose. FGARs have low primary toxicity concerns (that is, mortality of nontarget wildlife that directly consume the toxicant), partly because they require multiple feedings to acquire a toxic dose and also because FGARs can be applied in bait stations that are not generally accessible to nontarget species. If bait is accessible to nontarget species, then alternative management options must be considered. Anticoagulants are the only rodenticide type registered in the United States which has an antidote available to reverse the effects. FGAR baits generally require two to four weeks or more to control populations. Continue baiting until all feeding ceases and you no longer see any squirrels. Although few ground squirrels will die above ground, you should pick up and dispose of those that do, as described above in the Trapping section and in accordance with label directions. Also, be sure to pick up and dispose of unused bait upon completion of the management program, according to label instructions. Toxic grain baits containing the active ingredient zinc phosphide can only be applied by licensed pest management professionals and are not available for use by residential users for ground squirrel management. Rodenticide products labeled for use against rats and house mice should never be used for the management of ground squirrels unless ground squirrels are specifically listed on the label as a target species. Other Management Techniques Shooting. Shooting squirrels with small caliber rifles can provide some ground squirrel control, but it is very time-consuming. Additionally, discharging a firearm is not legal in most municipalities. The California Department of Fish and Wildlife (CDFW) has prohibited the use of lead projectiles in some firearms within the range of the California condor. Likewise, leaving lead projectiles behind (within animal carcasses) can be hazardous since it may result in their ingestion by scavengers. Currently, the use of lead ammunition is permitted for take of small nongame animals such as ground squirrels. However, effective July 1, 2019, nonlead ammunition will be required when taking any wildlife with a firearm anywhere in California. Frightening devices . There are no effective squirrel-frightening devices or repellents that will cause ground squirrels to leave their burrows or avoid an area or crop. Burrow exploders. Devices that inject ignitable gasses into ground squirrel burrow systems are not generally recommended for urban use and have not proven to be effective. Biological control . Many predators, including hawks, eagles, rattlesnakes, and coyotes, eat ground squirrels. In most cases, predators are not able to keep ground squirrel populations below the level at which they become pests for the home gardener. Dogs might prevent squirrels from entering small areas, but they cannot manage established squirrel populations. Follow-up For those who live next to wildlands or other areas where squirrels are common, an ongoing management program will be necessary, since squirrels will reinvade over time. Once you have controlled a ground squirrel problem, periodically monitor the area for reinfestation. Check for new burrows and start management actions as soon as you notice new arrivals. It is easier and less expensive to manage a small population rather than to allow it to build up to larger numbers. More detailed information about identification, management, and other resources is available at the UC Ground Squirrel Best Management Practices website.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Pests in Gardens and Landscapes: Quick Tips Ground Squirrel Published 4/19 Read more on this topic Ground squirrels injure many types of plants, harbor diseases harmful to humans, and damage landscapes with their burrowing. Although similar in appearance to tree squirrels, ground squirrels will always retreat to a burrow when frightened, while tree squirrels will climb a tree or other tall structure and never use a burrow. Traps, baits, and burrow fumigants will effectively manage ground squirrels in landscapes and gardens. Identification and behavior: Brownish-gray fur. Body is 9- to 11-inches long, not including a 5- to 9-inch tail that isn't as bushy as a tree squirrel's. Live in colonies in a burrow system where they sleep, rest, rear young, store food, and avoid danger. Active during the day, mainly midmorning through late afternoon, especially on warm, sunny days. Breed once a year, averaging 7 to 8 per litter. When 6 months old, young squirrels resemble adults. Ground squirrels cause damage by: Eating food-bearing and ornamental plants. Gnawing on plastic sprinklers and irrigation lines. Girdling young trees. Burrowing, which causes trip hazards and damages landscapes and structures. How do you manage ground squirrels? Remove brush piles and debris that ground squirrels can use as cover. Destroy old burrows by deep ripping them to a depth of at least 20 inches. Use kill traps (such as box or Conibear traps) only when there is no chance of catching a pet or other wildlife. Live-catch traps are not often recommended, because they present the problem of animal disposal. Place traps on the ground near squirrel burrows or runways. Bait traps with walnuts, almonds, oats, barley, or melon rinds. Trap between February and October. What about pesticides? In spring, fumigate by placing gas cartridges in burrows. In dry conditions, gas cartridges can be a fire hazard. Don't use near buildings. Place anticoagulant baits in secure, tamper-resistant bait stations and provide sufficient product for repeated feedings. Squirrels must eat the bait multiple times over several days. Always follow label instructions for use. Take care not to poison pets or other wildlife. For those who live next to wildlands or other infested areas, ongoing management is necessary. Periodically check the area for signs of reinfestation, such as new burrows. Start management as soon as you notice new squirrels, since it is easier and less expensive to manage a small number of squirrels.",

Because deer mice prefer forests, grasslands, and agricultural crops, they aren’t normally found within urban and residential areas unless fields, forests, or other suitable habitats surround those areas.",
    "damagePestNote": "Because of their small size, deer mice can gain entry into many buildings and often enter vacated homes, cabins, and other structures where they build nests and store food. However, deer mice aren’t common in urban and residential areas unless large or numerous parks and/or fields are nearby. Deer mice damage upholstered furniture, mattresses, clothing, paper, or other materials they find suitable for constructing their nests. Nests, droppings, and other signs left by deer mice are similar to those of house mice. However, deer mice have a much greater tendency to cache food supplies such as acorns, seeds, or nuts than do house mice. This may help in the identification of the species of mouse responsible for the observed damage. Deer mice are also a pest in some forested and agricultural lands. Seed predation by deer mice and other rodents has contributed to slow regeneration or complete reestablishment failure in coniferous forests, especially during the initial stages of regeneration. It is believed that deer mice are the most important predator of seeds in parts of the United States, particularly in Douglas-fir stands, where the deer mouse destroys more Douglas-fir seed than any other mammal or bird. Douglas-fir and other commercial coniferous species are often hand planted despite the added cost, as reforestation by direct seeding of clear-cut areas is particularly prone to predation by deer mice and other seed-eating rodents. Deer mice are known to feed on seeds in row crops, dig up planted melon seeds, and eat alfalfa seed. High populations of deer mice also cause damage to almonds, avocados, citrus, pomegranates, and sugar beets. Hantavirus and Precautions Hantaviruses are a group of viruses that rodents in the family Muridae carry. Deer mice are the principal reservoir of one of these viruses called Sin Nombre virus, which causes Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome (HPS) in people. Although human cases of this virus are rare, HPS can be a severe respiratory disease in humans with fatality rates of about 36%. Deer mice shed the virus in their saliva, urine, and droppings. A person may be exposed to hantavirus by breathing contaminated dust after disturbing or cleaning rodent droppings or nests or by living or working in rodent-infested settings. There is no evidence that North American hantaviruses spread from one person to another. The most effective way to avoid contracting hantavirus from deer mice is to keep them out of houses, cabins, and dwellings by rodent proofing and excluding them from these structures by sealing all small gaps and cracks. Once deer mice infest a dwelling, it is critical to avoid working and sleeping in these areas until the infestation has been controlled and the area has been made safe for humans. Before occupying an infested house, cabin, or associated outbuilding, open the doors and windows to air out the room for at least 30 minutes. Where possible, use an electric fan on windowsills and in door entrances to assist in the process. Be sure to vacate the building during the ventilation process to prevent inhaling aerosolized particles. Wearing a commercially available cloth or paper breathing mask offers some protection and is better than no protection at all. However, only an approved respirator equipped with high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters offers total respiratory protection against airborne viruses. It is important to wear nonfabric gloves (e.g., rubber, latex, vinyl, or nitrile) when cleaning deer mouse-infested buildings. Because humans can contract the virus by inhaling aerosolized deer mouse urine and feces, never stir up dust by vacuuming or sweeping or through any other activity. It is important to properly disinfect the potentially contaminated areas. Thoroughly wet contaminated areas, including trapped deer mice, droppings, and nests, with an appropriate disinfectant solution such as Lysol or a 10% hypochlorite (bleach) solution. To make this bleach solution, mix 1 1/2 cups of household bleach in 1 gallon of water (or one part bleach to nine parts water). Note that a bleach solution may damage rugs and fabrics and irritate skin. Wear nonfabric gloves whenever touching or cleaning contaminated surfaces or when handling mouse nests, dead mice, or mouse traps. Once everything has soaked for 10 minutes, remove all nest material, mice, and/or droppings with a damp towel and then mop or sponge the area with the disinfectant solution. Upholstered furniture and carpets can be shampooed and steam cleaned. If you wish to reuse the gloves used while cleaning contaminated areas, you must properly disinfect them before removal. After removing the gloves, it is important to thoroughly wash hands with soap and water or use a waterless alcohol-based hand sanitizer when soap is unavailable and hands aren’t visibly soiled. For more up-to-date information on rodent cleanup, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Web site.",
    "managementPestNote": "The California Fish and Game Code classifies deer mice as nongame mammals. Nongame mammals found injuring or threatening crops or other property may be controlled at any time in any legal manner by the owner or tenant of the premises. Effective management involves integrating several methods. Measures such as exclusion and sanitation or habitat modification can be applied to prevent infestations. When a mouse infestation already exists, population reduction by trapping and/or applying toxic bait is almost always necessary. Once a deer mouse population has been effectively controlled, it is important to monitor for signs of a reinfestation. Be aware of any signs of new activity. Signs of house mice activity look similar to those of deer mice; however, a telltale musky odor is typical of house mouse infestations. Exclusion Excluding deer mice from houses, dwellings, and other buildings by using rodent-proof construction is the most effective and permanent method to ensure the absence of deer mice and other rodent infestations in structures. Openings larger than 1/4 inch should be sealed, as mice will gnaw to enlarge these openings to gain entry. Steel wool makes a good temporary plug. Plastic screening, rubber, vinyl, insulating foam, wood, and other gnawable materials are unsuitable for plugging holes mice use. Seal cracks in building foundations and around openings for water pipes, vents, and utility cables with metal or concrete. Doors and door screens, pet doors, windows, ventilation screens, and entrances to garages, attics, crawl spaces, and basements should fit tightly. It may be necessary to cover the edges of doors and windows with metal to prevent gnawing. If doors, windows, vents, and screens are damaged beyond repair, replace them immediately. Fit chimneys with a spark arrester to help prevent entry. Self-closing flaps on external clothes dryer vents can prevent rodent entry. However, use caution when screening dryer vents, as a buildup of dryer lint can cause fires. Remember to keep side doors to the garage closed, especially at night when deer mice and other rodents are most active. Habitat Modification Simple habitat modification can make gardens and yards less hospitable for deer mice. Clearing overgrown shrubs, hedges, and weeds can dramatically reduce cover and potential refuges for deer mice. Wood and brush piles, along with fallen trees, should be kept away from homes and other buildings, as these are prime nesting areas that could harbor deer mice that may enter homes and other buildings. While habitat modification can reduce numbers of deer mice in an area, it won’t completely eliminate them, as a deer mouse’s home range is 1/3 acre to 4 or more acres. Frightening Devices and Repellents Commercially sold ultrasonic devices and other frightening devices aren’t effective at repelling deer mice. Chemical repellents, also commercially available for outdoor use, aren’t sufficiently effective to justify their expense. Trapping and Glue Boards Snap traps and electrocution traps can be used to remove deer mice that are found in or around buildings. Peanut butter or peanut butter mixed with cereal or rolled oats is usually an effective attractant. A dozen or more traps may be needed to effectively control a large population in a timely manner. It is important to keep some traps set after the initial control period to prevent reinvasion or resurgence of the deer mouse population. Trap placement is important. To maximize capture success, space traps no more than about 10 feet apart in areas where there is evidence of activity. Mice tend to run along walls, so if traps are placed at the juncture of a wall and the floor with the trigger pointed toward the wall, then the mouse will run directly across the trigger and very likely be caught. When trapping, take precautions to prevent possible exposure to hantavirus. Wear rubber, latex, vinyl, or nitrile gloves when removing traps, resetting used and older traps, and disposing of dead mice. Thoroughly wet contaminated areas including trapped deer mice, droppings, and nests with an appropriate disinfectant solution; see Hantavirus and Precautions above. While deer mice can be captured in several commercially available multiple-catch mouse traps, use of these traps isn’t recommended because of the greater potential for exposure to hantavirus. Live-capture traps quickly become contaminated with mouse feces and urine, and they also present the added problem of needing to humanely euthanize the trapped mice. Glue boards are sold commercially for controlling mice and rat populations. Mice that become stuck on glue boards often urinate and defecate as they struggle to free themselves from the glue. When deer mice are captured in this way, the potential for contacting hantavirus is greatly increased. Therefore, avoid glue boards for controlling deer mice. Biological Control Deer mice and other members of the genus Peromyscus are popular prey for many reptiles, birds, and predatory mammals. Collectively, snakes, owls, weasels, skunks, badgers, foxes, coyotes, and bobcats can consume large numbers of deer mice. However, such natural predation isn’t generally enough to control deer mouse populations to a low enough level to prevent damage or risk of exposure to hantavirus. Dogs and cats can catch and kill deer mice. However, it is unlikely they will effectively control deer mouse populations, and other control methods will be required. Cats may be able to control the reinfestation of deer mice once populations have been reduced or eliminated. However, in urban settings mice often live in close association with cats and dogs. Dog houses, sheds, and other shelter available within residential areas also provide refuge for some rodents, and food left out for pets as well as spillage from bird feeders often encourage rodent infestations. Toxicants (Rodenticides) Often, when a deer mouse population has become quite high, toxic bait (rodenticides) can serve as a valuable component of an IPM program for controlling these populations. Rodenticides can be divided into three different groups, according to the active ingredient:\tFirst-generation anticoagulants: warfarin, chlorophacinone, and diphacinone (only the second two are registered for use against deer mice);\tSecond-generation anticoagulants: brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone (none of which is registered for use against deer mice); and\tNonanticoagulants: bromethalin, cholecalciferol, and zinc phosphide (the latter being the only one registered for use against deer mice).\tAnticoagulants, when used as active ingredients in rodenticides, prevent blood from clotting and cause death as a result of internal bleeding. First-generation anticoagulants usually require multiple feedings over several days to acquire a lethal dose, so they are less likely to injure pets and nontarget wildlife than most other rodenticides. Second-generation anticoagulants have the same mode of action as first-generation anticoagulants but are substantially more toxic. In some species, they are fatal after only a single feeding. Even after death, anticoagulants can be stored in the tissues of the target animal. Because second-generation anticoagulants are highly toxic and remain active much longer in animal tissues, they aren’t registered for use against deer mice. Zinc phosphide is the only nonanticoagulant rodenticide registered for use against deer mice. Zinc phosphide produces phosphine gas in the stomach of the mouse after ingestion. Because phosphine gas is highly lethal to all animals, it kills after a single feeding. Rodenticides can poison nontarget animals (e.g., pets, domestic animals, and wildlife) either by direct consumption of toxic baits (primary exposure) or consumption of dead or dying rodents that have ingested toxic baits (secondary exposure). When using any rodenticide, follow label directions and take care to prevent accidental poisonings. Such risks can be reduced by exposing baits only within tamper-resistant bait stations and by locating and properly disposing of carcasses of poisoned rodents. Controlling deer mice in residential settings Although rodenticides are available for retail purchase to control house mice and rats, there are no toxic baits registered for controlling deer mice in residential settings. It is a violation of the product label to use rodent baits labeled for use “ only against house mice, Norway rats, and roof rats” in an attempt to control deer mice. Instead, residential deer mouse control should be accomplished by using traps, excluding mice from structures, and modifying the habitat to remove sources of food and shelter. If the deer mouse infestation is rather large and implementing effective control seems too daunting a task, consider hiring a professional licensed pest control operator with experience in rodent control. Controlling deer mice in agricultural settings Rodenticides containing first-generation anticoagulants are now restricted-use materials in agricultural fields and many noncrop settings, so only certified applicators can apply these materials. Broadcast applications of some first-generation anticoagulant baits (e.g., California Department of Food and Agriculture 0.01% chlorophacinone or 0.01% diphacinone-treated oats) are allowable for deer mouse control in specific agricultural and noncrop settings (e.g., dormant season applications in orchards and vineyards, roadsides, and ditch banks), although the label must be consulted to verify the legality and timing of their use for each situation. Some rodenticide products containing first-generation anticoagulants can be used in and around agricultural buildings such as livestock rearing facilities and dairies, when specified on the product’s label. Therefore, labels must be carefully consulted to verify the legality of using any product for deer mouse control. Applying first-generation anticoagulants inside such buildings may require a bait station if exposure to children, pets, or other nontarget animals is possible. Additionally, bait stations are required for all outdoor applications of rodenticide baits within 50 feet of any agricultural building. All residential use of agricultural baits is prohibited. Some rodenticides containing zinc phosphide are currently registered for use against deer mice in agricultural fields in California, although applications are primarily limited to orchards, groves, and vineyards. Because zinc phosphide baits sometimes aren’t well accepted by rodents, resulting in problems of bait shyness, and because hazards to nontarget species can sometimes occur, zinc phosphide baits should be used only by experienced applicators and in strict accordance with label directions.",

    "damagePestNote": "Rabbits can be very destructive in gardens and landscaped places. This is particularly true where wild or uncultivated lands border residential zones, parks, greenbelts, or other landscaped places. Open lands such as uncultivated, wild areas provide resting and hiding cover during the day within easy travel distances to prime, irrigated food sources. A partial list of crops and plants that rabbits damage:\tVegetables: beans, beet, broccoli, carrot, lettuce, and peas\tTree and berry crops: almond, apple, blackberry, cherry, citrus, pistachio, plum, raspberry, and strawberry\tHerbs: cilantro and parsley\tOrnamental plants: various flowers, shrubs, trees, and turf\tRabbits also gnaw and cut plastic irrigation lines, especially small diameter tubes. You can protect these by hanging them out of the reach of rabbits or by encasing them in regular 3/4-inch PVC pipe. Most rabbit damage is close to the ground, except where snow allows rabbits to reach higher portions of plants. Rabbits use their incisors to make a characteristic diagonal, 45° cut when clipping off woody twigs, buds from saplings, or flower heads. At first you might confuse a rabbit’s twig clipping with deer browsing. However, you easily can identify deer damage on woody plants if it occurs above a height that rabbits can reach—about 2 feet—and by carefully examining the damaged twigs. Deer have no upper front teeth and must twist and pull when browsing, leaving a ragged break on the branch. Rabbits clip twigs off cleanly, as if with a knife. Rabbits tend to gnaw the smooth, thin bark from young trees. The rough bark of older trees discourages gnawing, although old damage and gnaw marks often are present on old bark along with fresh patches of gnawing in areas of younger growth. Gnawing can completely girdle, or remove a ring of outer and inner bark from, a tree; clipping can remove the terminal shoot and lateral branches from plants. Damage by cottontails and brush rabbits often is concentrated in areas near escape cover. Jackrabbits, however, will feed far into open areas and can eat 1/2 to 1 pound of green vegetation each day. Rabbits can be carriers of tularemia, or rabbit fever. This disease is relatively rare in humans, but you can contract it by handling an infected rabbit with bare hands or by eating insufficiently cooked rabbit meat. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies jackrabbits, cottontails, and brush rabbits as game mammals. Under this code and a 2007 legal opinion, the owner or tenant of a property or an employee working on that person’s behalf can control jackrabbits, cottontails, and brush rabbits anytime or in any legal manner if the rabbits are damaging crops, landscaping, ornamental plants, or gardens. No license is required for the owner or tenant to take rabbits doing damage. A trapping license from the California Department of Fish and Game is required when trapping rabbits for hire or profit. When using firearms to take rabbits, nonlead ammunition must be used in areas within the historic California condor range; check with your local game warden for more information on these areas, and always check local ordinances before using firearms. It is illegal to sell the meat or fur of rabbits taken as pests.",
    "managementPestNote": "A number of methods are available for reducing rabbit damage, but physical exclusion, trapping, and—to a lesser degree—repellents are better choices for protecting garden and home areas. In cases where these methods aren’t practical, contact your local farm advisor or agricultural commissioner for more information. There are also professional pest control companies that will trap rabbits Exclusion Fencing Probably the most long-term, effective way to protect plantings from rabbit damage is to build a fence. Poultry netting (chicken wire) supported by light stakes will provide adequate control, although the mesh size should be no larger than 1 inch in order to exclude young rabbits. Use 48-inch-tall wire, and bury the bottom at least 6 to 10 inches into the ground. Bending a few inches of the fence bottom outwardly will further deter rabbits from digging beneath it. If you don’t bury the bottom of the wire fence, you’ll need to stake the bottom edge to deter rabbits from passing beneath it. Use tight-fitting gates with sills to keep rabbits from digging below the bottom rails. Keep gates closed as much as possible, because rabbits can be active day or night. Inspect the fence regularly to make sure rabbits or other animals haven’t dug beneath it. You can use reusable fence panels instead of a wire fence. Construct a wood lath or PVC frame 24 to 30 inches high. You can vary the length of the panels to match the size of the garden or area you want to protect. Attach 1-inch mesh wire to the frame, then wire the panels to lightweight, temporary fence posts. The low panels allow easy access for gardening, and you can move them when needed. Cottontails and brush rabbits won’t jump a 2-foot fence. Jackrabbits ordinarily won’t jump a 2-foot fence unless a dog chases them, or they become otherwise frightened. Discourage jumping by increasing the above-ground height to 3 feet. In snow areas, a higher fence might be necessary. Remember, once a rabbit gets into the fenced area, it might not be able to get out. Electric netting, a type of electric fence, also is suitable for rabbit control. It is designed for ease of installation and frequent repositioning. Electric netting is intended for temporary use at any one site, making it ideal for seasonal gardens. Because of the many variables affecting the selection of a power source and operation of an electric fence, it is best to consult a reputable dealer for specific details regarding its use. Trunk Guards In some cases protecting individual plants might be more practical than excluding rabbits from an entire area. Poultry netting with a 1-inch mesh and that is 18 to 24 inches wide is ideal for cutting into strips 18 to 20 inches long and forming into cylinders for placement around the trunks of young trees, shrubs, or vines. Bury the bottom of the cylinders 2 to 3 inches, and brace them away from the trunk, so rabbits can’t press against the cylinder and nibble through the mesh. Inspect these barriers regularly, and be sure to keep the area inside the barriers clean of leaves, weeds, and other debris to eliminate feeding sites for small rodents. Commercial tree trunk protectors also are available. Trapping Cottontail and brush rabbits are relatively easy to trap; however, jackrabbits are very difficult to capture, because they are reluctant to enter a confining space. Live trapping of cottontails and brush rabbits isn’t recommended, because it creates the dilemma of what to do with the trapped animal. Rabbits can carry certain diseases and are considered agricultural pests. According to California Fish and Game Code, it is illegal to release them in other areas without a written permit. Handling a live rabbit also creates the possible hazard of disease transmission to the trapper. You can trap cottontails and brush rabbits with a Conibear trap (No. 110), which kills the animal outright. Place the trap inside a covered box constructed from 3/4-inch exterior plywood with a 4-inch wide entrance. To further reduce hazards to children, pets, and poultry, position the trap back from the entrance. Slots at the back end of the box help in positioning the trap as does the hinged lid. The hole cut in the top of the hinged portion and covered with 1/4-inch mesh hardware cloth serves as a means to check the trap or bait. Other kill-type traps, such as a tunnel trap, also are available. Place traps near cover where the rabbits feed or rest. For bait, use whatever the rabbits are feeding on, or use carrots, cabbage, fresh green vegetables, or apples. Place the bait at the back of the trap. Placing some just outside the trap is helpful too. Check traps daily to replenish bait or remove the catch. Repellents Various chemical repellents can reduce or prevent rabbit damage. They are most useful when you apply them to trees, vines, or ornamentals. These products work by creating an unpleasant odor, taste, or stickiness. Research has shown that repellents with putrescent whole-egg solids can reduce rabbit browsing. Apply repellents before damage occurs, and reapply them frequently, especially after a rain, heavy dew, or sprinkler irrigation or when new growth occurs. In all cases, follow the label directions for the repellent you are using. The usefulness of repellents is limited. They work best to protect woody plants during the early years before they bear fruit or during winter. Most, except for some of the taste repellents, can’t be used on plants or plant parts that humans eat. Repellents usually fail when you use them in a vegetable garden, an area that contains highly preferred rabbit foods, even if the repellents are registered for use on edible crops. Habitat Management To discourage cottontails and brush rabbits, especially in suburban habitats where alternate habitats might be limited, remove brambles, piles of brush, stones, or other debris where rabbits can hide. Control vegetation along fence rows, ditch banks, or brushy areas. Keep in mind vegetation management can affect other wildlife such as songbirds. Removing cover probably will have little effect on jackrabbits, because they can use cover that often is great distances from their feeding sites. If outbuildings such as sheds, trailers, or other storage units are on slightly raised platforms of about 2 to 12 inches, construct a mesh barrier to exclude rabbits from hiding underneath. Other Control Methods Shooting can be an effective means of eliminating small numbers of rabbits where it is safe to do so in rural locations, but it is prohibited in urban and suburban locations. Best results are achieved in early morning or around dusk when rabbits are more active. Check both local and game regulations for license requirements and any restrictions on shooting in your area. “Frightening” devices, such as noisemakers and flashing lights, generally aren’t effective nor are ultrasonic units, which rely on sound waves to repel rabbits. A pet dog left loose within the area you want to protect can be somewhat effective in keeping rabbits away, but some dogs are better at this than others. Toxic baits are registered for use in agricultural situations to resolve serious crop damage problems when jackrabbits are numerous, but their use in urban and suburban situations isn’t practical. In order to comply with label instructions, you must recover all rabbits that die after coming into contact with the bait. Because the rabbits are likely to die outside the baited property, carcass recovery is almost impossible. Rabbits serve as food for a number of predators, including hawks and coyotes, but in urban and suburban situations, the greatest threat is from cats and dogs. Although relatively vulnerable to predators, rabbits generally cope well and maintain their populations in spite of this threat. FOLLOW-UP If you have built barriers to exclude rabbits, follow-up consists of regularly inspecting the area to ensure rabbits aren’t breaching them. Inspect previously undamaged plantings for new damage, as rabbits can switch to new food sources after you have excluded them from an existing feeding site. If trapping or shooting has reduced the rabbit population to a tolerable level, periodically search the area for signs of an increase in rabbits. Look for droppings, trails, and the characteristic 45° cut on twigs and stems. Rabbits are easy to see, but because they frequently feed when it is dark, you might have to examine the garden at night with a flashlight to see them. Their eyes shine yellow or red in a flashlight beam. Because few, if any, rabbits are acceptable in a garden or landscaped area, take appropriate action when you first observe signs of them. Rabbits seen nearby frequently will invade a garden when the plantings become desirable to them. Consider exclusion methods such as a fence before damage actually occurs.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Pocket gophers, Thomomys species, often simply called gophers, are burrowing rodents that get their name from the fur-lined, external cheek pouches, or pockets, they use for carrying food and nesting materials. Pocket gophers are well equipped for a digging, tunneling lifestyle with their powerfully built forequarters; large-clawed front paws; fine, short fur that doesn't cake in wet soils; small eyes and ears; and highly sensitive facial whiskers that assist with moving about in the dark. A gopher's lips are also unusually adapted for their lifestyle; they can close them behind their four large incisor teeth to keep dirt out of their mouths when using their teeth for digging.",

    "damagePestNote": "Pocket gophers often invade yards and gardens, feeding on many garden crops, ornamental plants, vines, shrubs, and trees. A single gopher moving down a garden row can inflict considerable damage in a very short time by pulling entire plants into their tunnel from below. In snow-covered regions, gophers can feed on bark (called girdling) several feet up a tree by burrowing through the snow, although most girdling damage to trunks and large roots occurs belowground.Gophers also gnaw and damage flexible plastic water lines and irrigation systems, particularly those types used for drip irrigation. Their tunnels can divert and carry off irrigation water, which leads to soil erosion. Mounds on lawns interfere with mowing equipment and ruin the aesthetics of well-kept turfgrass. LEGAL STATUS The California Department of Fish and Wildlife's Fish and Game Code classifies pocket gophers as nongame mammals. A trapping license is not required for gopher removal. They can be controlled at any time and in any legal manner.",
    "managementPestNote": "To successfully control gophers, the sooner you detect their presence and take control measures the better. Most people control gophers in lawns, gardens, or small orchards by trapping, by using poison baits or both. Exclusion Underground fencing might be justified for valuable ornamental shrubs or landscape trees. To protect existing plantings, bury hardware cloth or ½- to ¾-inch mesh wire at least 2 feet deep with an additional 6 inches of mesh or wire bent at a 90-degree angle away from the planting. This will help keep gophers from digging around the fencing boundary. Also, extend the fencing at least 1 foot aboveground to deter gophers moving overland. Use galvanized or stainless steel wire to extend the life of the fencing. This method is not perfect, because persistent gophers can burrow below the wire and the wire can restrict and damage root growth of trees. You can protect small areas such as flower beds by complete underground screening of the bed's sides and bottoms. When constructing raised vegetable or flower beds, underlay the soil with mesh wire to exclude gophers. To protect individual plants, install wire baskets, which you can make at home or buy commercially, at the same time you are putting the plants into the ground. Use light-gauge, ¾-inch, non-galvanized steel wire for shrubs and trees that will only need protection while young; the wire will rust and disintegrate after several years, preventing growing roots from becoming strangled. Choose baskets large enough to allow for the roots to grow for several years. Deter gophers by placing 6 to 8 inches of coarse gravel (1 inch or more in diameter) around underground flexible sprinkler lines or utility cables. Probing for Burrows Successful trapping, baiting, and burrow fumigation require accurate location of the gopher's main burrow. To locate the burrow, you need to use a gopher probe. Probes can come in many shapes and sizes, but essentially need to be long and durable enough to allow the user to identify gopher tunnel systems through 4 to 12 inches of hard soil. An enlarged tip that is wider than the shaft of the probe can be a useful design feature that increases the ease of locating burrows. However, many people use long screwdrivers to find tunnel systems. To find burrows, first locate areas of recent gopher activity based on fresh mounds of dark, moist soil. Fresh mounds that are visible aboveground are the plugged openings of lateral tunnels. You can find the main burrow by probing about 4 to 12 inches from the plug side of the mound; it is usually located 4 to 12 inches deep. When the probe penetrates the gopher's burrow, there will be a sudden, noticeable drop of about 2 inches. You might have to probe repeatedly to locate the gopher's main burrow, but your skill will improve with experience. Because the gopher might not revisit lateral tunnels, trapping and baiting them is not as successful as in the main burrow. Learn how to locate fresh mounds and gopher burrows in this video called \" Finding Gopher Tunnel Systems.\" Trapping Trapping is a safe and effective method for controlling pocket gophers. Several types and brands of lethal gopher traps are available. Most common are 2-pronged pincer traps, such as the Macabee, Cinch, or Gophinator, which the gopher triggers when it pushes against a flat, vertical pan or metal wire. Another popular type is the choker-style box trap. More recently, the Gopherhawk has been developed which is a choker-style trap that allows for direct insertion into the gopher burrow. At this time, little is known about the efficacy of this trap type. To set pincer and box traps, locate the main tunnel with a probe, as described above. Use a shovel, garden trowel, or hori hori knife to open the tunnel wide enough to set traps. You will need to set traps in as many tunnels as are present since you will not know which portion of the tunnel the gopher is in. Some consider box traps to be easier to use than pincer-style traps for inexperienced gopher trappers. However, setting box traps in the main tunnel requires more surface excavation than the pincer-type traps, which is an important consideration in lawns and some gardens. Most experienced trappers find pincer traps easier to use. Of these, the Gophinator trap can be more effective than the Macabee in catching larger, mature gophers. Although some advocate for the use of bait behind the trap to increase capture success, UC Davis researchers have observed no such benefit. There is also no impact of human scent on trapping success. Once traps are set, be sure to wire your traps to stakes so you can easily retrieve them from the burrow, and to prevent scavengers from carrying them away. After setting the traps, you can exclude light from the burrow by covering the opening with dirt clods, sod, canvas or landscape cloth, cardboard, or plywood. You can sift fine soil around the edges of these covers to ensure a light-tight seal. Alternatively, you can leave the trap-sets uncovered, thereby encouraging gophers to visit these trap sites as they seek out these openings to plug; gophers do not like open burrow systems. There does not appear to be much advantage to covering trap-sets other than to eliminate access to humans and other nontarget animals. Leaving trap-sets uncovered will allow you to set traps more quickly and check them more easily. However, you should always cover trap-sets when trapping in areas frequented by humans and pets. In general, it is recommended that you cover sets when using box traps, since gophers likely will plug tunnels before hitting the trigger wire of these traps if you leave them uncovered. However, some trappers prefer to leave box traps uncovered when setting in lateral tunnels to encourage investigation by the gopher. Check traps often and reset when necessary. If you haven't captured a gopher within 1 to 2 days, reset the traps in a different location. Natural Controls Because no population will increase indefinitely, one alternative to a gopher problem is to do nothing, letting the population limit itself. Experience has shown, however, that by the time gopher populations level off naturally, they've already caused much damage around homes, gardens, parks, or athletic fields. Predators—including owls, snakes, cats, dogs, and coyotes—eat pocket gophers. Predators rarely remove every prey animal but instead move on to hunt at more profitable locations. In addition, gophers have defenses against predators. For example, they can escape snakes in their burrows by rapidly pushing up an earthen plug to block the snake's advance. Relying solely on natural predators might not control gophers to the desired level. Some people have tried attracting barn owls to an area by installing nest boxes. Although barn owls prey on gophers, their habit of hunting over large areas, often far from their nest boxes, and their tendency to hunt areas with the most abundant prey, make them unreliable for gopher control, particularly over small areas such as a yard. When a single gopher, which is capable of causing damage rapidly, invades a yard or garden, a gardener can't afford to wait for an owl to arrive. It is better to immediately take effective action, usually through trapping or perhaps baiting. Habitat Modification Reducing gopher food sources using either chemical or mechanical methods can decrease the attractiveness of lawns and gardens to gophers. If feasible, remove weedy areas adjacent to yards and gardens to create a buffer strip of unsuitable habitat. Baiting with Toxic Baits The key to an effective toxic baiting program is bait placement. Always place pocket gopher bait in the main underground tunnel, not the lateral tunnels. After locating the main gopher tunnel with a probe, enlarge the opening by rotating the probe or inserting a larger rod or stick. Following label directions, place the bait carefully in the opening using a spoon or other suitable implement that you use only for that purpose, taking care not to spill any onto the ground. A funnel is useful for preventing spillage. Often, a back-filled (plugged) tunnel—one a gopher has filled with loose dirt—will feel similar to an active tunnel. Experience is required to tell the difference. New probe users might benefit from digging down to confirm that the tunnel is active or plugged. If it is an active tunnel, you can apply bait to both of the tunnel's sides before closing it up. If it is plugged, don't treat. Once you are comfortable with your ability to accurately determine active tunnels, you can follow the standard baiting protocols described below. Strychnine-treated grain is the most effective type of bait used for pocket gopher control. This bait generally contains 0.5% strychnine and is lethal with a single feeding. Baits containing 2.0% zinc phosphide are also available. As with strychnine, these baits are lethal after a single feeding. Multiple-feed anticoagulants (chlorophacinone and diphacinone) are available as well. When using anticoagulant baits, you'll need to apply a large amount of bait—about 10 times the amount needed when using strychnine baits, perhaps requiring multiple applications—so enough will be available for multiple feedings. Although generally less effective than strychnine baits, anticoagulant baits are less toxic after ingestion of a single dose, and have an antidote available. As such, they are preferred in areas where children and pets might be present. When using either type of bait, be sure to follow all label directions and precautions. Be sure to clean up any bait spilled aboveground, as it could be hazardous to desirable wildlife and pets. It is important to remember that bait application for gophers is only allowed directly within burrow systems; above ground application is illegal and ineffective and may expose pets and nontarget wildlife to poison bait. Bait application should not be made in gardens with root vegetables as these vegetables could come into direct contact with the bait and expose people to the pesticide. After placing the bait in the main tunnel, close the probe hole with sod, rocks, or some other material that excludes light while preventing dirt from falling on the bait. Several bait placements within a burrow system will increase success. Tamp down or clear existing mounds so you can distinguish new activity. If new mounds appear more than 2 days after strychnine or zinc phosphide baiting or 7 to 10 days after using anticoagulant baits, you'll need to rebait or try trapping. If gophers have infested a large area, use a hand-held bait applicator to speed treatment. Bait applicators are a combination probe and bait reservoir. Once you have located a tunnel using the probe, a trigger releases a measured amount of bait into the tunnel. Applicators are often used only with strychnine or zinc phosphide bait, given that the applicators only dispense a small quantity of bait at a time. Fumigation Fumigation with smoke or gas cartridges usually isn't effective, because gophers quickly seal off their burrow when they detect smoke or gas. However, fumigation with aluminum phosphide, a restricted-use application requiring a state license, is effective at controlling gopher populations. Licensed pest control operators have access to aluminum phosphide, so if trapping and baiting aren't effective, you may consider hiring a professional. Be aware that new regulations greatly restrict the use of aluminum phosphide in residential areas. Applications can only be made within burrow systems located more than 100 feet from any building where humans, domestic animals, or both are or may potentially be found. Within residential areas, aluminum phosphide can only be applied in parks and athletic fields. As such, it likely won't be available for use on most residential properties. In 2012, pressurized exhaust machines were approved for use against burrowing rodents in California. As their name implies, these devices generate exhaust rich in carbon monoxide. This exhaust is injected into the burrow system, asphyxiating the gopher. Several products are available on the market including the Pressurized Exhaust Rodent Controller (PERC), BurrowRx, Cheetah rodent control machine, and the CO-Jack. These machines are relatively effective, with removal rates in excess of 70% observed in some settings for the PERC machine. However, the machines are expensive and are likely only practical for individuals involved in large-scale gopher management. Other Control Methods Pocket gophers can easily withstand normal garden or home landscape irrigation, but you can sometimes use flooding to force them from their burrows, enabling you to use a shovel or a dog to kill the rodent. Gas explosive devices are also available, but they are only somewhat effective at controlling gopher populations. These devices ignite a mixture of propane and oxygen in the burrow system. This concussive force kills the gopher and destroys the burrow system. Be sure to exercise caution when using these devices because of the potential for unintended damage to property, injury to users and bystanders, potential for starting fires in dry environments, and destruction of turf. Be aware that these devices are quite loud, making them unsuita-ble in residential areas. Other approaches tend to be significantly more effective. No repellents have proven effective at protecting gardens or other plantings from pocket gophers. Plants such as gopher purge, Euphorbia lathyrus, castor bean, Ricinus communis, and garlic have been suggested as repellents, but research has not substantiated these claims. Although many devices designed to frighten pocket gophers are commercially available—including vibrating stakes, ultrasonic devices, and wind-powered pinwheels—these rodents don't frighten easily, probably because of their repeated exposure to noise and vibrations from sprinklers, lawnmowers, vehicles, and people moving about. Another ineffective control method is placing chewing gum or laxatives in burrows in hopes of killing gophers. Follow-up Once you have controlled pocket gophers, monitor the area on a regular basis for reinfestation. Level all existing mounds after the control program, and clean away weeds and garden debris, so you can easily see fresh mounds. It is important to check regularly for reinfestation, because pocket gophers can move in from other areas, and damage can reoccur in a short time. If your property borders wildlands, vacant lots, or other areas that serve as a source of gophers, you can expect gophers to reinvade regularly. Be prepared to take immediate control action when they do. It is easier, cheaper, and less time consuming to control one or two gophers than to wait until the population builds up to the point where they cause excessive damage.

    "damagePestNote": "Opossums are considered a nuisance in gardens and near homes where they feed on berries, grapes, tree fruits and nuts, and defecate on garden paths and patios. They get into fights with dogs and cats and can inflict serious injury with their mouthful of sharp pointed teeth. Opossums carry diseases such as leptospirosis, tuberculosis, relapsing fever, tularemia, spotted fever, toxoplasmosis, coccidiosis, trichomoniasis, and Chagas disease. They may also be infested with fleas, ticks, mites, and lice. Opossums are hosts for cat and dog fleas, especially in urban environments. This flea infestation on opossums is particularly concerning for transmission of flea-borne typhus, which is increasing in prevalence in Orange and Los Angeles Counties. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies opossums as nongame mammals. If you find opossums threatening growing crops or other property of which you are the owner or tenant, you may control the opossum using any legal means. California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulations prohibit the relocation of wildlife without written permission from the department. Check to make sure there are no municipal or county restrictions pertaining to the removal of opossums prior to taking any action.",
    "managementPestNote": "Control methods for opossums are the same or similar to those for skunks and raccoons. Opossums do not usually become as numerous as raccoons and are not as objectionable as skunks. Opossums are highly adaptable and are great survivors. Once they have invaded a neighborhood they are probably there to stay so long as food, water, and shelter are available. Detection Because they are only active at night and low-light hours, opossums might never be seen as they travel through neighborhoods or yards. Barking dogs and disappearing pet food left out overnight may be the first apparent clues. Sometimes strange-looking droppings (scat) may be found on garden paths, walkways, and patios, though typically opossums defecate in protected and leafy areas. The scat is difficult to describe as the omnivorous eating habits of the animal preclude an average size, shape, or texture. Since opossums are messy feeders, you may find remnants of the previous night's foraging and feeding. An occasional visit by an opossum or a family of opossums may not present cause for concern unless you have pets that remain outdoors at night. Pet and opossum confrontations are relatively common and the pets are often injured. Early action may be warranted to avoid such a problem. Habitat Modification The aim of habitat modification is to make your premises less appealing to the opossum. Cut back overgrown shrubbery and trim back trees that overhang rooftops at least 5 feet from the roof edge. Continually remove any fallen fruit, which will be readily fed upon by opossums. Be sure firewood is stacked tightly, leaving no major gaps suitable for a den. Store scrap lumber and other items in an orderly manner, preferably about 18 inches off the ground. Ensure garbage cans have tight-fitting lids and do not place food items or table scraps in your compost bin. Pet food placed outdoors should be removed by nightfall. This will substantially reduce or eliminate the potential negative interactions between pets and opossums. Exclusion As with skunks and raccoons, the best solution to an opossum’s presence beneath stairs, porches, decks, or buildings is to screen or block access to the area. Close off all potential entrances or openings under the house, garden tool shed, mobile home, deck, etc. with 1/4–inch mesh hardware cloth. The advantage of using the small mesh is that it will also exclude rats and house mice. When possible, bury the hardware cloth up to 6 inches to deter the opossum from crawling or digging underneath the exclusionary structure. Once an opossum has taken up residence beneath a building or deck, you have to be sure the animal has left before blocking the opening. A fairly easy way to make this determination is to sprinkle a smooth layer of flour about 1/8–inch thick just in front of the point of entrance to form a tracking patch, in which the animal’s footprints will be evident. Examine the tracking patch soon after dark; the presence of footprints will indicate the animal has left and the opening can then be closed off. Normally opossums live alone except when with young and then, since the young remain in the pouch, they leave with the mother. Exclusion of opossums from gardens can be accomplished with a fence built of poultry wire. The fence should be 4 feet high with the top 12 to 18 inches of the fence bent outward, away from the garden, and not attached to any support. Since the top of the fence is not rigid and bends under the weight of the animal, it cannot be climbed over. As an alternative, any standard wire fence can be made opossum proof by stretching a parallel electrically-charged wire near the top of the fence, 3 inches out from the mesh. A cattle-type electric fence charger activates the wire. A similar approach can be used to prevent opossums from climbing trees. More electric fence details are provided in Pest Notes: Raccoons . Trapping Opossums are not wary of traps and can easily be caught with a box- or cage-type live-catch trap. Traps should be at least 10 x 12 x 32 inches in size and set along trails or known routes of travel. Fish-flavored canned cat food works well as trap bait but often attracts cats as well. To avoid this possibility, try using whole raw chicken eggs or jam or peanut butter spread on a bit of bread. Other baits can include overripe fruit such as grapes, bananas, or melons. Live-trapping presents the problem of dealing with the animal once captured. Since it is illegal to relocate an opossum without a permit, those not wanting to deal with its disposal may prefer to hire a professional wildlife control operator. They are equipped to handle problem wildlife in a legal and humane manner. If the trapper is willing to dispatch the animal, shooting and the use of a carbon dioxide gas chamber are the only acceptable forms of euthanasia. Shooting is the simplest approach, but firearm discharge is not allowable in most residential areas. In these areas, a carbon dioxide gas chamber is the only option. Details on carbon dioxide euthanasia are available online from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and Cornell University (see References). Drowning is illegal in California as a form of euthanasia. Other Control Methods A motion-activated sprinkler device sometimes induces a fright response in opossums, skunks, and raccoons. If the animal has established the habit of visiting the yard or garden, such frightening responses rarely last for more than a few days. A greater effect is observed on animals that have not habituated to the site. An array of chemical products is marketed for repelling various wildlife species but, unfortunately, none offer significant results for opossums. The odor of mothballs, naphthalene crystals, or household ammonia has been used as a home remedy repellent. However, the use of these products in this manner is not legal, nor are they recommended, given the potential for these fumes to enter buildings. These chemicals may also build up toxicity in the soil thereby posing an additional threat. There are no registered toxicants for poisoning opossums. Poison baits sold for the control of rodents should never be used in an attempt to control opossums, skunks, or raccoons. The penalty for such pesticide misuse can be substantial, and the practice usually becomes known as a result of the accidental poisoning of someone’s pet. In rural areas where it is legal and safe to do so, opossums may be spotlighted at night and shot during much of the year. However, be aware that spotlighting is not allowed during the deer hunting season.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The mole, Scapanus species, is a small insect-eating mammal. Contrary to a commonly held belief, it isn't part of the rodent family. In California, moles inhabit the Sierra Nevada, coastal range mountains and foothills, and the entire coastal zone. They aren't usually found in the dry southeastern regions of the state or in much of the Central Valley, except for moist areas where the soil is rich in humus, such as riverbanks. Moles live almost entirely underground in a vast network of interconnecting tunnels. They frequently create shallow tunnels just below the surface where they capture worms, insects, and other invertebrates. They may infrequently consume roots, bulbs, and other plant material, although rodent species (e.g., pocket gophers, meadow voles, and deer mice) are almost always the cause of such chewing damage. By far the greatest damage from moles occurs through their burrowing activity, which dislodges plants and dries out their roots. In lawns, the resulting mounds and ridges are unsightly and disfiguring. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Moles have cylindrical bodies with slender, pointed snouts and short, bare, or sparsely haired tails. Their limbs are short and spadelike. Their eyes are poorly developed, and their ears aren't visible. The fur is short, dense, and velvety. Moles typically have one litter of three to four young per year. Because moles are antisocial, you will find only one mole per tunnel, except during the breeding season, which typically occurs during later winter through early spring. Mounds and surface runways are obvious indicators of the presence of moles. The mounds are formed when moles push up soil to the surface from underground runways. The excavated soil may be in small chunks, and single mounds often appear in a line over the runway connecting them. Surface feeding burrows appear as ridges that the mole pushes up by forcing its way through the soil. Some of the surface runways are temporary. More permanent tunnels are deeper underground and are usually about 2 inches in diameter and 8 to 12 inches below the surface. Moles are active throughout the year, although surface activity slows or is absent during periods of extreme cold, heat, or drought. Greatest mole activity occurs usually after rainfall or watering events when digging new tunnels is easiest. LEGAL STATUS The California Fish and Game Code classifies moles as nongame mammals. If moles threaten growing crops or other property, the owner or tenant may control the moles using any legal means.",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Moles can cause significant problems in landscape or garden areas, especially in turf. Because mole damage can be unsightly, makes lawn maintenance difficult, and destroys valuable plants, the number of moles that can be tolerated is usually quite low, sometimes even zero. As soon as you see an active mound or surface runway, initiate appropriate control actions. Once you have controlled damage, establish a system to monitor for reinfestation. Several methods of control are available, but no single method has proven fail-proof, so it may be necessary to use a combination of techniques. Trapping Trapping is the most universally applicable and dependable method of mole control. Several different kinds of mole traps are available at hardware stores, nurseries, or directly from the manufacturer. Keep in mind that the best mole traps differ from those for pocket gophers; very few traps are effective for both animals. Understanding mole behavior helps improve the efficacy of trapping. To be effective, the trap must be set to catch the mole underground. When a mole's sensitive snout encounters a foreign object in the burrow, the mole is likely to plug off that portion and dig around or under the object. Therefore, traps should be set to straddle or encircle the tunnel or be suspended above it. Moles are undeterred by soil blocks in the tunnel, which occur naturally from cave-ins, and will continue digging through them rather than around them. The upward pressure of the mole's body or the movement of soil against a triggering plate springs the trap. Moles are active throughout the year and can be trapped at any time. Before setting mole traps, determine which runways are currently in use. Moles dig a system of deep tunnels that are more or less permanently used as well as a network of surface runs used for feeding. Some of the surface tunnels are only temporary, so they may not make a good trap set. Moles are more likely to be trapped in the deep runways, which they reuse almost permanently. To determine where moles are active, tamp down short sections of surface runways and mounds. Observe these areas daily and retamp any raised sections, making note of the areas of activity. Selecting a frequently used runway is very important to the success of your control efforts. Set traps at least 18 inches from a mound and only in those runways moles use frequently. You can locate deeper tunnels by probing between or next to a fresh mound with a pointed stick, slender metal rod, or gopher probe. When the earth suddenly gives way, the probe has probably broken through the burrow. Mole traps are fairly expensive, so most people tend to buy only one. Although one trap may solve the problem, increasing the number of traps will increase the speed and overall success of the trapping program. In California, two major types of mole traps are most commonly used. These are the harpoon type and the scissor-jaw type. Moles have sometimes been caught with certain pincer-type gopher traps set in mole runways, but these are rarely as effective as the harpoon or scissor-jaw mole traps. Trap manufacturers often provide detailed instructions, which should be followed carefully. Set the scissor-jaw trap in the mole's main underground tunnel, which is usually 8 to 12 inches below the surface. Using a garden trowel or small shovel, remove a section of soil slightly larger than the trap width, about 6 inches. Build a plug of soil in the center of the opened runway for the trigger pan to rest on. Moist soil from the opened tunnel or from a nearby fresh mound can be squeezed together to build the plug. With the safety catch in place, set the trap and wedge it firmly into the opened burrow with the trigger placed snugly against the top of the soil plug. Next, scatter loose soil onto the set trap to about the level of the top of the tunnel. This excludes light from the opened burrow and probably makes the mole less suspicious of the plugged tunnel. Release the safety catch, and the trap is completely set. The harpoon trap will work in deeper tunnels if you set it on a soil plug as described for the scissor-jaw trap. It can also be set on the surface over an active runway ridge that has been pressed down under the trigger pan. Repellents Many home remedies have been suggested to solve mole problems. These remedies include placing irritating materials such as broken glass, razor blades, thorny rose bush branches, bleach, mothballs, lye, castor oil, and even human hair in the burrow in an effort to drive moles away. \"Frightening\" devices such as mole wheels, vibrating windmills, and whistling bottles are also commonly recommended in garden literature as repellent techniques. Some garden literature advises using the gopher and mole plant, Euphorbia lathyris, as a repellent. Various electrical devices that vibrate soil, produce sound, or do both are frequently advertised for mole control, but research doesn't support their effectiveness. None of these approaches has proved successful in stopping mole damage or in driving moles from an area. Commercially available mole repellents, usually castor oil solutions, are also available. Research on the effectiveness of these castor oil commercial repellents has shown some efficacy for eastern moles. No research has been done on moles in the western United States, so their effectiveness on these species remains unclear. However, repellents work by moving animals from one location to another by deterring their presence in the area where the repellent is applied. As such, they may have limited utility in residential areas, as \"repelled\" moles will simply move to neighboring lawns and gardens and will continue to cause damage in these areas. Toxic Baits Because the mole's main diet consists of earthworms and insects, poisoning with traditional grain-based baits is rarely effective. However, several new forms of toxic control have been developed that better mimic the moles natural food source. One example is a new gel-type warfarin anticoagulant bait (Kaput Mole Gel Bait, Scimetrics Ltd. Corp.) that is squeezed directly into the tunnel. Another example is a worm-shaped gel containing bromethalin (Talpirid, Bell Laboratories Inc.) that can be placed directly into the tunnel. Although rigorous testing is still needed to better estimate their effectiveness, limited studies have indicated these gel-type baits are more efficacious than grain baits and appear to be a viable alternative for mole control. Be sure to follow label instructions when applying these baits. Other Control Methods Some gardeners have found that moles can be detected by watching for \"moving\" ridges, which appear when moles are digging surface runs. If you can see such movements, try using a shovel or other garden tool to dislodge and dispatch the animal. Installing a vertical underground barrier may provide temporary relief. To protect existing plantings, bury hardware cloth or 1/4-inch wire mesh in a 6-inch wide trench at least 2 feet deep with an additional 6-inch lip of mesh bent at a 90-degree angle away from the planting. This lip will help deter moles from digging under the fencing. A small length (about 6 inches) of fencing should protrude aboveground to eliminate aboveground dispersal into the exclusion area. Burying wire can be difficult and time consuming, so galvanized or stainless steel wire is recommended to prolong the life of the fence. Exclusionary fencing is not perfect, however, as persistent moles can eventually find a way to burrow around the fencing. Eventually, removal techniques may be required to eliminate moles that find their way into exclusion areas. Alternative exclusion approaches include wire-mesh baskets that will prevent moles from heaving planted bulbs out of the ground and wire mesh bottoms in raised beds, which will totally exclude moles. Attempting to flood tunnels with water to drown moles or force them to the surface for dispatch isn't recommended. Flooding is typically ineffective and wastes water, as moles have deep and extensive burrow systems that require much water to fill.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Deer are one of the California’s most visible and widespread wildlife species. Found throughout more than two thirds of California, they have historically been one of the state’s most popular game animals. While some deer populations have declined in recent decades, deer conflicts in residential and agricultural settings remain major problems and have even increased in some localities. Deer can be very destructive to home gardens, ornamental landscape plants, orchards, and vineyards. In some situations, deer may inhibit efforts to restore native vegetation. BIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR Mule deer, Odocoileus hemionus, and Columbian black-tailed deer, O. hemionus columbianus, are the two types of deer native to California. The smaller Columbian black-tailed deer is considered a subspecies of mule deer and is generally found along the Pacific Coast from San Luis Obispo County northward into Oregon and gradually more inland into Northern California. Mule deer are found in California from south to north along the eastern side of the San Joaquin Valley northward through the Sierra Nevada Range and its foothills, extending to the Oregon border. Generally, black-tailed deer establish resident populations while mule deer tend to be migratory according to season and food availability. Deer populations in some areas of California may be declining for various reasons. However, deer numbers at the suburban-wildland interface, and even within some residential environments, have increased in many localities; perhaps a result of increased food availability from irrigated landscape plantings and because of reduced risk of predation.\tDeer are browsers, preferring to consume a diet high in semi-woody materials (specifically the terminal and lateral buds of shrubs and trees), but will also eat a variety of vegetation including grasses and forbs (small broadleaved flowering plants). Deer also consume fruit, nut, and ornamental trees, shrubs, vines, and garden vegetables. In areas of native oak trees, a distinct browse line often can be observed, as deer will consume all green leaves and newer small stems as high as they can reach, usually to a height of about 4 to 5 feet.",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damagePestNote": "Deer usually feed in the late evening and very early morning, so it is not easy to observe them. However, in suburban areas where deer have become accustomed to people, they may be active throughout the day. When deer browse on leaves and tender stems of shrubs and trees, they leave ragged edges on remaining plant parts. Highly palatable plants, like roses and apple trees, are often planted around homes for landscaping and gardens, attracting deer and sometimes sustaining severe damage. Deer browsing can stunt the growth of newly planted fruit and nut trees and vines, sometimes delaying their fruit production by several years. Additionally, deer can completely consume or trample leafy vegetables, legumes, ground covers, and flowers. In mid to late summer, bucks (male deer) will rub their antlers on tree trunks and limbs, fence posts, and other rough surfaces to remove their shedding velvet (the vascular skin that covers antlers while they are growing). While this is not a problem for larger trees, saplings or small limbs can be badly damaged or destroyed. Presence of deer in the garden or orchard can be detected by finding hoof prints or droppings. LEGAL STATUS California’s native deer are game animals, with regulated seasonal hunting that varies among the state’s deer management units. Legal sport harvest of deer requires a hunting license as well as purchase of deer tags from the California Department of Fish & Wildlife (CDFW). When verifiable damage is occurring to crops or other resources, the CDFW has authority to issue a depredation permit to allow the lethal removal of deer. Non-lethal methods of preventing or controlling deer damage are usually recommended first, with lethal control via depredation permit considered as a last resort.",
    "managementPestNote": "Habitat Modification—Creating Deer-Resistant Landscapes Most traditional gardens and landscapes in California are highly attractive to deer and have little resistance to deer browsing. In many circumstances, gardens attract deer because other natural food sources are out of season or otherwise unavailable. The plants most resistant to deer browsing are those that contain toxins of some type, such as oleander, which is poisonous to most mammals. Some plants may be toxic or repellent only during certain stages of growth, so they may be considered deer-resistant in some seasons but not others. Many plants that are found on lists of deer-resistant plants will simply be less palatable or less preferred, but when food is scarce (particularly in drought years), deer are numerous, or both, they will be eaten. Several published lists of deer-resistant plants are available and can be used as general guides (see References). Plants avoided by deer in one region of California may be readily consumed in other regions. Realize that not all plants on such lists are going to be deer-resistant in every situation. Talk to neighbors about what has worked for them in the recent past. Deer damage differs according to location, time of year, plant age, weather, and deer numbers, so it may be prudent to employ a trial-and-error approach before investing heavily in new plantings. You might choose a few plants you’re considering, but leave them in their pots and place them in the area where you want to plant. Watch them for a few days to see if deer begin feeding on them. Be flexible about your choices. Exclusion/Fencing Properly built and maintained fencing is the most effective method for preventing deer damage. Fencing may require high initial financial investment but, considered over time, may prove to be the most cost-effective approach. The kind of fence you build depends on the cost, terrain, and your needs. Both high-tensile wire and woven mesh, full-height fences are effective. Deer are more likely to crawl under or through a fence than jump over it. Make sure you secure the fence close to the ground and repair any breaks. For gardens that approach a quarter acre in size, the best conventional fence material is 4-inch woven wire. A smaller mesh, or fencing with graduated mesh that is smaller toward the bottom, can be substituted if smaller pests such as rabbits and hares also need to be excluded. Deer normally will not jump a 6-foot fence; but if chased or threatened, they can clear an 8-foot fence on level ground. Because of this ability, a 7- or 8-foot fence is recommended, especially where mule deer are found. On sloping ground, you may need to build fences 10 or 11 feet high to guard against deer jumping down slope. Fence gates should be equal to the height of the fence, and they must be kept closed to prevent deer from entering the fenced area. A good deer fence is built to work in both directions: if an animal gets in, you will need to have a way to get the deer out without difficulty. A removable section in an uphill corner on sloping ground or a corner farthest from human activity, if on level ground, can be very helpful in allowing deer to be driven out of the fenced area. An extra strand of wire stretched along the ground of a conventional fence will help prevent deer from crawling under the fence. Stake the wire or mesh firmly to the ground in any depressions between posts, or fill the depressions with materials that will not deteriorate or wash away. If you need to economize, you can stretch two or more strands of 9- or 10-gauge smooth wire spaced 4 to 6 inches apart above a 6-foot mesh fence to make it higher. There is no advantage to using barbed wire for these top strands. In order for the wire to remain tight, the vertical stays on mesh fences should be no more than 6 to 8 feet apart. A slanted fence can be built with similar materials as conventional fences, but it will not need to be as high. As deer approach the outward-sloping fence, they come under the overhang, which discourages them from trying to jump over. High-tensile wire fences are less expensive and can be very effective, although their construction requires special techniques. For more information on various types of fences, see the reference by VerCauteren et al., contact an agricultural fencing contractor, or visit your local UC Cooperative Extension advisor. Fencing Riparian Corridors. Historically, many streamside (riparian) corridors have been damaged and altered by gravel extraction, excessive use by livestock, and other human activities. Restoration of streamside vegetation will stabilize streambanks, reducing erosion and siltation and significantly improving fisheries habitats. Continuing significant impacts of deer browsing in riparian areas is often not fully recognized until exclusion fencing is installed along sections of stream to prevent deer impacts. Often, even without re-planting, vegetative recovery is rapid and visually apparent within a few years. Constructing deer-proof fencing along riparian corridors, or modifying existing livestock fencing to also exclude deer, can be a very cost-effective technique in restoring riparian ecosystems. Once the vegetation is re-established the fence can be used to manage grazing, if that is desired. Converting an Existing Fence. To convert an existing fence, attach uprights vertically or at an angle sloping away from the area you want to protect. Fasten mesh wire or smooth wires above the fence with no more than 4 to 6 inches between them. Most fences can be made deer-proof with an upright extension of 3 or 4 feet, provided the lower portion is well constructed and fitted tightly to the ground. Electric Fences . Standard electric fences used for livestock have not proven very effective for deer control in California. However, the New Zealand-type high voltage electric fence, built specifically for deer with its high-tensile-strength wire and more intense charge, may be effective. Electric fences are significantly less costly to construct than conventional woven wire fences, but they require more routine monitoring and maintenance to make sure they are functioning; they can short out when contacted by vegetation, when a wire slips off an insulator, or when a tree branch falls and causes two wires to come into contact with each other. Poly-tape and poly-twine fences are temporary, portable electric fences used for confining livestock in small plots. These may be effective at excluding deer from seasonal gardens or from newly-planted landscaping, especially when installed before deer develop a habit of feeding in a particular location. Temporary Fences. Individual Plant Protectors. In many places, protecting individual plants may be more practical and economical than fencing an entire area. For example, young fruit or nut trees in a home orchard can be individually fenced until primary branches grow above the deer’s reach. Poultry wire, heavier woven wire, or strong plastic netting can be attached to two stakes to form a circle around the tree. If you are also seeking to prevent rabbit or rodent damage to the new tree or vine, use a smaller mesh size as appropriate. Plastic trunk protectors are especially useful. Inspect individual protectors regularly because they can restrict plant growth. In addition, care must be taken to ensure the protector itself does not damage the vine or tree by causing an accumulation of excess heat or moisture. Frightening and Behavioral Change Use of noise, visual objects, or other frightening devices to keep deer away from desirable food items are usually effective for only a few days, if at all. In urban and suburban residential areas, deer come into contact with a variety of changing auditory and visual stimuli daily and often quickly habituate to things that cause them no harm. Even in rural areas, electronic or mechanical noisemakers that periodically discharge sound (for example, propane cannons and electronic alarms) typically work only for short periods of time. Some home gardeners have had better success with motion-activated devices that emit stimuli when deer come into range of their motion detector. Motion-activated sprinklers may be effective in some situations for a given period of time. Some landowners with small orchards, vineyards, and gardens have reported solving deer damage by using dogs trained to stay within an invisible fence system installed around the periphery of the plantings. As with repellents (below), it is difficult to predict accurately where and for how long frightening strategies may work. Repellents Various chemical repellents are sold for reducing or preventing deer damage to plants, although their effectiveness in most situations is not very good or long lasting. Deer repellents are designed to impart objectionable odors or tastes. Studies suggest that repellents containing fermented egg compounds are more effective than other repellents. Most repellents are not allowed on edible food crops, but can sometimes be used during the dormant season or when fruit is not present; check the product label to determine its approved uses. Some repellents can be injurious to certain trees or shrubs, especially to the new growth. If in doubt, test the repellent on a single plant to make sure it is not harmful to the plant. When choosing a deer repellent, read the label carefully to find out if its use is permissible for your situation. Be sure the repellent is registered for your intended plant and season. Always follow product label directions. Repellents should be applied before damage occurs and must be reapplied frequently, especially after a rain, heavy dew, or sprinkler irrigation. To be effective, repellents must usually be applied to new foliage as it develops. When repellents succeed in protecting plants, it is usually because they have significantly reduced the plant’s palatability to deer, thus causing deer to choose alternative foods. Repellents are unlikely to be effective when food sources are scarce or when deer numbers are high in relation to available food. Such situations can often occur in drought years, or when deer browse becomes scarce and grasses or other alternative forage is not present during California’s Mediterranean climate in late summer and autumn. Some home remedy repellents are used because in theory they produce odors thought to frighten or repel deer from an area. Examples are human hair, bars of soap with an intense fragrance, and predator feces or urine. These substances may repel deer for a day or a few days, perhaps more because of their novelty value rather than any inherent repellency. Most such odorous materials, as well as many commercially sold deer repellents, have not proven to be satisfactory in protecting gardens from deer damage in California.

    "contentQuickTips": "Although pleasant to look at in the wild, deer can be very destructive in gardens, orchards, and landscaped areas, feeding upon a wide variety of plants. To confirm deer caused the damage, look for tracks, droppings, and trails. Excluding deer with fences or plant protectors provides the best long-term control. Deer biology and behavior: Deer often feed late in the evening and very early in the morning, so you won’t always see them. They are a special problem in gardens next to woodlands that can provide cover during the day. The two most common deer in California are the mule deer and the blacktailed deer. Deer eat shrubs, vines, fruit and nut trees, garden vegetables, grasses, and small flowering plants. Look for these signs to confirm deer damage: Hoofprints, 2 to 3 inches long, split in the middle, pointed at the front, and more rounded at the rear. Piles of small jellybean-shaped droppings. Trampled plants and shredded or ragged foliage, buds, or terminals. Girdled trunks or branches broken by deer rubbing against them with their antlers. Be aware of legal restrictions. The California Fish and Game Code classifies deer as game animals. If deer are damaging your property or crops, you must get a permit to shoot them. Shooting, however, isn’t recommended around homes and gardens. For deer, traps and poisons are illegal and can’t be used. Protect your garden with fences. A properly built and maintained fence 7 or 8 feet high is the most effective control method. Fence height may need to be extended for steep slopes. Most existing fences can be made deer-proof by extending them 3 or 4 feet with mesh or smooth wire. Be sure the fence is sturdy and fitted to the ground, so deer can’t crawl under it. Use wire or plastic plant protectors to shield individual plants. Standard electric fences haven’t proven very effective. The New Zealand type may be effective but should be professionally installed and constantly monitored. Repellents and frightening devices: Chemical repellents that give off foul tastes or odors, such as the scent of a predator, can be useful in some situations. Repellents must be reapplied at frequent intervals, depending on what is used and the weather. Repellents may not work if preferred food sources for deer are available. Many repellents aren’t allowed on food crops or can damage some plants. Read the product label. Deer quickly adjust to most noisemaking devices such as propane cannons and electronic alarms, making them ineffective. However, new devices featuring deer distress sounds show promise. Consider deer-resistant plants. There are plant species deer prefer not to eat, especially when other more palatable plants are available. However, when food is scarce, deer will eat most plants, including many deer-resistant species. Consult your local nursery and garden center, UC Cooperative Extension office, or Master Gardeners, or refer to gardening publications about deer-resistant plants suitable for your area. ",

    "damagePestNote": "Coyotes come into conflict with humans in a variety of ways, from chasing and attacking pets in suburban areas, to chewing plastic drip irrigation systems in vineyards and orchards, killing livestock on rangelands, or killing other valued wild animals. The first step in solving any conflict with wildlife is to identify the wildlife species causing the problem. Because coyote damage often is not seen by humans as it is happening, heavy reliance must be placed on indirect evidence at the damage site. Inspect the area for “coyote sign” such as tracks, hair, droppings, or tooth marks on irrigation pipe. Tracks Coyote tracks can often be distinguished from those of dogs by their shape and appearance. Coyote tracks tend to be more oval-shaped and compact than those of common dog breeds. Nail marks of coyotes are less prominent, and the tracks tend to follow a straight line more closely than those of dogs. Tracks of large coyotes can be up to 3 by 1-3/4 inches. Hair Coyote hair may be found in fence wire, particularly at locations where coyotes have dug a “slide” to crawl under a chain-link or woven-wire fence. A close look at the hair will reveal bands of color on individual hairs (but many other animals also have hair with bands of color). Hairs from a coyote’s back are often black-tipped. Droppings Coyote droppings or “scats” are typically about the diameter of a cigar, sometimes tapering at one end. Scats are deposited along trails and roadsides and will vary in appearance depending on the animal’s diet and on the age of the scat. The scat may contain hair, feathers, bones or other animal parts, as well as plant materials such as grass or seeds. Scats are typically black to light gray in color, becoming bleached out as they remain exposed to sunlight and the elements. Tooth Marks Drip irrigation pipe and other such materials, when chewed by coyotes, have the appearance of having been compressed and shredded as if chewed by dogs. This is in contrast to chewing damage done by rodents or rabbits, where the pipe is scraped or gnawed repeatedly and often shows evidence of the presence of paired incisor tooth marks. Prey Remains When prey killed by coyotes is found and examined before it can be consumed or scavenged by other species, the appearance of the carcass may give clear evidence that coyotes were responsible. Coyotes usually kill small mammalian prey such as rabbits, young kid goats, and small lambs by biting them through the head or neck. The size and spacing of puncture wounds from the coyotes’ canine teeth is sometimes apparent; the spacing between a coyote’s canine teeth is typically 1 to 1-3/8 inches. A coyote’s carnassial (“cheek”) teeth are capable of making clean, knifelike cuts through carcasses, as coyotes sometimes dismember prey in order to transport portions to their den to feed pups. Municipal authorities and homeowners have sometimes found remains of dead house cats and mistakenly assumed they were mutilated by people practicing animal sacrifices, when in fact they were killed by coyotes. Larger prey such as large lambs, large kid goats, and adult sheep and goats are usually attacked at the throat and may show puncture wounds on the side of the head or on the lower part of the neck. Skinning the neck may reveal substantial hemorrhaging in the area of the attack that is not visible externally. In contrast, dogs usually kill such prey by attacking the hindquarters, flanks, and head, often mutilating prey and leaving a “messy” kill. Because inexperienced or young coyotes sometimes do not make typical or “clean” kills, and some dogs may kill in a manner resembling coyotes, it is important to seek additional evidence at the site before reaching a conclusion. Because coyotes will scavenge carcasses, it is important not to assume coyotes have killed every animal they might feed on. Livestock and other prey can die from a variety of causes. However, the presence of hemorrhaging and bruising on the skin around tooth punctures or bites indicates the animal was alive when it was attacked by a predator. During the twentieth century, livestock producers and government predator control agents often were able to control losses by suppressing coyote numbers, at least locally, through use of toxicants, traps, shooting, and other techniques. Population models reveal that to control coyote numbers through removal, more than three-quarters of all coyotes must be killed annually, and even then, their elimination would take decades of effort. As regulations on predator control tools and materials increased and society’s attitudes toward predators changed, it has become increasingly difficult to control coyote numbers or slow their range expansion into new areas. Today, toxicants are highly restricted for use in controlling coyotes, leghold traps are banned in some states including California, and shooting is not safe or legal in many situations, especially in suburban areas. Modern strategies to manage coyote damage integrate a number of nonlethal and preventive techniques, relying on lethal removal only when other techniques are ineffective or impractical. While coyote removal often results in a void that is quickly filled by coyotes moving in from surrounding areas, this does not mean that coyote removal is ineffective in reducing or stopping damage. Coyotes moving in to fill a void may have different travel patterns and preferences for prey, thus reducing conflicts with humans, pets, or livestock. Recent research, as well as decades of practical field experience, suggests that removal of dominant coyote pairs at the beginning of breeding season may substantially reduce predation on livestock for up to a year. Removal of coyotes from a population may result in more resources being available to remaining coyotes, thus increasing litter sizes and pup survival. However, coyote removal does not result in higher coyote populations over the long term, as numbers are largely regulated by food availability. Legal Status Coyotes have no special protection in California and may be killed by any method that is not prohibited by federal, state, or local statutes. Since the passage of a state ballot initiative measure in November 1998, leghold traps cannot be used to capture coyotes except in situations where a human health and safety emergency has been declared by designated officials, or in selected situations where the existence of an endangered species is threatened by predation. Toxicants or poisons used to control coyotes are illegal, with the exception of fumigant cartridges available only to predator control specialists to asphyxiate coyote pups in their dens. No chemical repellents are registered for use in repelling coyotes from property or from livestock. The situations in which coyotes cause damage are quite variable, and therefore strategies and solutions to resolve these problems also must be tailored to individual situations. Professional wildlife damage management specialists who are employed by federal, state, or county agencies can be very helpful in evaluating coyote damage and in assisting landowners to develop appropriate management strategies for specific situations. Contact your county agricultural commissioner or county Cooperative Extension office to obtain information about professionals who can control coyotes, or telephone the United States Department of Agriculture, California Wildlife Services state office at 916-979-2675, or see the Wildlife Services Web site. Exclusion Coyotes have the physical ability to go under, through, or over many types of fences. While coyotes generally prefer to dig under fences or go through fence gaps at gates or washouts, some coyotes have the inclination to jump or climb fences, particularly at corners or where cross-braces provide a foothold. While it is expensive and difficult to construct a completely coyote-proof fence, a fence that discourages coyotes will have the following design characteristics. Fence height should be a minimum of 5-1/2 feet and should be built higher on sloping terrain. Net wire-mesh should be no larger than 6 inches between stays. To deter digging under, bury a galvanized wire-mesh apron, attached securely to the bottom of the fence, 4 to 6 inches below the soil and extending outward at least 15 inches. An extra degree of protection against coyotes scaling a fence can be obtained by installing a wire-mesh overhang of at least 18 inches, slanted outward, or roller-type devices designed to be attached to the top of a fence, which prevent coyotes from getting a foothold in their attempts to climb or jump over. In general, truly coyote-proof fences are so expensive to build and maintain that they are economically viable only to protect very valuable commodities. Electric fences of various designs have been effective in excluding coyotes. Retrofitting existing fences by adding electrified wires may provide an added degree of effectiveness. Electric fencing can be less expensive to construct than conventional woven-wire fence, but it requires substantially more maintenance to keep it in working condition. Additionally, electrical fencing may be inappropriate for use or illegal in residential or suburban areas. Close off crawl spaces under mobile homes, porches, decks, and garden sheds, as coyotes can use these areas to rest and to rear their young. While quality fencing may not prevent all coyotes from entering an area, it will often result in coyotes leaving evidence of where and how they penetrated the fence, which will enable you to determine what other methods of management will be most effective to stop the damage. Hazing and Behavior Modification. Using sound or visual stimuli to keep coyotes away from livestock or other resources will provide only temporary effectiveness, if any. Such efforts are likely to work best in localities where coyotes are wary as a result of continuing predator control efforts and where the stimuli can be frequently varied in type and location. In the absence of any real threat, coyotes quickly adapt or habituate to sounds, flashing lights, propane cannons, scarecrows, and so on. A strobe-siren device, developed by researchers to keep coyotes away from sheep flocks at night, was effective only for several weeks to a few months at most locations where it was tested. Because of the disturbance such devices cause, they are impractical for use in suburban areas. When coyotes first venture into a suburban area, they likely have some degree of wariness toward humans. In this situation, certain hazing techniques may, when combined with modifications to make the environment less attractive, reduce the chance that coyotes will lose their wariness of humans. Suburban residents who see a coyote in their neighborhood should attempt to frighten it away by shouting, throwing rocks, squirting it with a water hose, blowing portable air horns, or otherwise acting aggressively in order to reinforce its fear of people. Motion-sensitive lights on houses or outbuildings may deter coyotes from approaching. Certain breeds of guard dogs, as well as llamas and donkeys, may effectively exclude coyotes from pastures. Livestock operators who have had the best success with guard animals typically place them in small, flat, fenced pastures where the guard animal can see and challenge any intruding coyotes. Guard animals are most effective when they are behaviorally bonded to the sheep or goats they are protecting. However, there are occasions when guard animals are of limited effectiveness, and multiple coyotes or mountain lions may even attack guard animals. In suburban areas, there have been instances of groups of coyotes attacking large dogs such as Labrador retrievers, even in the presence of their owners. Habitat Management in Suburban Areas Areas with lush landscaping provide ample food, water, and shelter for coyotes. Suburban coyotes can reach densities far greater than they do on rangeland or undeveloped wildlands. Homeowners can reduce the attractiveness of their property to coyotes by clearing or thinning thick vegetation and by removing brush and dense weeds from the landscape, thereby depriving coyotes and their prey of shelter and cover. In particular, prune back the lower limbs and branches of shrubs and small trees to a height of 2 feet, to deprive coyotes of cover where they can easily hide. Avoid using landscape plants that produce fruits and seeds, and pick fruit from trees before it falls to the ground to avoid attracting coyotes. Coyotes are attracted to ripening fruits of many kinds, and they will also readily consume the fruits of some plants commonly used for landscaping (Table 2). Install quality fencing around garden plots to exclude coyotes, as they will eat many common garden fruits and vegetables. Compost piles should be managed carefully so they will not encourage rodents or other prey attractive to coyotes, and they should be fenced or contained to exclude coyotes from foraging for grubs and worms. Eliminate available water sources for coyotes and other wildlife; for example, remove ponds or fountains, or install net wire fences around their perimeter. Manage bird feeders carefully to avoid spillage that attracts rodents and rabbits, which are attractive coyote prey.\tTable 2.

Confine livestock and poultry from dusk to dawn, and use lights above corrals. Control rodents, especially any that are living in and around your livestock facilities or residence. Be particularly attentive when lambs or kid goats are present, as well as during the coyotes’ pup rearing season (March through August), when their food needs are highest. Pet Management Cats and dogs should be fed indoors, or if fed outdoors, food dishes should be promptly emptied and removed after pets have eaten. Store pet food indoors or in sealed heavy-duty containers. Use refuse containers that have tight-fitting lids to prevent raccoons, dogs, or coyotes from having access to household garbage. Keep small pets such as cats, rabbits, and small dogs, indoors, or if outdoors, keep them within enclosed kennels. Large dogs should be brought inside after dark. Never allow cats or dogs to run free at any time, as they are easy prey. Because coyotes that come in contact with domestic animals may transmit diseases, vaccinate all pets for rabies, distemper, parvovirus, and other diseases, as recommended by a veterinarian. When exercising your dog, always use a leash, and walk only in populated areas of high pedestrian traffic. You may want to carry a walking stick or cane that you can use to fend off an attack. Try not to establish a regular routine in terms of route or time of day, as coyotes can learn your schedule and have been known to lie in wait to attack. Avoid walking pets at dawn or dusk, and avoid areas of dense vegetation or cover. Coyotes are more likely to attack dogs during the pup-rearing season, if dogs come too near the den site. If coyotes establish a den site near a residential area, attempts should be made to harass the coyotes so that they move their pups to an alternative, more remote den site. Never intentionally feed or provide water to coyotes, as this causes them to quickly lose their fear of people and become aggressive. Anyone who intentionally feeds coyotes is putting the entire neighborhood’s pets and children at risk of coyote attack and serious injury. In addition, ask your neighbors to also follow the described methods in order to reduce the potential for conflicts with coyotes. Responding to Coyote Aggression and Attack If you or your pets are approached by an aggressive or fearless coyote, try to frighten it away by shouting in a deep voice, waving your arms, throwing objects at the animal, and looking it directly in the eyes. Stand up if you are seated. If you are wearing a coat or vest, spread it open like a cape so that you appear larger. Retreat from the situation by walking slowly backward so that you do not turn your back on the coyote. If you are bitten or scratched by a coyote, wash the affected area thoroughly with soap and water and then seek immediate medical attention. Although most problem coyotes are healthy, the risk of rabies is always present. Rabies can occur from a bite or scrape from an infected coyote, or if you handle your pet after it has been attacked and the coyote’s saliva comes into contact with broken skin or mucous membranes. Because rabies infections in humans are nearly always fatal, medical authorities typically recommend post-exposure immunization whenever a person comes into contact with a wild coyote during an attack. Report any incidents of coyote aggression or attack to local authorities including your local animal control agency and the California Department of Fish & Game. Report any attacks on livestock to your county agricultural commissioner. Coyote Removal in Suburban Areas Once coyotes have lost their fear of humans or have started behaving aggressively, a health and safety hazard exists. Usually it can be remedied only by removal of one or more of the coyotes. Typically, coyote removal in urban or suburban areas is conducted by predator control professionals who shoot coyotes or capture them in padded leghold traps or snares. Captured coyotes must be destroyed, as relocating problem coyotes would incur unacceptable liability and risk on the part of the agency involved, and relocation is illegal without prior approval of the California Department of Fish & Game. Management experience has shown that removal of only a few problem coyotes from a population will reinstill fear of humans in the remaining population, often solving coyote problems in that locality for months or even years. Because other coyotes quickly move in to occupy vacant territories, removal of several animals has no long-term impact on coyote numbers. Following coyote removal, local agencies or authorities should evaluate the entire neighborhood and recommend preventive measures that homeowners should take in order to make the area less attractive to coyotes, thus preventing recurrence of the problem. Coyote Removal in Rural Areas In semi-rural settings or in agricultural lands, coyote damage to livestock, drip irrigation systems, and other resources often cannot be solved by habitat management or livestock management efforts alone. Professional assistance is usually required to remove the responsible coyotes as selectively and as efficiently as possible. Wildlife management specialists employed by United States Department of Agriculture Wildlife Services or by individual counties are available to assist landowners in most areas within California. Contact your county agricultural commissioner to obtain a referral, telephone the United States Department of Agriculture, California branch of Wildlife Services at 916-979-2675, or see their Web site . Wildlife Services professionals have experience in dealing with problem coyotes, which can be wary and difficult to capture. They can also use certain tools and methods that are not generally available to the public. There are also private “nuisance” wildlife control firms in some areas that specialize in dealing with suburban wildlife problems.",

While enjoyable to watch, cliff swallows nesting in colonies on buildings and other structures can become a nuisance. Their droppings can foul machinery, create aesthetic problems, and cause potential health hazards by contaminating foodstuffs. Their mud nests eventually fall to the ground and can cause similar problems. In addition, swallow nests frequently contain mites and insects such as swallow bugs (Oeciacus vicarius); swallow bugs are related to bed bugs and will bite humans, although humans are not their usual host. Seven members of the swallow family breed in California: the tree swallow (Tachycineta bicolor), violet-green swallow (Tachycineta thalassina), purple martin (Progne subis), bank swallow (Riparia riparia), rough-winged swallow (Stelgidopteryx serripennis), barn swallow (Hirundo rustica), and cliff swallow. The first three nest in cavities such as woodpecker holes or birdhouses. Bank and rough-winged swallows nest in natural crevices or burrows dug in earthen banks. Barn and cliff swallows build mud nests attached to buildings and other structures, a habit that sometimes puts them into conflict with people. This is particularly true of the cliff swallow—the swallow of San Juan Capistrano—which nests in large colonies of up to several hundred pairs. In contrast, barn swallows tend to nest as single pairs and, consequently, do not cause many problems. BIOLOGY Swallows feed on insects and spend a large part of each day in the air catching flies, beetles, and mosquitoes. Their long, pointed wings give them great speed and maneuverability. Normally, swallows are not seen on the ground except when collecting mud for their nests. Most do not have musical voices but only twitter or squeak. The cliff swallow is 5 to 6 inches in length and is the only square-tailed swallow in California. In contrast, the barn swallow is distinguished by its long, deeply forked tail. The cliff swallow is also recognized by its pale,orange-brown rump, white forehead, dark rust-colored throat, and steel blue crown and back. Distribution and Habitat Cliff swallows are found throughout California, except in high mountains and the dry southeastern desert. Four basic conditions are found at all cliff swallow colonies: (1) an open habitat for foraging; (2) a vertical surface beneath an overhang for attaching the nest; (3) a supply of mud that has the proper consistency for nest building; and (4) a body of fresh water for drinking. The original nesting sites of cliff swallows were cliffs and walls of canyons. Structures, such as buildings, bridges, and overpasses, and agricultural activities have increased the number and distribution of suitable nesting sites, and cliff swallow populations have increased accordingly. In general, wherever irrigation water and buildings or other structures are found, suitable breeding conditions may exist. Cliff swallows spend the winter months in South America. In late winter and early spring, they begin a northward migration through Central America and Mexico. Arrival dates can vary greatly because of weather conditions. The first migrants usually appear in southern California by late February or early March. Two or three weeks later cliff swallows begin arriving in northern California. Cliff swallows migrate during the day and catch flying insects en route. Swallows will not penetrate regions unless flying insects are available for food, which usually occurs after a few days of relatively warm weather (70°F or more). Site Selection Cliff swallows arrive at nest colonies in successive waves. A definite homing tendency exists among adults that previously nested at a colony. These birds are the first to return, followed by adults who bred at other colonies in previous years and by young birds who have not yet bred. The younger birds include individuals not born at the selected colony. In addition to their homing tendency, breeding swallows are attracted to old nests. Under suitable conditions, a nest is quite durable and can be used in successive years. Old nests are usually claimed on the first day of arrival, although probably not by the original makers. Dilapidated nests are quickly occupied and repaired. Nest Construction Cliff swallow nests are gourd-shaped enclosed structures built of mud pellets, consisting primarily of sand with smaller amounts of silt and clay. (In contrast, barn swallow nests are cup shaped and the pellets contain coarse organic matter such as grass stems, horsehairs, and feathers.) The cliff swallow nest chamber is globular and extends forward into an entrance tunnel that opens downward. The tunnel may be absent from some nests. Nest dimensions vary from 5-1/2 to 10-1/2 inches in length and 5-1/2 to 8 inches in basal width, and the opening averages 1-3/4 inches in diameter. The nest is cemented with mud under the eave of a building, bridge, or other vertical surface. Usually the first nests are located at the highest point possible with subsequent nests attached below it, forming a dense cluster. Both sexes construct the nest, proceeding slowly to allow the mud to dry and harden. Depending on mud supply and weather, nest construction takes 1 to 2 weeks. Mud is collected at ponds, puddles, ditches, and other sites up to one-half mile away, with many birds using the same mud source. A typical nest contains 1,000 to 1,400 mud pellets, each representing one trip to and from the nest. Cliff swallows sometimes build two or three nests per season; not all nests are used, however. Egg Laying Egg laying usually begins before the nest is completely finished. Each day one egg is laid until the clutch of three to four eggs is completed. In central California, egg laying generally occurs between late April and the end of May. In southern California nesting can begin during late March and in the extreme northeastern part of the state as late as June. Within a colony the date of egg laying varies because of the staggered arrival dates of the birds. Nest Failures Renesting will occur if nests or eggs are destroyed. For example, nests may fall because they were built too rapidly or they may crumble because of prolonged humid weather. House sparrows (Passer domesticus) sometimes take over empty swallow nests and have been known to drive off swallows from new nests. A cliff swallow nest taken over by house sparrows is identified by the abundant nest lining (grasses, weeds, and feathers) protruding from the entrance. Hatching and Feeding Both sexes incubate the eggs, which hatch in 15 or 16 days. The adults are kept busy feeding the nestlings by foraging over an area sometimes 2 to 4 miles from the nest. Occasionally, long periods of continuous rainfall make it difficult for the adults to find food and they may abandon the nestlings. A sign of a successful nest is white excrement rimming the nest entrance, indicating the presence inside of young swallows. Fledging and Post-nesting Period In mid-May to mid-June, 20 to 25 days after hatching, the young birds fledge (take their first flight). They look similar to adults but are dull colored and have less sharply defined color patterns. The young will return to the nest for 2 to 3 days to be fed before leaving it permanently. They remain near the colony for about a week. In California most cliff swallows raise one brood each year, although some may raise two. The time required from the start of nest building to departure after raising one brood is 47 to 64 days. Swallows are usually present at the colony for up to 100 days. After leaving the nesting colony, cliff swallows will remain in the general area for several weeks. By mid-August there is a general southward movement, and by the end of September few swallows remain, except in southern California where a few linger into October.",

    "managementPestNote": "Actions to solve problems with swallows should be started as soon as they are identified. Cliff swallows are colonial and the number of nesting birds can increase significantly from year to year. They are best managed by nest removal and exclusion techniques. There are no chemical toxicants registered for cliff swallow control, and shooting, trapping, or harming swallows is not permitted. Legal Status and Permit Requirements All swallows are included under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 as migratory insectivorous birds and as such are protected by state and federal regulations. It is illegal for any person to take, possess, transport, sell, or purchase them or their parts, such as feathers, nests, or eggs, without a permit. As a result, certain activities affecting swallows are subject to legal restrictions. The California Department of Fish and Game, the enforcement agency, considers February 15 to September 1 to be the swallow nesting season. Completed nests during this breeding season cannot be touched without a permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Outside of these dates, the nests can be removed without a permit. During nesting, a permit authorizing nest removal will be issued only if it can be justified by strong, compelling reasons. For example, such justification might include a health or safety hazard posed by a nesting colony situated over a doorway/entrance, near a loading area of a warehouse or a food processing facility, or at an airport if aircraft and maintenance safety are impaired. If eggs or young are in the nest when a permit is requested, the application will probably be denied. It is best to request the permit during the nonbreeding season and well before spring nest construction begins. Past history and problems will be taken into consideration. The permit is issued for one season only. The permit will authorize the permittee or the permittee's employee(s) to use specified methods to remove the nests. The number of nests removed must be reported within 10 days after the permit expires. For all permit requirements, contact the main office of USDA-APHIS Wildlife Services in your state. In California the address is 3419A Arden Way, Sacramento, CA 95825; phone (916) 979-2675. You will be referred to a district biologist who will assess the problem and make control recommendations. If lethal control is recommended, then a permit application must be completed and sent to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regional office along with a fee. Nest Removal In areas where a permit is required, the nest removal method will be specified by the permit. In California, old nests or nests under construction may be washed down with water or knocked down with a pole. Swallows are strongly attracted to old nests or to the remnants of deteriorated nests, so all traces of mud should be removed. During nest building, nest removal will require many days because cliff swallows persistently rebuild nests for most of the breeding season. They usually return the following year and the whole process must be repeated. Exclusion Exclusion refers to any control method that denies physical access to the nest site area. Exclusion represents a relatively permanent, long-term solution to the problem. In California, a permit is not required for this method if it is done before the birds arrive, during nest building when there are no eggs or young in the nest, or after the birds have left for the winter. If swallows have eggs or young in the nest, exclusion may not be used without a permit. Netting can provide a physical barrier between the birds and the nest site. The mesh size should be 1/2 to 3/4 inch; however, 1 inch has been used successfully. If a plastic net is used, it should be attached so that it can be pulled taut. This prevents flapping in the wind, which looks unsightly and results in tangles or breakage at mounting points. The net should not have any loose pockets or wrinkles that could trap and entangle birds. Attach netting to buildings before the birds arrive and leave it up permanently or remove it after the nesting season. Netting can be attached using tape, staples, or hooks on the eaves and the side of the building. An advantage of hooks is that the net can be taken down during the nonbreeding period or for maintenance of light fixtures, painting, etc. If staples are used, they should be rust-resistant to avoid unsightly rust stains on the building. For netting, a supporting framework of wooden dowels, wood laths, or metal rods along the edges will ease attachment to the hooks and create more even tension on the net. Netting may also be wrapped once or twice around wood laths and nailed directly to the building. It should extend from the outer edge of eaves down to the side of the building where protection from the elements given by the eaves is lost. Be sure there are no openings in the net where swallows might enter. Some individuals have reported that hanging a curtain of netting from the eave will prevent nesting. The curtain should be 3 to 4 inches from the wall and extend down from the eave 18 inches or more. Blocking the entrance will prevent cliff swallows from nesting inside buildings. Hang netting or strip doors of vinyl plastic or similar material across the entrance like a curtain, allowing passage of vehicles, materials, or people. Weighting the bottom of the netting will help keep it reasonably taut and in position during windy weather. Cliff swallows have been known to abandon nests inside a barn loft when the entrance was partially closed, reducing it to less than 8 x 8 feet. Usually, swallows will not fly into a net but will stop and hover in front of it. If only that section of a building where swallows have nested is netted, the swallows will often choose alternative sites on the same structure. Therefore, any part of a building suitable for nesting must be netted. After the netting or wire mesh is installed, monitor the area for entry points and make necessary adjustments. Other Methods Nesting is sometimes discouraged through the use of metal projectors.These are sharp, needlelike wire or plastic devices generally installed along building ledges and windowsills to discourage birds from roosting. This method is not always successful in preventing swallows from nesting. In one instance cliff swallows learned to land on the metal spines and eventually built nests attached to them. Attach the sharp projectors to cover the area where swallows prefer to build nests, especially horizontally along walls protected by eaves. Additional projectors running vertically should be attached along interior corners. Once installed, projectors are left in place permanently. Fiberglass panels that are 6 inches wide have been used to prevent nesting in some situations. The panels are installed between the eave and wall forming a smooth, concave surface that makes nest attachment difficult. Modification of the surface where swallow nests would be attached sometimes effectively discourages nesting. Swallows prefer rough, uneven surfaces that provide a good foothold and suitable surface for nest attachment. Removing the rough surface of the wall and overhang can make the site less attractive to swallows. Attaching glass, sheet metal, or other very smooth-surfaced materials to the potential nest site can inhibit swallow nesting. A fresh coat of paint producing a slick surface may discourage nesting. Removing old nests and painting the area may discourage nesting the following year. Other methods have shown little success or are unproven against cliff swallows. These include employing hawk, owl, or snake models or using taped alarm calls, noisemakers, revolving lights, and chemical roost repellents.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Several bird species can cause substantial damage by feeding on ripening fruit and nuts. Often, early ripening fruit species, such as cherries, are the most extensively damaged; almonds also can receive significant damage. Bird damage usually is most severe at sites that are adjacent to wild or brushy areas where birds find refuge, breeding sites, and other sources of food. Orchards surrounded by other orchards often have fewer problems with birds. The amount of damage, type of damage, and effective control methods vary among species of birds, so it is important that you identify which species is causing the damage. Generally, the following bird species are the most common depredators of fruiting trees and vines: crowned sparrow (Zonotrichia species), house finch (Carpodacus mexicanus), robin (Turdus migratorius), scrub jay (Aphelocoma coerulescens), crows (Corvus brachyrhynchos), European starling (Sturnus vulgaris), and yellow-billed magpie (Pica nuttalli). Crowned Sparrows There are two species of crowned sparrows that occur in California. Both species exhibit the typical sparrow coloring of brown shades on the back and a grayish breast and are around 7 inches long. However, adult white-crowned sparrows (Figure 1) have three white and four black stripes on the head, while golden-crowned sparrows have a dull gold crown with a black border. Both species occur in small or large flocks and feed on dormant flower buds and ripening fruit (Figure 2). Crowned sparrows are classified as migratory, nongame birds and can be removed only with a depredation permit from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service or while under the supervision of the local county Agricultural Commissioner. House Finch The house finch is typically 5 to 6 inches long. Males have a rosy-red or orange head, rump, and breast with a brownish back and wings and a brown streak on their sides (Figure 3). Females lack the red or orange coloration. Finches occur in small to large flocks and feed on dormant flower buds and ripening fruit (Figure 4). House finches are classified as migratory, nongame birds and can be removed only with a depredation permit from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or while under the supervision of the local county Agricultural Commissioner. American Robin The American robin has an orange-red breast, grey-brown upper parts, a white throat, a black to dark brown head and tail, and typically is 10 inches long. It is a very common and well-known bird. Robins are classified as migratory, nongame birds and can be removed only with a depredation permit from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or while under the supervision of the local county Agricultural Commissioner. Scrub Jay Scrub jays are aggressive birds, 10 to 12 inches long, and are distinguished by their crestless head, olive-gray back, and white throat that is outlined in blue; their head, tail, and wings are blue (Figure 5). Scrub jays usually are solitary birds but occasionally are seen in groups. This species can feed on opening flowers of early blooming stone fruits such as cherries, especially in backyard settings. Scrub jays are classified as migratory, nongame birds and can be removed only with a depredation permit from the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or while under the supervision of the local county Agricultural Commissioner. Crow The crow is a large, chunky, black-colored bird, 17 to 21 inches long with a thick, black bill and feet. Crows are seen in groups of a few birds or in large flocks. They will feed on ripening fruit and nuts. Crows are classified as migratory, nongame birds. However, given their abundance and damaging nature, they can be removed by landowners, tenants, or persons authorized by landowners or tenants when damaging crops. European Starling European starlings are 8 to 9 inches long with a short tail. Their bill is yellow in spring and summer but dark in winter, while their plumage is iridescent black or purplish and is heavily speckled with white. Large flocks often are seen feeding on ripening fruit. Starlings are classified as nongame birds that can be removed at any time. There are no federal restrictions for taking starlings. Yellow-billed Magpie The yellow-billed magpie is a large, noisy bird, 16 to 20 inches long. It has distinct black and white markings on its body and a very long tail . It often is seen in small groups feeding on ripening fruit. The magpie is classified as a migratory, nongame bird; no permit is required to take magpies causing or about to cause damage to fruiting trees or vines. That being said, regulations often change, so it is a good idea to contact the local county Agricultural Commissioner’s office before removing magpies to ensure no laws are violated. Regular, weekly monitoring through bird counts will help you determine when populations increase, so you can take action early. Watch for movement of birds into or within an area. This is particularly important for reducing damage to fruit buds, as this damage is difficult to detect until trees are blooming. Keep track of species by count and location seasonally if you have had substantial damage in the past. These records will help you plan control strategies in advance and will provide information on the effectiveness of previous control actions. As fruits begin to ripen, look for fruit that is damaged or has been knocked from the tree; this is another good technique for monitoring bird damage.",

These records will help you plan control strategies in advance and will provide information on the effectiveness of previous control actions. As fruits begin to ripen, look for fruit that is damaged or has been knocked from the tree; this is another good technique for monitoring bird damage. Protective Netting The most effective way to reduce bird damage to small orchards and isolated trees is netting. You can prevent access of birds to ripening fruit by placing 1/4- to 1/2-inch mesh plastic netting over the plant. It is best to attach the netting to a frame that holds it away from the tree to avoid birds accessing the fruit at the outer edges of the canopy. The use of netting does have its disadvantages. It has high initial costs, is time consuming to apply, and is inconvenient to work around. However, it still is a desirable method in many situations given its high efficacy and the fact that the netting can be reused many times. Frightening Devices The most effective way to frighten birds from an area is to use a combination of noisemakers and visual repellents. For maximum effectiveness, rotate from one type of frightening device to another, and do not use one combination of devices for more than a week; otherwise, birds will become used to it. Common noisemakers include bird bombs and shell crackers that are shot off by a person who is patrolling the orchards or fields. Stationary devices such as gas cannons and electronic distress calls also provide relief from some species of birds. These stationary devices are most effective when you have at least one device for every 5 acres, when they are elevated above the tree canopy, and when they are relocated frequently. Crows, scrub jays, and magpies are quick to learn to ignore noisemakers, in some cases overcoming the repellency effect in a matter of hours. Sometimes the effectiveness of noisemakers increases when used in combination with visual repellents such as Mylar streamers or ”scare-eye“ balloons. For example, scare-eye balloons can be attached to trees that are next to electronic distress-call devices. This combination might increase effectiveness over using either approach by itself. Regardless of the approach used, much attention must be paid to the birds’ responses when using frightening devices. When birds no longer respond negatively to a specific approach, you must switch to a different frightening tactic to continue to scare birds out of the desired trees. At best, an appropriate rotation of frightening devices will control bird pests for a few days to perhaps a few weeks. Therefore, use these scare tactics only when needed to prevent birds from habituating to these auditory and visual repellents. The availability of alternative food sources likely influences the efficacy of frightening devices. Because birds that damage tree fruit and vines are not active at night, it is important to be sure your auditory devices are operated only during the daylight hours. Because auditory devices are loud, they often are not appropriate in urban or residential areas. In such situations, netting or chemical repellents would be more appropriate. Shooting Birds that usually invade rural orchards in small numbers, such as scrub jays and magpies, often can be controlled by shooting. A depredation permit is required if you want to shoot scrub jays. Permits presently are not required for shooting crows, magpies, or starlings that are causing damage, but it is a good idea to check with authorities, because regulations can change. Where permissible, occasionally shooting at a few birds will increase effectiveness of your noisemaking techniques, because birds will begin associating loud noises with the real hazards of firearms. However, shooting is not permissible in most urban or residential areas. Trapping Birds are highly mobile, and new birds move into an area quickly when populations are reduced, making trapping an ineffective method for controlling most bird problems in small orchards and backyards. Also, in the time it takes to trap enough birds to reduce damage to acceptable levels, the production season often is over. One exception occurs with resident sparrows, house finches, or starlings that live in the same area year-round. In such situations, a modified Australian crow trap can be used to effectively remove these resident birds, although trapping should be initiated well before the damage begins in order to reduce the local population. Because of their homing ability, releasing trapped birds elsewhere is not a viable solution. As such, birds must be humanely euthanized—a CO2 chamber currently is the preferred method—after capture. Only starlings can be trapped and destroyed without a permit. Repellents Chemical repellents rely on objectionable tastes, odors, or learned aversions to deter birds from consuming or damaging fruit. Commercial repellents containing the active ingredient methyl anthranilate currently are registered for use on such edible fruits as cherries, apples, blueberries, and grapes. These repellents have been shown to effectively reduce fruit damage by birds in some studies, while showing little efficacy in others. As with other types of repellents, the efficacy of chemical repellents likely is influenced by the availability of alternative food sources and by the ability of the user to apply the repellent following the label recommendations. These repellents might provide some relief for small orchards and backyard trees and vines although their overall efficacy is uncertain.",

Of the 25 species found in California, almost all are insectivores that feed on vast numbers of night-flying insects, making them an important part of the ecological community.

    "managementPestNote": "Bats that you find on the ground or out in the open during the day aren’t always sick. If they are in an area where they aren’t harming anyone and pets and children aren’t likely to find them, leave them alone for an hour or two. Sometimes they’re tired from long migration flights. If they are in an area where children or animals might find them, gently scoop the bat into an open box, wearing leather gloves to prevent touching the bat with your bare hands, and move it to a place where no one can come into contact with it. If the bat has been in contact with pets or people, take it to the county health department, so trained professionals can check it for rabies. Once a bat has died, it is too late to check for rabies, because the rabies virus dies shortly after the host does. Sometimes a colony of bats will show up at a house in the spring or fall. Often this is a migratory colony, and it will move on after a few weeks of rest. If the bats are in an area that can be tolerated, such as an outside eave, then wait a few weeks, and once the bats have left, seal the area, so they can’t return. Bats roosting in barns or other outdoor buildings might not cause any harm. Some people encourage bats by placing bat houses on their property. However, because of the threat of rabies and other diseases, bats should be discouraged from nesting at locations where people congregate, such as schools, parks, public buildings, or homes. Bats flying inside inhabited buildings should be removed or excluded. If you suspect bats are roosting in your building, you’ll need to carefully look for signs of them. Bats can squeeze through openings as small as 1/4 inch. Cracks around windows, doors, pipes, electrical wiring, or vents can provide access. Being alert to off odors or to droppings beneath openings can help you locate roosts and entry points. Return late in the evening, just before dark, to observe how bats are gaining entry into a building by watching where they fly out. Exclusion is the primary way to manage bats, but you’ll want to be sure all bats have left the structure before you seal it up completely. Most bats you discover indoors will be flying, but some might be roosting or asleep. During cool weather, bats can become torpid; this reduced activity is due to a lowering of their body temperature. Torpid bats might appear to be sick or dead or might bare their teeth or hiss, a defensive behavior to ward off potential predators. It often takes up to an hour or more for a torpid bat to warm enough to take flight. You can gently scrape a torpid bat into a can or box, cover the can, allow the bat to warm up in safety, then release it outside. Never handle bats unless you are wearing leather gloves, since a frightened animal is likely to bite in self-defense. Removal from Dwellings A bat that flies into human living spaces usually is a young, lost one, and its only goal is to escape. A sudden, panicked exit by humans probably is the worst possible action, as it can cause the bat to hide, making it not only difficult to find but almost impossible to notice if it manages to find a way out on its own. The best action is to keep the flying bat in sight while closing doors to other parts of the house and isolating the mammal to a single room, where no pets or family members are present. If possible, open doors and windows to the outside, so the bat can find its own way of escape. As a further attempt, wait until the bat lands, and approach it slowly. Place a small box or coffee can over the bat, and gently slide a piece of cardboard beneath the container, trapping the bat inside. Then you can release the bat outdoors. Wear leather gloves to avoid being bitten. As a last resort you might be able to catch a bat in flight using a fishing or butterfly net swung from behind the mammal. However, it sometimes is difficult to release bats from netted material. If this occurs, turn the net inside out, and let the bat try to work itself free. Avoid handling any bat unless you are wearing leather gloves. Excluding Single Bats Bats can enter through open doors or windows. Other common entry points include chimneys that don’t have grates and doors with loose-fitting screens. Placing 1/2-inch or smaller welded wire mesh over chimney tops (Check with your fire department for local regulations on spark arresters.) and installing tighter-fitting screen doors can solve these situations. Conduct a room-by-room search for other points of entry, and seal holes that are more than 1/2 inch in diameter or cracks that are 1/4 by 1–1/2 inches or larger. You can close openings around plumbing pipes by using steel wool or other suitable material. Bats don’t chew holes or gnaw electrical wires. Excluding Bat Colonies Large numbers of bats living in attics or walls are undesirable. Most bat colonies are small and go unnoticed for years, but when odor or noise increases or bat droppings accumulate, eviction and exclusion are the only safe and permanent remedies. Entry points of large colonies usually are quite obvious. When bats start emerging at dusk to feed, watch the building to see where they exit. Daytime inspection should reveal the holes or cracks they are using. Often, these will be beneath eaves, around the chimney, around air and plumbing vents, near loose boards, beneath roof caps, or in openings that squirrels or other animals have made. You also can identify the location by looking for staining caused by body oils (similar to rodent “rub marks”), bat urine, and bat droppings. Bat droppings, known as guano, crush easily, revealing shiny bits of undigested insects. Mouse droppings lack the shiny bits, and bat droppings never are white or chalky as are bird droppings. Seal entryways with caulking, putty, duct tape, self-expanding polyurethane foam, or hardware cloth (1/4-inch mesh) after you have excluded the bats. You’ll want to avoid excluding bat colonies when flightless young could be present, usually May through September in California. Excluding the parents will starve the young and create odor problems and an infestation of flies. Most bats leave in late fall in most areas, making winter an ideal time to implement exclusion techniques. If exclusion needs to be done before bats have moved out of a structure, you’ll need to provide a way for them to leave at night that doesn’t allow them to re-enter. A relatively simple technique involves hanging 1/2-inch polypropylene bird netting, or another type of fabric that allows light to show through, above the exit using duct tape or staples, so bats can still see their exit hole. One netting vendor is Wildlife Control Technology (www.wildlife-control.com), and bird netting is available at many hardware and garden stores. Attach the netting 12 inches above the exit holes, and extend it 12 inches past the sides and bottom. The bottom must hang freely, creating a one-way flap that allows the bats to drop down to leave. Another method is to insert a 2-inch diameter plastic pipe with a tube of collapsible material, such as plastic tarp, attached to its end. When the bats return, they can’t fly back in. Be sure to seal up all other potential entryways. Leave the netting or exit tube in place for 7 days to ensure no bats are trapped inside. Then you can make more permanent repairs. You can exclude bats from Spanish tile roofs using bird netting, but the simplest solution often is to install rain gutters. You also can fill the open ends of the tiles with concrete or tightly fitted bird-stop strips. Mylar strips 2 inches wide by 10 inches long also can deter bats. Chemical Repellents No pesticides or chemical repellents are registered in California for controlling bats or repelling them from roosting areas. Mechanical Repellents Some mechanical repellents can help discourage bats. Illuminating attic spaces and eaves with electric lights 24 hours a day might be helpful. Cooling an attic with fans can make the temperature unsuitable for roosting, and the increased air movement also can create a less favorable roosting area. All ultrasonic sound generators that have been tested have proven to be ineffective for repelling bats. BAT HOUSES Some people are interested in encouraging bat populations by installing artificial roosting sites or bat boxes. Bat houses aren’t likely to discourage bats from roosting in nearby buildings, and there is no clear evidence that their installation will significantly reduce garden insect problems. If you chose to put up a bat house, make sure it is in an area that has minimal disturbance from people and animals. Sometimes sick bats fall out of the roost where children and household pets easily can pick them up. Bat houses and bat-house designs are widely available commercially. Follow the guidelines below when constructing and installing a bat house:\tUse rough-sided wood on the interior of the house. Horizontally groove the interior surface for toe holds.\tRoosting chambers should be 1/2 to 1 inch wide; chambers larger than 1 inch invite wasps.\tCaulk outside seams to limit airflow.\tUse roofing felt (tar paper) or dark roof shingles on top and 6 inches down the sides to increase inside temperatures; a 90°F inside temperature is ideal.\tInstall bat houses at least 10 feet above ground with an eastern or northern exposure. Bats prefer houses that get morning sun and afternoon shade.\tProtect the house from prevailing winds, if possible, and provide an unobstructed approach for flying bats.\tBat houses attached to the sides of buildings tend to have the greatest success, but be careful, since bat droppings will accumulate below. Bat houses on poles in open areas sometimes work, but bats rarely occupy houses placed in trees. Installing bat houses before March improves the chance of occupancy. It is not unusual for bat houses to remain unoccupied for a year or more. Bats prefer houses that are within 1/4 mile of water with enough room to drink on the wing. More information on bat boxes is available in the UC ANR publication Songbird, Bat and Owl Boxes.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Control of yellow starthistle cannot be accomplished with a single treatment or in a single year. Effective management requires control of the current population and suppression of seed production, combined with establishment of competitive, desirable vegetation. Prevention Yellow starthistle proliferates along roadsides. Invasion by this weed may be increased with disturbances created by road building and maintenance. Seeds are often spread by vehicles or with the transportation of livestock or contaminated soil. Survey roadsides for the presence of this weed and immediately control new infestations to prevent seed production and its subsequent spread. Yellow starthistle also can be spread as a contaminant in grass seed. Only certified seed should be used for range or pasture seeding. Seed may also come as a contaminant in all classes of hay, particularly grass hay. Carefully check hay shipments for evidence of yellow starthistle. Hay used as mulch along roadsides or disturbed areas can be a source of yellow starthistle introduction. When feeding hay is suspected of containing yellow starthistle, place bales in one area and periodically check around feeding areas for signs of starthistle seedlings. Livestock that have fed in yellow starthistle-infested areas should not be pastured or shipped to uninfested areas. Control newly emerged seedlings to prevent establishment. It is important to control new infestations when they are small because spot eradication is least expensive and most effective at this time. Biological Control Four natural enemies of yellow starthistle have been imported from Europe and by 2003 were well established in California. These biological control agents include two weevils (Bangasternus orientalis and Eustenopus villosus) and two flies (Urophora sirunaseva and Chaetorellia succinea). They all attack the flower/seed head and directly or indirectly reduce seed production, the only means of reproduction and spread of the weed. The insects lay their eggs in, on, or near flower/seed heads and complete their development within them. Eustenopus villosus adults also directly reduce seed production by feeding on immature flower heads. All of these insects are highly host-specific to yellow starthistle and do not attack commercially valuable crops or native plants. These insects already occur in most areas of California that are infested with yellow starthistle. If additional releases of these natural enemies are made, protect the release area from practices that may damage the insects. Such practices include insecticide applications, soil cultivation, summer-prescribed burning, or mowing when the plants are in the flowering stage. After establishment, the insects are capable of building up to high numbers and spreading on their own. These insects do best in areas with warm, dry summer climates. The most recent releases, Eustenopus villosus and Chaetorellia succinea, have proven to be the most effective agents for yellow starthistle seed suppression. These insects are becoming more widespread throughout the state. However, they only suppress yellow starthistle seed production by about 50%, so they should not be considered as the sole method of control. It is possible that a combination of herbicides and biologicial control will provide more sustainable control than either technique used alone. Landowners and managers with yellow starthistle problems may contact their county agricultural commissioner’s office about obtaining these biological control insects. Most recently a rust, Puccinea jaceae var. solstitialis, was approved for release in California. Trials are under way to determine the potential effectiveness of this organism on yellow starthistle. Cultural Control Yellow starthistle begins emergence with fall rains and continues to germinate throughout the rainy season. A single cultivation after the rainy season when soils are dry effectively controls yellow starthistle seedlings and rosettes. This treatment must be made after the last rains but before seeds are produced. If cultivation is carried out too early (e.g., before the last rains) seed will continue to germinate and another cultivation will be needed to control each new flush of seedlings that results from a spring rain. Mowing can be used to manage yellow starthistle, provided it is well timed and used on plants with a high branching pattern. Mowing early growth stages results in increased light penetration and rapid regrowth of the weed. If plants branch from near the base, regrowth will occur from recovering branches. Repeated mowing of plants too early in their life cycles (rosette or bolting stages) or when branches are below the mowing height will not prevent seed production, as flowers will develop below the mower cutting height. Plants with a high branching pattern are easier to control, as recovery will be greatly reduced. Even plants with this growth pattern must be mowed in the late spiny or early flowering stage to be successful. An additional mowing may be necessary in some cases. To encourage growth of desirable vegetation, let these species set seed before mowing, but be sure to mow well before starthistle is in full flower. In general, mowing is most effective when soil moisture is low and no irrigation or rainfall follows mowing. Grazing is effective in reducing yellow starthistle seed production. Sheep, goats, or cattle eat yellow starthistle before spines form on the plant. Goats will eat starthistle even in the spiny stage. The plant’s crude protein concentration is variable, but ranges from 28% at the rosette stage down to 11% at the bud stage and should be sufficient to meet the general maintenance requirements for most ruminants. When it is abundant, yellow starthistle appears to have the ability to sustain animals several weeks beyond annual grass “dry down.” Intensive grazing in late May and June using large numbers of animals for short duration can reduce plant height, canopy size, and seed production. Avoid overgrazing, however; do not allow more than half the grass forage to be removed. Grazing more than this will reduce the grasses’ recovery rate and ability to shade out yellow starthistle. Burning is best performed at the end of the rainy season when flowers first appear. Yellow starthistle should be green at this time and will require desiccated vegetation to burn. Most annual vegetation other than yellow starthistle, particularly grasses, should have dried and shed their seeds by this time. The foliage of these plants serves as a fuel source to allow a more complete burn. Burning for 2 or more consecutive years helps suppress yellow starthistle and deplete the soil seedbank. Burning can also increase the recovery and density of perennial grasses. Burning can damage biological control agents, but insects from adjacent areas will readily move back into the site the following year. Revegetation Control practices are capable of reducing yellow starthistle populations, but in the absence of competition, starthistle will often reestablish. Effective management requires that desirable plant species be encouraged or planted and managed to prevent yellow starthistle germination or growth. Species choice for revegetation will depend on the intended use of that site. Resident vegetation such as perennial bunchgrasses or wildflowers may be desirable along roadsides, abandoned pastures, or in rangelands and wildlands. In these situations, cultural, biological, or chemical methods can be used to reduce yellow starthistle while encouraging other plant species, if possible, with practices such as fertilization. Research efforts to reestablish native perennial grasses are in progress. Perennial grasses are slow to establish and may require herbicide treatments to assist yellow starthistle or annual grass control during establishment, but once well established, alternative controls such as properly timed grazing, mowing, or burning can be used effectively. In pastures, eliminate dense stands of yellow starthistle and reseed the area with a fast-growing, competitive forage species. Although annual legumes work well for this purpose, the lack of selective herbicides makes follow-up treatments difficult. Therefore, grasses are best because selective herbicides can then be used to control yellow starthistle plants not eliminated by grass competition. In areas with scattered yellow starthistle infestations, eliminate scattered plants and overseed with a desirable species to provide enough competition to prevent yellow starthistle from reestablishing. In all instances, choose desirable species that are well adapted to the site and not likely to become invasive themselves. Species that grow well are the best competitors. Chemical Control Both postemergent and preemergent herbicides are available to control yellow starthistle along roadsides, rights-of-way, and noncrop areas. Most herbicides registered for use in rangeland and pastures are only active postemergence. Clopyralid, however, has both preemergence and postemergence activity on yellow starthistle. Postemergent Herbicides Postemergent herbicide treatments generally work best on seedlings. The long germination period of yellow starthistle makes control with a single application almost impossible. A treatment following the first flush of seedlings opens a site up for later flushes. Waiting until later in the rainy season to apply a postemergent herbicide allows a greater number of seedlings to be treated, but larger plants will require higher herbicide rates and may not be controlled. Aminopyralid and clopyralid are growth regulator herbicides for use in noncrop areas, including rangeland and pastures. Unlike other growth regulator herbicides, these are effective on yellow starthistle both postemergence and preemergence. The most effective timing for aminopyralid application is from December to March, when yellow starthistle is in the seedling to midrosette stage; its soil residual should last until the end of the rainy season. Clopyralid has a shorter soil residual and should be applied January to March. For both chemicals, earlier applications (i.e., in fall) may not provide full-season control, and later applications (bolting to early spiny stage) will require higher rates. A single application at the recommended time will provide season-long control. Aminopyralid is used at 0.75 to 1.75 oz acid equivalent/acre, and clopyralid is used at 2 to 3.96 oz acid equivalent/acre. Both chemicals are selective on many members of the sunflower family, particularly thistles, but can also injure legumes, including clovers. Most other broadleaf species and all grasses are not injured. There are no grazing restrictions after aminopyralid or clopyralid use in rangelands. While not registered for use around the home, aminopyralid and clopyralid do have registration for use in pastures, rangelands, rights-of-way, roadsides, and other noncrop areas. Clippings from treated areas should not be used as compost; these herbicides degrade slowly in compost and can be a problem when used as a mulch or fertilizer source in sensitive crops or landscapes. 2,4-D can provide acceptable control of yellow starthistle if it is applied at the proper rate and time. Treatment in the rosette growth stage provides better control than later applications. Amine formulations are as effective as ester formulations at the small rosette growth stage, and amine formulations reduce the chance of off-target movement. Application rates of 0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient/acre will control small rosettes. Applications made later in the season, when rosettes are larger or after bolting has been initiated, require a higher application rate (1 to 2 lb active ingredient/acre) to achieve equivalent control. 2,4-D is a growth regulator and a selective herbicide that controls many other broadleaf plants, but has minimal effect on clovers and generally does not harm grasses. It has little, if any, soil activity. Drift from 2,4-D applications is common, particularly from ester formulations. Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation or during windy or high temperature conditions. Certain formulations of 2,4-D require a restricted materials permit; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities (i.e., liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound) do not require a permit. Dicamba is very effective at controlling yellow starthistle at rates as low as 0.25 lb active ingredient/acre. When yellow starthistle rosettes are small, about 1 to 1.5 inches across, the 0.25 lb active ingredient/acre rate works well, but higher rates (0.5 to 0.75 lb active ingredient/acre) are needed if plants are larger. Applications made in late rosette to early bolting stages have provided excellent control, although earlier treatments are better. Dicamba is also a growth regulator and selective herbicide that controls many broadleaf plants, including clovers, but does not harm grasses. Its soil activity is very short. Like 2,4-D, it is available as both an amine and as an ester formulation. Drift from dicamba applications is common, especially from the ester formulation. Some formulations have lower drift potential than others. Use caution when applying near sensitive vegetation. Certain formulations of dicamba require a restricted materials permit; generally formulations that are sold in small quantities (i.e., liquid formulations that do not exceed 1 quart and dry formulations that do not exceed 1 pound) do not require a permit. Triclopyr at 0.5 lb active ingredient/acre provides complete control of yellow starthistle seedlings but is not as effective on larger plants. More mature plants require rates up to 1.5 lb active ingredient/acre. Like 2,4-D and dicamba, triclopyr is a growth regulator herbicide with little or no residual activity. It is foliar-absorbed and active on broadleaf species, including clovers, but typically does not harm grasses. Triclopyr is formulated as both an amine and ester. The ester formulation is more sensitive to drift than the amine form. Caution should be observed when using the ester formulation. This material is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures, rangelands, rights-of-way, roadsides, and other noncrop areas. Glyphosate controls yellow starthistle at 1 lb active ingredient/acre. Good coverage, clean water, and actively growing yellow starthistle plants are all essential for adequate control. Unlike growth regulator herbicides, glyphosate is nonselective and controls most plants, including grasses. It has no soil activity. A 1% solution of glyphosate also provides effective control and is used at this concentration for spot treatment of small patches. An application of glyphosate is a very effective method of controlling starthistle plants in the bolting, spiny, and early flowering stages at 1 to 2 lb active ingredient/acre. However, glyphosate will severely damage desirable perennial grasses if they are sprayed as well. Glyphosate is registered for use around the home as well as for pastures, rangelands, rights-of-way, roadsides, and other noncrop areas. Preemergent Herbicides Preemergent herbicides must be applied before seeds germinate to be effective. The long germination period of yellow starthistle requires that a preemergent material have a lengthy residual activity. Make applications before a rain, which will move the material into the soil. Because these materials adhere to soil particles, off-site movement and possible injury of susceptible plants could occur if the soil is dry and wind occurs before rain. When yellow starthistle plants have already emerged, it is possible to combine a postemergent herbicide (to control emerged plants) with a preemergent herbicide (to provide residual control of any subsequent germination) for an effective control strategy. Chlorsulfuron and sulfometuron are preemergent herbicides registered for roadsides and other noncrop uses. Chlorsulfuron was recently registered for use in rangelands. Both are very effective at controlling yellow starthistle when applied at 1 to 2 oz active ingredient/acre. Little postemergence activity occurs on yellow starthistle with these two compounds. Best control is achieved when applications are made before weeds emerge. They may not be used around the home. Integrated Approaches Combinations of prescribed burning and clopyralid can be very effective for yellow starthistle control. However, when using this integrated approach it is important that a prescribed burn be conducted the first year (or possibly for 2 years) and that clopyralid be applied in the last year of the program. Treating in the first year and burning in the second year may increase the starthistle problem because burning has been shown to increase seed germination during the following rainy season. Continued control of yellow starthistle after the last year of treatment can be accomplished by either mowing, spot spraying, or hand-pulling.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "For urban residents, the control of weedy or invasive woody species and large perennial grasses, such as bamboo, can be difficult (see Table 1). Although many of these troublesome species are not closely related, they share one very important characteristic: following mechanical removal of shoot material, resprouting can occur rapidly from root crowns, rhizomes, or basal and low-growing stems. In many cases, the resprouting shoots will outnumber the original plants. This increases the difficulty of control. Some of the species listed below, including poison oak, willow, chamise, cottonwoods (poplars), and certain wild blackberries, are natives and are not considered weedy in natural systems. However, in certain landscapes—for example, in urban settings—these species may become too dense and create a fire hazard or restrict movement of animals or humans through these areas. Poison oak can also be an important health issue.\tTable 1.

However, under some conditions, mechanical methods can control smaller shrubs or bunching perennial grasses, such as pampasgrass. For example, hand-pulling, digging, or hoeing can be used to remove small shrubs or roots located in a yard or near houses. Small shrubs or saplings can also be pulled using a weed wrench tool. These procedures should be done in early spring or late fall when the soil is moist and the roots are easily removed. Digging when the soil is dry and hard usually breaks off the stems, leaving the stem crowns, rhizomes, or roots to resprout. In urban settings, irrigation may be an option to loosen soil prior to digging. Removing English or Algerian ivy with a shovel can be very effective if roots and stems are dug out. It is essential to remove all runners. Cutting or mowing English or Algerian ivy followed by an application of glyphosate to the damaged leaves and cut stem tips can also provide effective control. For the ivy species, it is important that gloves be worn, as many people are sensitive to the dermatitis-causing agents in the plant. Physical removal of poison oak is not typically recommended, as the majority of the population is sensitive to the urushiol oils in the plant that cause allergenic dermatitis. For guidelines on removing poison oak, see the Pest Notes:\tPoison Oak. For running or golden bamboo, or arundo, it will be necessary to physically remove all the rhizomes to prevent plants from re-establishing. In general, mowing or cutting alone will not control the species listed in Table 1­ unless performed repeatedly. Rhizomes should be discarded in an area away from a water source. Cultural Control Root barriers can delay or reduce the growth of roots into areas where they are not wanted. A root barrier may consist of a hard wall of thick plastic or of fabric impregnated with herbicide, such as Biobarrier; such products may last four years or more in the landscape. Root barriers may be installed to protect structures, or they can be installed at planting to direct root growth of young plants. In the latter case, a surround-type root barrier can be used, for example, a 15-gallon nursery pot with the bottom cut out. However, no type of root barrier gives complete control; eventually roots will grow under or through the barrier and upward toward the soil surface. Although mulches are often used to control annual plants, they are not effective on herbaceous perennial or woody species that resprout from underground parts. Burning is not effective for controlling resprouting shrubs, vines, and trees. In many cases, burning can increase the population of these species. In particular, burning is not recommended for poison oak because the smoke creates a serious health hazard. Grazing by goats can provide control in small areas. Goats have been shown to vigorously feed on resprouting vegetation and shrubs, including poison oak. Overgrazing, however, can also damage desirable vegetation. As with mowing or cutting, grazing would need to be repeated over time to eventually control the resprouting plants. Biological Control Biological control agents, such as insects or diseases which might attack the root stock of an undesirable plant, are not yet available for the control of any urban woody species. Because some of these plants are desirable ornamentals in many areas, there would be considerable opposition to the introduction of biological control agents. Furthermore, some of these weedy species, including poison oak, willow, chamise, cottonwoods (poplars), and certain wild blackberries, are natives with natural control agents already present. Consequently, biocontrol is not an option for their management. CHEMICAL CONTROL In California, residents as well as landscape professionals can purchase the postemergence herbicides glyphosate, triclopyr, fluazifop, and combinations of glyphosate with triclopyr or imazapyr for control of shrubs, mature and resprouting trees, and large perennial grasses, such as arundo, bamboo, jubatagrass, and pampasgrass. Some herbicides, such as imazapyr, can have long residual activity in the soil, so replanting species that are more desirable may have to wait a year or two after treatment until residues have degraded. Depending on the compound, these herbicides can be used as cut-stump treatments, stem injections (frill or hack-and-squirt application), basal bark treatments, foliar sprays, or wick treatments (applied to leaves) (Table 2). When using herbicides, extra care must be taken to keep the material from contacting desirable plants because some of the active ingredients are nonselective and can cause serious plant injury. Also protect yourself by wearing appropriate protective equipment as stated on the herbicide label. See the Pest Notes: Pesticides: Safe and Effective Use in the Home and Landscape for more information.\tTable 2.

Application at proper growth stage. Postemergence applications are most effective after the leaves are fully developed and when the plant is actively growing. Late summer or early fall applications are often the most effective, because this is the time when perennial plants start to move nutrients (or herbicides) toward the belowground buds and roots. Avoid making applications too early in the spring or summer, or too late in the fall after the leaves have begun to turn color and senesce (age). Herbicide applications should always be made to plants that are growing rapidly and are not water-stressed. Water-stressed plants are more difficult to control with herbicides because they grow slower and do not move the herbicides very rapidly to the growing points. Therefore, targeted weeds should be watered before treatment to ensure maximum effectiveness of herbicides. 2. Spray-to-wet coverage. All leaves and stems should be glistening following foliar herbicide application. However, coverage should not be to the point of runoff. In many cases, one application of herbicide does not completely control these species. Re-treatment should be made when new leaves are fully expanded. Treated areas should be watched closely for at least a year and re-treated as necessary. For plants like pampasgrass and jubatagrass, it is possible to use a hand-held wick applicator with one part glyphosate (41% glyphosate concentrate product) in two parts water for a total of 33% dilution. The plants should be wiped at the base, with every tiller (individual stem) contacted. Wick applicators can be found online or at some garden stores. 3. Proper concentration. Generally, a higher rate of herbicide is required to control shrubs, vines, large grasses, and resprouting trees than is required to kill seedlings of herbaceous plants. However, too high a rate may kill the conducting tissues in the plant before the herbicide reaches the belowground buds. This may result in killing the aboveground portion of the plant, but allow recovery of underground reproductive parts such as rhizomes. With most of these herbicides, a solution of 1% to 2% of the concentrated product (41% active ingredient) is appropriate for foliar spray applications for homeowner use (up to 10% for professional applicators) when made during the proper growth stage to plants not under water stress. The percent of active ingredient can differ depending on the product formulation. This percentage is listed on the product label, and will affect how much water you need to add to make a mix of 1% to 2% concentrated product. For example, for homeowners, a product with 41% glyphosate can be diluted with 50 to 100 parts water per part of product (e.g., 1 ounce of product in 50 ounces of water gives 2% product). Many herbicides are already diluted to the percentage recommended for direct use and will include the letters ‘RTU’ (ready to use) directly on the container. RTU products include some formulations containing glyphosate, triclopyr, or other mixtures. These products should not be diluted any further. For plants that produce edible fruit, such as wild blackberries, the timing of herbicide application should typically be after the fruit are gone if there is any possibility of human consumption of the berries. In some situations, there is too high a risk of human ingestion of herbicide when individuals inadvertently pick and eat ripe fruit after applications are made during the earlier developmental stages of the fruit. Cut-Stump or Stem Application Cut-stump treatments are most effective during periods of active growth. Stems of shrubs, trees, vines, or bamboo should be cut close to the soil surface. Immediately after cutting, herbicide should be applied with a paint brush or with a plastic squeeze bottle. Delaying application will result in poor control. For small stumps, completely cover the cut surface. For large stumps, it is only necessary to wet the cambium (the outer ring of wood, next to and including the bark). Once dead, large stumps can either remain in place or be removed by professional arborists. For vines and small-stemmed shrubs, stems can be cut with loppers or clippers and herbicide solution painted or sponged onto the cut ends. When using loppers or clippers in this way, be sure to protect against subsequent injury resulting from the inconspicuous and sharp cut ends of dying stems by marking or covering these areas. Treatment solutions should contain 25% triclopyr or 50% glyphosate from the high concentrate solutions. If using a brand that has 18% glyphosate listed in the active ingredients, use undiluted product. If the product contains 41% glyphosate, use one part product and one part water. Regrowth from cut stumps can be sprayed when leaves fully expand. Cut-stump applications of glyphosate, triclopyr, or imazapyr (one part Stalker to three parts water; 25% solution) can sometimes injure non-targeted plants of the same species close to the treated plant. This occurs via herbicide translocation through root grafts. This type of root-grafting damage depends on the species. Rarely, if ever, does root grafting occur between plants of different species. For shrubs, vines, and small trees (>6 inches in diameter) commercial applicators can use a low volume basal bark treatment for effective control. In this treatment, an oil-soluble herbicide, such as an ester formulation of triclopyr or imazapyr, is applied in a solution of ~20% concentrated product plus 20 to 100% oil surfactant (typically a seed oil), with the remaining solution being water in the case of triclopyr and 8% solution for imazapyr with 20 to 100% surfactant. The treatment solution should be applied to the basal 18 inches of the stem or stems. Oil-soluble herbicides will penetrate through the bark with the oil and move to the vascular system, where they will then move throughout the plant. Plants should not be cut for at least a couple of months after treatment to ensure that the herbicide has thoroughly moved to the belowground growing points. Care should be taken to ensure that dead trees do not create hazards should they fall over or drop large, dead branches. Stem Injection (Frilling or Hack-and-Squirt) A hatchet or machete can be used to cut (hack) partially or completely around the trunk of a tree or the stems of a large shrub, using downward strokes to flare out (frill) the bark and cambium. Apply triclopyr, imazapyr, or glyphosate undiluted into the frill or hack marks. If hacks are used, one hack per 3 inches of stem diameter is generally adequate. As with cut-stump treatments, similar root-grafting injury can occur with stem-injection treatment.",

    "contentQuickTips": "House mice are well adapted to living in close contact with humans and thrive where food and shelter are abundant. They eat and contaminate food supplies and can also transmit disease. Their gnawing activities can damage structures or property. Manage them by cleaning up debris, removing food and shelter, eliminating entryways into buildings, or using traps or baits. High frequency electronic devices aren’t effective. How to detect a house mouse infestation: Look for droppings, fresh gnaw marks, and tracks, which indicate areas where mice are active. Search behind boxes, in drawers, in garages, or around woodpiles for nests made of finely shredded paper or other fibrous material. Check for the musky odor associated with mice. Mice are most active at night, but you also can see them during daylight hours. Discourage mice by removing food, water, and shelter and sealing entryways. Good housekeeping within buildings reduces shelter and food for house mice. Seal all structural cracks and openings larger than 1⁄4 inch. Use wire screen or coarse steel wool that mice can’t chew through. Ensure all doors, windows, and screens fit tightly. Feed pets only the amount of food they will eat at a single feeding. Keep all food storage and garbage containers sealed. Thin or remove plants next to or climbing up buildings, since house mice are excellent climbers. Remove mice from your home by trapping. Snap traps and glue boards are the safest and most economical traps. Place traps in secluded areas along walls, behind objects, in dark corners, and in places where droppings have been found. Dispose of dead rodents by burying or placing them in plastic bags and putting them in the garbage. Don’t touch mice with your bare hands, and wash hands thoroughly after handling traps. What about pesticides? Avoid using poison baits indoors. Mice can die in hidden places, create bad odors, and be difficult to locate. Seal buildings before baiting outdoors to prevent mice coming indoors to die. Baits generally take several days for effective control. Place baits in tamper-proof bait stations out of reach of children and pets and wildlife. All rodent baits are toxic. ",

    "damagePestNote": "Poison oak thrives along roadsides and other areas where established vegetation is disturbed, in uncultivated fields, and on abandoned land. It also is a problem in wood lots, Christmas tree plantations, rangeland, and recreation areas. While it can reduce optimal grazing area in rangeland or pastures, the primary concern associated with poison oak is the allergic reaction it causes in many people. All members of the genus Toxicodendron —which includes poison oak, poison ivy, and poison sumac—cause allergic contact dermatitis. About 2 million cases of skin poisoning are reported in the United States each year, primarily from these three species. In California, the number of working hours lost as a result of dermatitis from poison oak makes it the most hazardous plant in the state. Contact with poison oak leaves or stems at any time of the year can cause an allergic response. When the allergen contacts the skin surface of sensitive individuals, the surrounding cells rapidly absorb it. Within 1 to 6 days, skin irritation and itching will be followed by water blisters, which can exude serum. Contrary to popular belief, the exuded serum does not contain the allergen and does not transmit the rash to other regions of the body or to other individuals. The dermatitis rarely lasts more than 10 days. Only about 15 to 20% of the population is immune to the allergenic reaction caused by poison oak and show no symptoms when exposed to the plant. Once a reaction occurs, repeated exposures further increase sensitivity. Conversely, long periods with no exposure will reduce an individual’s susceptibility. Animals with fur usually don’t suffer skin irritation, although a dog can develop symptoms on its nose or underbelly. Livestock can graze on the tender foliage with no adverse effects. In addition to direct contact with the plant, transmission of the allergen can occur by touching contaminated clothing, gloves, tools, or animals, particularly pets. When poison oak is burned, the oils can disperse via the smoke particles. Breathing this smoke can cause severe respiratory irritation. After coming in contact with the allergen, the best way to prevent skin irritation is to pour a mild solvent such as isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol over the exposed area then wash with plenty of cold water; avoid using warm water, since it enhances the penetration of the oil. If isopropyl alcohol is not available, use cold water by itself to help dilute the oil, so it no longer is as harmful. Perform these steps within five minutes of exposure. Even if it’s too late to prevent the rash, washing the skin to remove excess plant oil will keep the rash from spreading. Be sure to thoroughly wash your hands, since they serve as the major route for transferring the allergen to other parts of the body, especially the face. Using only a small amount of water or disposable hand wipes is more likely to spread the toxin than remove it. You can use soap but only if you also use copious amounts of water. If you wash with isopropyl alcohol or soap, be sure you are done working outside for the day, since these products also will remove your skin’s protective oils, which help repel the plant toxin; your body will not regenerate these protective oils for 3 to 6 hours. If re-exposure could occur within 6 hours, you will have better results washing with lots of water. The product Tecnu, which most drug stores sell, will remove the poison oak oil from your skin. You should wash the contacted areas within 2 to 8 hours after exposure. You also can use Tecnu to decontaminate laundry, pets, and tools. BIOLOGY A variety of birds will eat poison oak fruit, and establishment of this plant in new locations generally is from seeds these birds have transported. The passage of the hard-seeded fruit through the bird’s digestive tract facilitates germination by reducing the period of dormancy. Once established, the plant spreads slowly using its underground horizontal rootstocks, which actually are stem tissue. A single root system can cover a very large area, several feet in diameter. Poison oak can survive under a wide range of temperatures, elevations, soil types, moisture conditions, and light intensities. However, it is most commonly found on hillsides with shallow soils.",
    "managementPestNote": "The primary ways of managing poison oak are mechanical removal by hand pulling, which is not recommended for individuals who are sensitive to this plant, and treatment with herbicides. Maintaining a healthy cover of desirable vegetation will reduce potential invasion. This is easiest where you have available irrigation and regularly cultivated soil. Poison oak is a native species in the western United States. As such, a number of indigenous insects and pathogens already are present. Typically, biocontrol isn’t an option with a native species. Furthermore, in most areas, poison oak is not a pest, but rather a natural component of the plant community. Don’t burn poison oak, since it creates a serious health hazard and doesn’t effectively reduce infestations. Grazing by sheep and goats can be effective in small areas. Deer or horses also will graze poison oak when the foliage is young, before the plant flowers. Mechanical You can physically remove plants located in a yard or near houses through hand pulling or mechanical grubbing using a shovel or pick. It is essential to remove the entire plant including its roots. Remove plants in early spring or late fall when the soil is moist and it is easier to dislodge rootstocks. Grubbing when the soil is dry and hard usually will break off the stems, leaving the rootstocks to vigorously resprout. Detached and dried brush still can cause dermatitis, so bury or stack the plant material in an out-of-the-way location, or take it to a disposal site. Again, never burn poison oak. Ideally, anyone engaged in hand pulling poison oak should have a high degree of immunity to the allergen. Whether you are sensitive or believe you are immune, wear appropriate protective clothing, including washable cotton gloves over plastic gloves. Wash all clothing thoroughly, including shoes, after exposure. Other forms of mechanical control have not proven to be successful. Brushrakes and bulldozers often leave pieces of rootstocks that can readily resprout. In some cases, brush removal late in summer, when plants are experiencing moisture stress, can slow their ability to recover. Mowing has little effect in poison oak control, unless you perform it at least four times during the growing season. Within 2 months of germination, young plants usually have produced underground rootstocks large enough to recover from mowing damage. A single plowing is of no value and often serves to propagate the shrub. However, good seedbed preparation and planting cultivated crops for a year or more will control poison oak infestations. Chemical Control Herbicides used to control poison oak in California include glyphosate (Roundup, etc.) and the auxinic herbicides triclopyr (Garlon, Ortho Brush-B-Gon, etc.), 2,4-D (Brush Buster Woody Plant Herbicide, etc.), a combination of 2,4-D and dicamba (Spectracide Brush Killer Spray Concentrate, Spectracide Poison Ivy & Poison Oak Brush Killer, and Ortho Weed B Gon Max), or a combination of glyphosate and imazapyr (Ortho Groundclear Vegetation Killer). You can apply some of these herbicides as stump or basal applications, but all are applied as a foliar spray. Glyphosate is one of the most effective herbicides for controlling poison oak. However, effective control depends upon proper timing of the application. Apply glyphosate late in the growth cycle, after the fruit has formed but before leaves have lost their green color. If you are using hand-held equipment, you can apply glyphosate as a 2% solution in water. Products or spray mixtures containing less than 2% glyphosate may not effectively control poison oak. It is important to note that glyphosate is a nonselective compound and will damage or kill other vegetation it contacts. Auxinic herbicides such as triclopyr, 2,4-D, dicamba, and combinations of these herbicides also control poison oak. You can apply these herbicides earlier than glyphosate, when plants are growing rapidly from spring to midsummer. Triclopyr is the most effective auxinic herbicide for poison oak control. It has a wider treatment window than glyphosate, and it often gives more consistent control. Two formulations of triclopyr are available. Triclopyr amine is the least effective of the formulations and requires relatively high rates. Triclopyr ester or triclopyr ester plus 2,4-D ester gives better herbicide absorption into the foliage and is more effective. When 2,4-D is combined with dicamba, it provides much better control than if it is used alone in a 1% solution. Premixed combinations of these herbicides are available. Dicamba applied at 0.5% gives better long-term control of poison oak than 2,4-D. A new herbicide in California, imazapyr, also is very effective for controlling poison oak, but it is available for application only by licensed pesticide applicators. In forestry, two formulations are available. The water-soluble formulation (Arsenal) is effective as a foliar treatment at 1% plus a 0.25% surfactant. A similar treatment with an emulsifiable concentrate formulation (Chopper, Stalker) will control poison oak at a 2% solution in water or a 1% solution plus 5% of a methylated or ethylated seed oil. The best timing is in either spring after full leaf expansion or in mid-August through September. Stump Application Stump treatments are most effective during periods of active growth. Cut poison oak stems 1 to 2 inches above the soil surface, and immediately after cutting, treat the stump. A delay in treatment will result in poor control. Apply an herbicide such as glyphosate, triclopyr, or combinations of triclopyr with 2,4-D (or 2,4-D and 2,4-DP) with a paint brush that is 1 to 2 inches wide or with a plastic squeeze bottle that has a spout cap. Treatment solutions should contain either undiluted glyphosate (use a product that contains at least 20% glyphosate), triclopyr amine, or a 20 to 30% triclopyr ester solution mixed with 70 to 80% methylated or ethylated seed oil. Be sure to completely cover all surfaces of the stumps with the herbicide until it runs down the base of the stubs. Spray any regrowth from cut stumps with a foliar spray when the leaves fully expand. Basal Application Basal bark applications can be made almost any time of the year, even after leaves have discolored or dropped. Apply triclopyr to basal regions of poison oak using a backpack sprayer with a solid cone, flat fan, or a straight-stream spray nozzle. Thoroughly cover a 6- to 12-inch basal section of the stem, but not to the point of runoff. Foliar Sprays The effectiveness of herbicides applied to poison oak foliage depends upon the plant’s growth stage and whether spray-to-wet coverage and proper concentration occurred. Foliar application is most effective after leaves are fully developed and when the plant is actively growing. This period is normally from April into June or July, when soil moisture is still adequate. The flowering stage is the optimum time to spray. Do not apply herbicides before plants begin their spring growth or after the leaves have begun to turn yellow or red in late summer or fall. To achieve spray-to-wet coverage, all leaves and stems should be glistening following herbicide application. However, coverage should not be to the point of runoff. One application of an herbicide usually doesn’t completely control poison oak. Treat again when new, sprouting leaves are fully expanded, generally when the plants are about 2 feet tall. Watch treated areas closely for at least a year, and re-treat as necessary.",

    "damagePestNote": "The scrambling habit of Himalaya and the other vining wild blackberries smothers existing plant growth. In addition, the tangled mass of thorny stems blocks access of humans, livestock, equipment, and vehicles to pastures and waterways. In addition, it can host Pierce's disease and serve as a vector to movement of the pathogen to other agricultural and nonagricultural areas, including riparian sites. In forest areas, timber-logging operations create large open areas that wild blackberries often invade. When grazed, the thorny stems can injure the nasal passages of livestock. Another undesirable aspect of vining blackberry plants is they are a good source of food and shelter for rats. BIOLOGY Many animal species feed on wild blackberries; consequently, seeds spread easily from one area to another in animal droppings. Wild blackberry seeds have a hard seed coat and can remain dormant for an extended period. Once seeds germinate and grow and the plants become established, expansion of the thicket is almost entirely a result of vegetative growth from rhizomes. Over time a single plant can cover a very large area. Wild blackberry plants can live for 25 years or longer. They produce vines that arise from a central crown or from buds that form along rhizomes. First-year canes don't produce flowers. In the second year, the canes fruit and die. Tips of first-year canes that contact the ground form roots at the nodes, contributing to the lateral expansion of the plant. Bumblebees and honey bees are the primary pollinators of wild blackberry flowers. The flowers can be self-pollinated, but cross pollination increases fruit set.",
    "managementPestNote": "Wild blackberries are able to regenerate from the crown or rhizomes following mowing, burning, or herbicide treatment. This makes them difficult to control, and control measures often require follow-up treatment. Land managers often rely on a combination of mechanical and chemical control methods followed by a prescribed burn to dispose of vegetative material. Because of the extensive underground root system, digging out the plants in a home landscape is a difficult undertaking. Home gardeners generally must rely on foliage-applied herbicide treatments to control an infestation of wild blackberries. One nonchemical option in the home landscape is the use of a rototiller to till the ground several times after the canes have been removed. Mechanical Control Tillage Because repeated tillage easily controls wild blackberries, they aren't a problem in cultivated agricultural systems. A single cultivation, however, can fragment the rhizomes and spread the weed. Bulldozing also can cause resprouting and can spread the weed by fragmenting roots and stems. Mowing Mowing isn't an effective method for controlling wild blackberries. In many cases it stimulates the formation of suckers from lateral roots and induces branching. Despite the lack of long-term control, mowing or chopping can provide short-term canopy reduction that will encourage the growth of grasses and broadleaf plants. Burning Burning, like mowing, isn't an effective long-term strategy, because wild blackberry plants vigorously resprout from rhizomes. However, like mowing, it also provides short-term canopy reduction. Biological Control Because many Rubus species are native or of economic importance, biocontrol isn't a practical control method in California. In Australia, however, blackberry leaf rust (Phragmidium violaceum) has been released for control of the weed. Thus far this program has not been successful, because the rust hasn't caused significant damage to its host. The rust was discovered in Oregon in the early 2000s and appeared to cause some damage to Himalaya blackberry populations. However, it has not maintained that level of injury and hasn't become widespread in California. Chemical Control Blackberry plants usually regrow following herbicide application; thus, repeated treatments might be necessary for effective long-term control. Herbicides applied to the soil In noncrop areas, tebuthiuron (Spike) is registered for use by licensed applicators for brush control. Tebuthiuron is a nonselective urea herbicide that is used for total control (i.e., it eliminates other vegetation in the treatment area) of shrubs, trees, and other weeds. It can be applied in a pelleted formulation at the base of the plant to provide long-term control of wild blackberries. Herbicides applied to the plant Herbicides can be used in rangeland, pastures, noncrop areas, along roadsides, and in right-of-ways to control actively growing wild blackberry plants. To effectively control blackberries during the growing season, an herbicide must be transported within the plant to the rhizomes and new growing points. For this to occur, the herbicide must move in the phloem with the plant sugars produced through photosynthesis. In early summer during the rapid extension of canes and expansion of foliar tissue, sugars are transported within the plant from the underground storage tissues to the shoots. After midsummer, new growth is reduced in wild blackberry first-year canes (nonflowering shoots), because these shoots are actively transporting sugars to the rhizomes. These sugars are stored for the following year's growth. In the flowering shoots (second-year canes), movement of sugars from the shoots to the rhizomes occurs later in the season than it does for first-year canes and is most active after completion of fruiting. Time a foliar herbicide application so that it coincides with the maximum rate of sugar movement to the root system. This will depend upon whether the plants are primarily first-year canes or a combination of both first- and second-year canes. In a situation where only first-year canes are present (for example when plants have been burned or mowed), the most effective time for optimal herbicide transport to the root system is in late summer. Herbicide application at this time reduces the likelihood of regrowth in subsequent years. Where the bramble infestation consists primarily of second-year canes or a combination of first- and second-year canes, apply an herbicide in early fall, before plants become dormant. Herbicides applied too early generally result in good kill of the top growth but very little movement of the chemical to the root system. Consequently, the plant regrows. Plants stressed from drought or grazing don't translocate sugars as rapidly as do actively growing plants. Thus, chemical control of wild blackberry plants under stress is difficult and not recommended. Foliar-applied herbicides Herbicides used to control wild blackberry during the growing season include glyphosate, dicamba, dicamba/2,4-D combinations, and triclopyr. Of these, glyphosate (Roundup and other products containing glyphosate) and triclopyr (Brush-B-Gon, Blackberry and Brush Killer) are registered for use by home gardeners. Glyphosate formulated into a product with 41% active ingredient (a.i.) can provide good to excellent control of wild blackberries when applied in a 0.5 to 1.5% solution (i.e., about 0.6 to 2 ounces of product per gallon of water).\tOne product available for use in the home landscape with this concentration of active ingredient is Roundup Super Concentrate. In natural areas, Roundup Pro is commonly used, and in riparian sites near water, the formulations Aquamaster and Rodeo are registered. Glyphosate products that have a lower concentration of active ingredient, such as Roundup Concentrate (18% a.i.), will require a 1.5 to 3.5% solution (i.e., about 2 to 4.5 ounces per gallon of water) for effective control.\tLate summer or early fall treatments give better control than treatments before or during flowering. To obtain good control, however, complete foliage coverage (spray-to-wet) is essential; spray the plant until it is thoroughly wet but not to the point of runoff. Burning or mowing 40 to 60 days after spraying with glyphosate increases the level of control and also contributes to good pasture establishment by removing stem debris.\tShoots recovering from sublethal glyphosate treatment tend to die more quickly when subjected to heavy grazing. Be sure to wait at least two weeks before grazing after treatment if less than 10% of the area was treated. If more than 10% of the area was treated, animals can't be grazed on the land until eight weeks following treatment.\tDicamba alone (Banvel, Vanquish) or plus 2,4-D applied in late summer gives good control of wild blackberries. However, 2,4-D alone provides only fair control and will result in resprouting. Triclopyr is available to licensed applicators for commercial use in either amine (Garlon 3A) or ester (Garlon 4) formulations.\tTriclopyr ester (0.75 to 1% solution) is the most effective formulation of triclopyr on thimbleberry and the other three species of wild blackberries. Absorption of the herbicide into the foliage isn't as good with the amine form. Nevertheless, it also provides good control when applied at a 1% solution.\tThe best time to apply either form of the herbicide is midsummer. When air temperatures are higher than 80°F, it is best to use the amine formulation, because the ester form is subject to vaporization.\tThe timing for control of wild blackberries with triclopyr is somewhat earlier than that recommended for glyphosate. Like glyphosate, apply triclopyr spray-to-wet on the foliage.\tSometimes glyphosate and triclopyr (1% solution each) are used in combination to achieve better control.\tTriclopyr is available in retail stores for use in the home landscape in products formulated at a lower concentration than those available to licensed applicators. Carefully read and follow the label of these products (Brush-B-Gon Concentrate, Blackberry and Brush Killer) to apply the correct amount to plants.\tBasal bark treatment Concentrated forms of triclopyr (often mixed with commercially available seed oils for better penetration) can be applied to basal regions of wild blackberries with a backpack sprayer using a solid cone, flat fan, or a straight-stream spray nozzle. Thoroughly cover a 6- to 12- inch basal section of the stem with spray but not to the point of runoff. Basal bark applications can be made almost any time of the year, even after leaves have senesced (aged, dried, and fallen from plant). In areas where people frequently harvest the fruit of wild blackberries, a midfall basal bark treatment might be desirable to avoid human contact with the chemical. Dormant stem and leaf treatment As an alternative to basal bark treatments, a 1% solution of triclopyr ester can be applied to dormant leaves and stems in late fall and winter in a 3% crop oil concentrate mixture; see product labels for the rate to use to obtain the desired concentration. As with other herbicide applications, spray the plant until it is thoroughly wet but not to the point of runoff. Like basal bark treatments, the timing of this technique prevents human contact with the herbicide during berry-picking season.",

    "managementPestNote": "The primary method of managing spurges is prevention, since controlling these weeds is very difficult once plants have established themselves. Avoid bringing seeds into uninfested areas by using weed-free planting seed and uncontaminated planting stock. Clean work clothing and machinery such as lawn mowers to remove any seeds that might be present, and remove spurge plants as soon as you discover them. Cultural Control Weeding or cultivating Constantly monitor infested areas, so you can mechanically till or hand pull new plants before they produce seed. Take care as you weed, since plants that you hand pull often break at the stem, leaving the root and several buds or a single stem from which regrowth is possible. Wear gloves when you hand pull, since the sap can be a skin irritant. Mowing is an ineffective method of control, since most species grow closely to the ground. When planting new, container-grown ornamentals and ornamental beds, be sure to use sterilized or weed-free planting mix. When purchasing plants for ornamental beds, avoid those with spotted spurge infestations. Mulches can effectively limit spotted spurge if they prevent light from reaching the seed. Solarization Before planting an area with turf or ornamentals, you might want to follow the management method known as soil solarization. Covering the soil with sheets of clear plastic for 4 to 6 weeks during the summer can effectively reduce the number of seeds in areas where summer daytime temperatures are very hot. In areas where summer temperatures are lower than 90°F, soil solarization can partially control this weed. For more information, see Soil Solarization for Gardens & Landscapes. Mulch Probably the most common strategy for controlling weeds in ornamental plantings is to use organic or synthetic mulches, which prevent light from reaching weed seeds and seedlings, starving them before they can start making food through photosynthesis. Bark, compost, or straw laid at least 2 inches thick can effectively control many weed seeds including many spurge species. A large, coarse bark will require a 3- to 4-inch layer to be effective; however, larger, coarser mulches last longer than finely shredded ones. Thick mulch eventually can accumulate soil, decaying organic matter, and weed seeds that can germinate. All organic mulch needs periodic replacement. Black, synthetic polypropylene weed barriers (fabrics or geotextiles), which are available at nurseries, also block sunlight and starve weed seedlings. The fabrics are porous to allow water to drain through them. Often a synthetic barrier with bark or rock on top makes the area more aesthetically pleasing. Organic mulches such as bark and straw don't need to be as thick if you also are using the fabric. Since mulches and weed barriers reduce evaporation from the soil surface, adjust the irrigation cycle to prevent overwatering. Turf managment One of the best control measures for spotted spurge in turf is to maintain a competitive stand of grass. When open areas develop in turf due to stress, disease, lack of fertility, insects, or abuse, light penetrates to the soil surface, allowing spotted spurge to germinate. Once spotted spurge establishes itself, altering cultural practices such as fertilization or irrigation won't control it. However, raising the mowing height to 2 inches or more in tall fescue or perennial ryegrass can reduce initial invasions. Check turf for excessive thatch, which should be less than 1/2 inch high. Food Crops In home vegetable gardens, you can control spurge seedlings by using soil solarization, mulches, and early cultivation. Chemical Control Preemergent herbicides Preemergent herbicides can help prevent spotted spurge outbreaks if you apply them in late winter before weed seeds germinate. Time the application, so it occurs before the soil temperature exceeds 55° to 60°F at a depth of 1 inch. Preemergent herbicides for turf and ornamentals include benefin (Balan), pendimethalin (Pendulum), isoxaben (Gallery), oryzalin (Surflan), trifluralin (Treflan, Preen), and dithiopyr (Dimension). Of these, only pendimethalin, trifluralin, dithiopyr, and oryzalin are available for use by home gardeners. Combination products such as oryzalin plus benefin are available to both home gardeners and landscape professionals. Preemergent chemicals are almost never used in home vegetable gardens, because chemical residues last for months after application, and product labels routinely regulate against such use. Herbicide recommendations for commercial orchard and vegetable crops are available online; see the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines . Postemergent herbicides Postemergent herbicides available to home gardeners include 2,4-D/MCPP/dicamba combination products, triclopyr (Turflon), and glyphosate (available for both commercial and home landscape use). In general, 2,4-D and its combinations don't control the larger, more mature spotted spurge plants.",

In 1895 Russian thistle moved to the Pacific Coast in contaminated railroad cars that transported cattle to Lancaster in California’s Antelope Valley. Today it is common throughout the western United States—having invaded about 100 million acres. It is particularly well adapted to California’s climate of winter rainfall and summer drought. Russian thistle is primarily a weed in sites where the soil has been disturbed, such as along highways and fencelines. It is also prevalent in vacant lots and other noncrop areas, in field and vegetable crops, and in poorly tended landscapes. It is rarely a problem in well-managed gardens or turfgrass.",
    "damagePestNote": "In late fall and early winter, this troublesome pest becomes conspicuous as it breaks from the soil and is blown across highways and fields. Although Russian thistle, or tumbleweed, conjures up images of the old West, it can be a serious weed pest. In agricultural areas, Russian thistle can reduce yield and quality of numerous crops, particularly alfalfa and small grains. It depletes soil moisture, interferes with tillage operations, and serves as a shelter or food source to many insects, vertebrate pests, and crop diseases such as curly top, which affects many crops including potatoes and beans. Russian thistle can also threaten native plant ecosystems. Large plants can reduce highway safety by obstructing views along right-of-ways and causing drivers to swerve their cars in an attempt to avoid colliding with windblown plants. In many areas, plants accumulate along tree rows and fencelines, posing a serious fire hazard that necessitates hours of manual labor for cleanup and disposal. It has been reported that prairie wildfires can spread rapidly when ignited balls of burning Russian thistle blow through grasslands. Russian thistle is a major problem along the California aqueduct where it can interfere with water delivery and pumping systems. Many people are sensitive to Russian thistle and exhibit skin rashes and allergic reactions after exposure to the plant. A slight scratch or abrasion from the plant may result in itching or reddened patches of skin. The windblown pollen of Russian thistle can cause an allergic reaction in people during summer.",
    "managementPestNote": "Biological control. Control of Russian thistle is difficult. There have been numerous attempts through the years to import biological control agents, such as insects, but none have been successful. The biological control agents have become established but do not provide sufficient control. However, there is hope on the horizon. There is recent interest in the introduction of a blister mite, Aceria salsolae, for Russian thistle control. A native to the Mediterranean Basin, this mite is known to attack only Russian thistle and stunts it by killing the growing tips. Several other potential biological control agents, such as a seed-feeding and stem-boring caterpillar and two different weevils are also under investigation. Management in the Home Landscape Cultural control practices such as mowing or destroying young plants by other means can prevent seed production. Avoid discing or loosening the soil in abandoned areas because loose soil is necessary for Russian thistle germination and is therefore likely to aggravate the situation. Burning is sometimes used to destroy accumulated Russian thistle plants. While this may eliminate the accumulated organic debris and some seed, much of the seed will already have been disseminated. Planting competitive, more desirable species can be an effective method of preventing Russian thistle establishment in most noncrop environments. Russian thistle competes poorly in situations with firm, regularly irrigated soil, and it is rarely a problem in managed gardens, turfgrass, or landscapes. Herbicides are rarely necessary in home gardens and landscapes for Russian thistle control. Management in Commercial and Roadside Areas Cultural practices such as those recommended for home landscapes can help control this plant along roadsides or in commercial crops. In addition, there are many herbicides that will control Russian thistle in agricultural crops and noncrop areas. Aim treatments at controlling the immature plants to prevent them from producing seed. The selection of an appropriate herbicide depends on the site or the crop. Preemergent Herbicides. Preemergent hebicides are applied to the soil before the weed seed germinates and usually incorporated into the soil with irrigation or rainfall. The most effective preemergent herbicides are atrazine (Aatrex), bromacil (Hyvar), chlorsulfuron (Telar), hexazinone (Velpar), imazapyr (Arsenal), napropamide (Devrinol), simazine (Princep), and sulfometuron (Oust). Other preemergent herbicides that are registered but only moderately effective in controlling Russian thistle are alachlor (Lasso), norflurazon (Predict), oryzalin (Surflan), pendimethalin (Prowl), prodiamine (Endurance), pronamide (Kerb), and trifluralin (Treflan). See the online UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines for specific materials registered for agricultural crops. Herbicide-resistant biotypes of Russian thistle have evolved in only a couple of years following treatment with chlorsulfuron (Telar) or sulfometuron (Oust). Avoid repeated use of a single herbicide or of herbicides that have the same mode of action to prevent the evolution of herbicide-resistant populations. Postemergent Herbicides. Postemergent herbicides are applied to plants, but timing is critical. For best results, these herbicides must be applied while the weed is in its early growth stages, preferably the early seedling stage, before it becomes hardened and starts producing its spiny branches. Do not use postemergent herbicides to try to control the mature seed (either on the plant or on the ground) as they are not effective for this purpose. Also, the later spiny stage of Russian thistle is not readily controlled by any postemergent herbicide. If rain or irrigation occurs after a postemergent application, additional seedlings may emerge and require future treatments. Postemergent herbicides that are effective when properly applied include dicamba (2,4-D, Banvel, or Vanquish), glufosinate (Finale, Liberty, or Rely), glyphosate (Roundup), and paraquat (Gramoxone).",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Roses in the garden and landscape grow as part of an environment that includes other plants, weather and other natural conditions, pests, and other organisms. Through careful selection of plant varieties and management of growing conditions, beautiful roses can be grown with a minimum of pest problems. Initial placement of roses into a suitable site gives plants the best opportunity for growth with minimal maintenance. Once established, roses provided with appropriate fertilizer and irrigation are less susceptible to some pest problems. Sanitation efforts such as picking up fallen leaves and winter prunings can help reduce disease severity and insect populations in spring. Weeds should also be managed to reduce competition and provide an attractive landscape. For details on insect and mite pests and their management, see Pest Notes:\tRoses: Insect and Mite Pests and Beneficials. To find out more about diseases of roses and how to prevent them, see Pest Notes:\tRoses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders . Both publications are listed in References . CULTIVAR SELECTION Roses have been cultivated in garden settings since antiquity, and Roman writings refer to the use of rose flowers for decoration and fragrance. Perhaps the earliest specific use of roses as landscape plants in the United States occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Hybrids of Rosa rugosa roses from China and Japan were extensively planted as hedges around farmsteads on the Great Plains. Although the flowers of Rosa rugosa cultivars are small, the ability of plants to survive, even in temperatures of -30°F, made them a welcome and colorful addition to the landscape. Modern roses are classified based on lineage and flowering characteristics. Hybrid teas and grandifloras were developed primarily for their large, showy flowers. Because of their profuse bloom and disease resistance, the cluster-flowered floribundas and polyanthas are more suitable for landscape use than hybrid teas and grandifloras. Hybridizing with floribunda varieties has resulted in the relatively recent development of landscape roses, also called shrub roses, which are cultivars selected specifically for use as flowering shrubs in the landscape. These varieties have enhanced disease and insect resistance and require less pruning than traditional garden varieties of roses. Planting and care are also easier because thorns are smaller and less numerous than found on traditional varieties. Because petals and spent flowers separate from the stems on their own, deadheading (the removal of old flowers) is not required, though this practice can speed up rebloom for some varieties. In cold-weather areas, the own-root propagation of landscape roses means plants can regenerate true-to-type from roots even if killed to the ground by cold temperatures. Landscape roses are available in three approximate growth forms: upright plants, mounding shrub roses, and ground covers. Some examples are listed below, but new cultivars are developed and released on an annual basis.\tUpright plants grow as medium-to-large shrubs with uniform foliage and bloom. These varieties can be used as border plantings, screens, or for vertical accents in a landscape design. Multiple plantings can be maintained as an informal hedge. Varieties include \"Flutterbye\", \"Pink Meidiland,\" \"Sevillana,\" and the \"Simplicity\" series.\tMounding shrub roses are more rambling than upright varieties. These can be used as borders and mass plantings. Varieties include \"Bonica,\" \"Lady of the Dawn,\" \"Lavender Dream,\" \"Knock Out,\" \"Scarlet Meidiland,\" and the \"Drift\" roses.\tGround covers are low-growing varieties that are useful as covers for sloping banks, borders for walkways, or cascades over walls. Some varieties reach 2 feet in height. Varieties include \"Alba Meidiland,\" \"Baby Blanket,\" \"Carefree Delight,\" \"Eyeopener,\" \"The Fairy,\" \"Flower Carpet,\" \"Ralph's Creeper,\" \"Red Ribbons,\" \"Red Meidiland,\" and \"Sea Foam.\"\tCULTURAL PRACTICES Establishment Roses are often purchased in late winter or early spring as bare-root plants. To maintain plant health prior to sale, these plants should be held in the nursery under cool conditions with their roots kept moist. Packaged plants should also be kept cool because warm temperatures hasten loss of carbohydrate reserves and contribute to gradual desiccation of wood, resulting in difficulty in establishment. After purchase, these plants should be kept shaded and moist and planted into the garden as soon as possible. Plant roses at about the same height they were growing in the production field or container, with the graft union (if present) above the soil surface. Compost should not be added to soil in most situations, since compost can affect water movement and impede drainage. Establishment from bare-root stock becomes more difficult as day temperatures rise above 70°F in late spring. To increase the percentage of survival when planting bare-root stock in May or June, mist the wood once or twice per day and place mulch around the base of the plant to increase humidity. Roses may be planted throughout the summer from nursery containers. However, the current season's stock is preferred to container stock held over from the previous year. With the exception of miniatures and smaller cultivars, roses generally do not perform well when maintained in nursery pots for more than one season. Planting sites may have full sun to partial shade; however, roses do best with 6 hours or more of direct sun. In addition, locating the plants so that they are exposed to good air movement is useful for reducing disease susceptibility. Diseases are less common in California's dry interior valleys than in areas with more humid climates. Irrigation Roses need to be irrigated in most locations in California. Drought stress leads to defoliation and sunburn of canes, and may contribute to spider mite problems. However, overwatering or poorly drained soils may lead to root disease and nutritional deficiencies. Frequency and duration of irrigation will depend on weather conditions and soil texture. Roses do best when 50% of available water is depleted between irrigations. Checking after irrigation to determine soil moisture status and rate of depletion is helpful in scheduling irrigation. Daily irrigation should not be necessary even in the desert areas of California. For example, in the Central Valley, rose plants in production fields are irrigated, at most, at 8-day intervals during the warmest months. Irrigation twice per week is usually satisfactory for roses in landscapes. Water may be supplied via overhead sprays, flood irrigation, or drip tubing. Irrigation with over-the-top delivery should take place in the morning so foliage dries during the day. Mulches help to decrease water loss from the soil through evaporation and may enhance growth of the root system. Soil and Nutritional Requirements Roses prefer well-drained soil with a pH near the neutral value of 7.0. Many California soils are still suitable despite a pH above 7.0, but the likelihood of micronutrient deficiencies becomes greater as pH increases, especially for pH values above 7.5. Roses are not salt-tolerant, so electrical conductivity (ECe) values, which measure the level of salt ions in the soil, should be less than 2.0 decisiemens per meter (dS/m). Soil test values suitable for roses are given in Table 1 . Nitrogen is the nutrient typically in shortest supply. Although nitrate levels may be lower than the suggested soil test value, this nutrient is easy to add so that a low soil level of nitrate is usually not problematic. For young landscape plantings or home gardens, adding nitrogen at the rate of 1 pound of nitrogen per 1,000 square feet (or proportionally less for smaller gardens) twice per year in spring and fall should provide an adequate amount of this nutrient. This may only be necessary if roses show symptoms of nitrogen deficiency, such as poor overall growth or chlorosis of the lower leaves. Slow-release fertilizers may be used. In locations with cold winters, use an immediate release form in early fall to allow for proper winter hardening of the plants. For sandy soils and for soluble fertilizers, split the seasonal application into two parts, 1 month apart. For mature plantings, adding nitrogen only in spring may be sufficient. Too much nitrogen may shift plants into vegetative growth at the expense of flowers. Although tissue tests are not normally needed for roses in landscape settings, they may be used to provide information on the current nutritional status of the rose plant. Suggested nutrient levels are presented in Table 2 .\nTable 1. Suggested soil pH, electrical conductivity (ECe), and nutrient levels for growing roses.\nSoil characteristics\tUnit\tLow\tHigh\npH (acidity/alkalinity)\t—\t6.0\t7.5\nECe (electrical conductivity)\tdS/m\t0.5\t2.0\nNO3-N (nitrate-N)\tppm\t35\t150\nNH4-N (ammoniacal-N)\tppm\t0\t20\nP (phosphorus)\tppm\t5\t50\nK (potassium)\tppm\t50\t300\nCa (calcium)\tppm\t40\t200\nMg (magnesium)\tppm\t20\t100\nB (boron)\tppm\t0.1\t0.75\nFe (iron)\tppm\t0.3\t3.0\nMn (manganese)\tppm\t0.2\t3.0\nCu (copper)\tppm\t0.001\t0.5\nZn (zinc)\tppm\t0.03\t3.0\nMo (molybdenum)\tppm\t0.01\t0.10\nTable 2.

Pruning requirements vary among types of rose plants. Hybrid teas, grandifloras, and many floribundas benefit from annual pruning in which most top growth and dead wood is removed leaving 3 to 5 canes in a vase-shaped configuration. Landscape varieties may be hedged or left unpruned, although rejuvenation pruning or removal of older stems and dead wood every 2 to 3 years will renew vigor in the planting. In most of California, pruning should be done in winter before buds swell, although it may be delayed where late spring frosts are common. A starting point in pruning is to remove diseased and damaged wood. Between one- to two-thirds of healthy wood may be removed through a combination of heading and thinning cuts, which ideally should be within 1/4 inch above outwardly growing lateral buds or branches. Removal of more wood results in fewer but larger flowers with longer stems suitable for cut flowers. Less pruning preserves the size of plants and results in a greater number of smaller flowers which can result in a pleasing landscape display. Pruning paint or other wound dressings are not necessary. During the growing season, the rule-of-thumb for cutting blooms on first-year plants is to make the cut above the first outwardly-facing 5-leaflet leaf. On well-established plants, cut blooms somewhat lower to ensure new canes can support the weight of the blooms. Removal of spent rose blossoms allows the plant to conserve energy and leads to further flower production. To deadhead a rose plant, use the same guidelines as those for cutting blooms.",

    "managementPestNote": "Weeds are common in many landscape situations including around rose plantings. Mulching with 2 to 4 inches of organic material such as wood chips will reduce annual weeds and make hand-weeding easier. Woven landscape fabrics placed under organic mulch will provide weed control for several years. In most home gardens, mulches supplemented with regular hand-weeding or rogueing (digging out the entire plant, roots and all) should provide satisfactory weed control. Mechanical cultivation devices such as hoes must be used with care because roses are shallow-rooted. In extensive plantings or professionally managed public or commercial landscapes, mulches and hand-weeding can be supplemented with herbicides. Some of the herbicides below may be available only to professional applicators and not to home gardeners. Be sure to consult current product labels for permitted sites and rates. Preemergence herbicides can be used around roses before weeds emerge or after weeds are removed, but before others germinate. While these herbicides primarily control grasses, they also control broadleaf plants such as chickweed, fiddleneck, knotweed, lambsquarters, pigweed, prostrate spurge, oxalis (from seed), and purslane. These herbicides will not control established weeds. The preemergence herbicides oryzalin (Surflan) and pendimethalin (Pendulum) were effective in field trials and did not injure roses. To control established grasses, the postemergence herbicides fluazifop-p-butyl (Fusilade) and clethodim (Envoy) were effective in field trials. When these herbicides are used according to label directions, they will not injure rose plants. Roses are sensitive to postemergence broadleaf herbicides that may be used in landscapes, such as 2,4-D, triclopyr, and dicamba; these should not be used in or near planting beds with roses. Generally, use broadleaf herbicides with great care when rose plants are present in nearby landscapes so as not to cause damage from drift. Roses are also very sensitive to glyphosate (Roundup and many other trade names), which can be absorbed through the green stems in addition to the leaves. Glyphosate damage may appear at budbreak the following spring after a summer or fall application that contacts leaves or stems; symptoms include a proliferation of small, narrow shoots and leaves. For more information on weed control in the landscape, see Pest Notes:\tWeed Management in Landscape s listed in References .",

    "damagePestNote": "A typical puncturevine plant will produce 200 to 5,000 seeds during one growing season, depending on available soil moisture and other environmental factors. These seeds and those that did not germinate from previous seasons will contribute to the potential weed population the following year. With its deep taproot, puncturevine competes aggressively for water and nutrients in tree and field crops and turf. Puncturevine in hay will markedly reduce the quality of the product. When allowed to grow unchecked, puncturevine will develop into a thick mat, hiding the sharp burrs. Even under limited growth conditions, puncturevine's prolific production of the seed burrs creates dangerous conditions for livestock, people, and pets. Grazing livestock in areas infested with puncturevine is not recommended. The sharp spines of the seed burr can injure the mouth and digestive tract or feet of animals. Puncturevine can be particularly toxic to sheep, causing sensitivity to light resulting in skin lesions and swelling of ears and lips. Severe effects include blindness, necrosis of skin, loss of lips and ears, and death in young animals. Additionally, puncturevine may contribute to nitrate poisoning in sheep and cattle. Symptoms of nitrate poisoning include labored breathing, staggering, tongue and the white of the eyes turning blue, and loss of appetite.",
    "managementPestNote": "Long-term control of puncturevine can be achieved by reducing the amount of seeds in the soil. This is best accomplished by removing plants before they produce seeds (i.e., before or at flowering) and continuing to do so over several years. Burrs that have dropped after removing the plant may be collected and removed by sweeping or raking the ground. Even patting the ground with a piece of carpet will help collect the burrs. Biological control from two introduced weevils is also very effective, but there may be resurgences every few years as the number of the weevils decline along with the population of the puncturevine. The primary method of management for puncturevine in the home landscape and garden is removal of seedlings and older plants by hand or hoeing, taking care to also remove any burrs that fall off the plant. Avoid bringing puncturevine into uninfested areas on shoes and the wheels of mowers or carts. Cultural and Mechanical Control In most situations, puncturevine is best controlled by hand removal or by hoeing to cut the plant off at its taproot. Monitoring the area and removing the weed throughout the late spring and into the summer will greatly reduce the impact of the weed the next year. Shallow tilling (about 1 inch deep) of seedlings or small plants can be effective in larger areas. Deeper tilling is not recommended since this may bury seeds and they may be able to germinate for several years afterwards. Hand removal, hoeing, or cultivation should be initiated prior to flowering and seed production. Mowing is not an effective method of control since the plant grows low to the ground. Mulches can be used to control common puncturevine in ornamental plantings, orchards, vineyards, vegetable crops, and gardens, if they screen out all light. To be effective, organic mulches should be at least 3 inches thick. However, puncturevine burrs that fall onto mulch surfaces can establish on the mulch surface due to the puncturevine’s deep taproot. Synthetic mulches, which screen out light and provide a physical barrier to seedling development, also work well. Aeration of compacted sites and planting competitive desirable plants can also reduce the impact of puncturevine by making the area more favorable for the growth of the desired plants and reducing resources available to the weed. Biological Control Two weevils, Microlarinus lareynii and M. lypriformis, native to India, France, and Italy, were introduced into the United States as biocontrol agents in 1961. Microlarinus lareynii is a seed weevil that deposits its eggs in the immature burr or flower bud and the larvae feed on and destroy the seeds before they pupate and emerge as adults, disperse, and start the cycle over again. Generation time is 19 to 24 days in the summer in southern California. Microlarinus lypriformis is a stem weevil that has a similar life cycle except that it lays its eggs in the undersides of stems, branches, and the root crown. The larvae tunnel in the pith where they feed and pupate. The adults emerge from holes chewed in the upper surfaces of the stems, branches, and crowns. Adults of both species overwinter in plant debris. Although the stem weevil is slightly more effective than the seed weevil when each is used alone, the weevils are most effective if used together and the puncturevine is moisture-stressed. Both species of weevils are available for purchase from biological control suppliers but purchase and release is not generally recommended because weevils collected from other areas may not survive at your location. In most California counties where releases would be beneficial, county agricultural commissioners have release programs or can direct you to collection sites where you may be able to collect them yourself. Contact your county agricultural commissioner's office for more information. Chemical Control Chemical control is generally not necessary for the control of puncturevine in the home landscape. However, in large areas, or places where there was a heavy infestation in previous years so that it’s difficult to remove by hand, hoeing, or tilling, herbicides may be used to control puncturevine. There are few preemergent herbicides that are effective. Products containing oryzalin, benefin, or trifluralin will provide partial control of germinating seeds. These must be applied prior to germination (late winter to midspring). After plants have emerged from the soil (postemergent), products containing 2,4-D, glyphosate, and dicamba are effective on puncturevine. The smaller or younger the plant, the better the postemergent herbicides work. Dicamba and 2,4-D will injure most broadleaf plants so it is important that they only be applied to the weeds and drift is minimized. They can be applied to lawns without injuring the desired grass. Glyphosate will kill or injure most plants so it should only be used as spot treatments or on solid stands of the weed.",

    "damagePestNote": "In grazing areas, poison hemlock can crowd out more desirable forage species, and its toxicity causes serious livestock losses when animals feed on fresh forage, harvested silage, or, to a lesser degree, contaminated hay. Silage does little to reduce the plant's toxicity. Poison hemlock can also be found in grain fields, where it can contaminate harvested seed and invade perennial crops. In alfalfa, it poses a significant problem only in the first cutting. Subsequent regrowth of alfalfa can suppress regrowth of poison hemlock. While poison hemlock can be a major weed of roadsides and some crops, it isn't a common garden and landscape invader. Poison hemlock is toxic to both humans and livestock, affecting the central nervous and reproductive systems. Cases of human poisoning are comparatively rare and are generally associated with children using the hollow stems as flutes or adults mistakenly confusing poison hemlock with an edible plant such as parsley, parsnip, or anise. Sensitive people may experience contact dermatitis when handling this plant. Eight known alkaloids contribute to poison hemlock's toxicity. Environmental conditions such as soil moisture, soil type, temperature, and the season of growth can alter the plant's alkaloid composition and concentration, making it difficult to predict the degree of toxicity of a given plant or contaminated product. Animals tend to avoid poison hemlock when other forage is available. They typically feed on the plant only when forage options are limited or when poison hemlock has contaminated green chop, silage, or hay. All classes of livestock and wildlife are susceptible to poison hemlock from ingestion, including cattle, horses, pigs, goats, sheep, elk, and turkeys. Of the domesticated animals, cattle, goats, and horses are the most sensitive. A lethal dose in horses and cattle is as low as 0.25 to 0.5% (fresh plant weight) of the animal's body weight. Sheep and pigs are somewhat less susceptible. Symptoms of poisoning include nervousness, trembling, knuckling at the fetlock joints, ataxia, dilation of the pupils, a weak and slow heartbeat, coma, and eventually death from respiratory paralysis. These symptoms can occur within 30 to 40 minutes in horses and 1 1/2 to 2 hours in cattle and sheep. Central nervous system toxicity in livestock usually occurs in spring when poison hemlock is among the first green plants to emerge. This is also when concentrations of some of the most potent alkaloids are at their highest. In fall, regrowth or newly germinated poison hemlock may be the last green forage available. In the western United States, this time coincides with the critical period of gestation in many animals, and ingestion can cause fetal deformity (i.e., crooked calf disease) in pregnant cattle, pigs, or goats. Winter poisonings are also common when cattle are fed harvested hay. Some of poison hemlock's alkaloid compounds have the ability to pass into milk when animals feed on sublethal amounts of this plant, which can adversely alter the flavor and safety of milk used for human consumption.",
    "managementPestNote": "Most management strategies are designed to reduce the incidence of poisoning in livestock. When poison hemlock infestations are present, injury can be minimized by preventing grazing in areas where the plant is the only available forage or by removing pregnant livestock from infested areas at the most susceptible period of the animal's gestation. It is important to prevent a small-scale infestation of poison hemlock from becoming a more significant problem. This can be accomplished by periodically inspecting the area for newly established plants. Once identified, remove individual plants by hand pulling, hoeing, or spot application of an herbicide. Wear gloves to minimize direct contact with the toxic sap. It is essential to prevent isolated plants or a small cluster of plants from producing seed. Don't burn plants or plant debris, because burning may release toxins into the air. Use certified weed-free hay in order to prevent poisoning livestock. Mechanical Control Hand removal is recommended for small infestations. When pulling the plants, the entire taproot should be removed to prevent regrowth. However, care must be taken with manual control to minimize soil disturbance that can encourage further germination of seeds at infested sites. Solid carpets of hemlock seedlings aren't uncommon following soil disturbance. Plowing or repeated cultivation of newly germinated plants will prevent poison hemlock establishment. In areas where cultivation isn't practical or possible, repeated mowing once the plants have bolted but before they have flowered can reduce further seed production. Routine mowing reduces poison hemlock's competitive ability, depletes its energy reserves in the taproot, and prevents seed production. Close mowing has the additional advantage of reducing the amount of toxic leaf material available for livestock grazing. Biological Control The European palearctic moth Agonopterix alstroemeriana is the main herbivore feeding on poison hemlock. This moth was probably introduced by accident, and poison hemlock is considered its only known host plant. The larvae live in conspicuous leaf rolls and feed on foliage, buds, and flowers in spring and early summer. The adult moths emerge in summer and can be found from June until March of the following year. Despite its widespread occurrence, the moth hasn't been shown to be an effective control agent for most infestations of poison hemlock. Chemical Control Although several herbicides are available for controlling poison hemlock, herbicides should be used only on seedlings or small rosettes and not on fully mature plants. In addition, it is best to handpull individual plants or small infestations, which are typical of gardens and landscapes. Herbicides such as 2,4-D, triclopyr, and glyphosate, available to both residential users and small noncommercial operations, may be a more effective option with larger infestations. In California, herbicides such as chlorsulfuron, hexazinone, and imazapyr are available to licensed applicators. The broadleaf selective herbicide 2,4-D is most effective when applied soon after plants reach the rosette stage. Both the amine and ester formulations of 2,4-D are effective. Using 2,4-D may make poison hemlock more attractive to livestock but doesn't change its toxicity, so some caution must be exercised if using 2,4-D in grazed pastureland or in silage production. Like 2,4-D, triclopyr is also a broadleaf selective herbicide that is most effective on smaller plants. It doesn't kill most grasses. Apply it during the seedling to rosette stage of growth. Glyphosate is nonselective, so exercise caution to minimize injury or mortality of desirable plants that might help suppress new poison hemlock seedlings. Apply to actively growing plants before they begin to bolt. Cooler temperatures can reduce the effectiveness of glyphosate. Chlorsulfuron is somewhat selective against broadleaf weeds and not only gives excellent preemergent control but can also provide some postemergent foliar activity on poison hemlock. Desirable grasses should be well established before application. Apply chlorsulfuron to actively growing poison hemlock plants in the rosette stage. Other preemergent photosynthetic inhibitors, such as hexazinone, give excellent control of poison hemlock. In alfalfa, herbicides should be applied when the forage crop is dormant. Treating poison hemlock with herbicides may require repeated applications for a couple of years until the seedbank has been significantly depleted. Once the weed is under control, maintaining desirable forage species with proper pasture management, fertilization, irrigation, and drainage can effectively help prevent reinfestations.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Broadleaf and buckhorn plantain (Plantago major and P. lanceolata) are two major perennial weeds in California. These weeds can be found in turfgrass, ornamental plantings, gardens, roadsides, and pastures. Both species are found throughout the state and grow year-round, except in the coldest intermountain areas and deserts. The genus Plantago consists of about 250 species worldwide, with 20 species found in California. Both broadleaf and buckhorn plantain were introduced from Europe. Broadleaf plantain is also known as common plantain and dooryard plantain. Other names for buckhorn plantain include narrow-leaf plantain, ribwort plantain, English plantain, and ribgrass.",

    "damagePestNote": "This weed may form dense populations of individual plants that compete with desirable plant species. Established plantains produce seed and vegetative structures that can contaminate equipment and spread to new areas. In turfgrass, plantains may form dense clumps that damage and reduce usability of athletic fields and golf courses. The texture and color of plantain may also disrupt aesthetic quality of turfgrass. Broadleaf plantains are better adapted to irrigated areas where management levels involve frequent mowing or grazing. Broadleaf plantain is an indicator weed of alkaline soils (high soil pH) with low fertility and soil compaction. Buckhorn plantains are better adapted to areas with less irrigation and mowing. Buckthorn plantain is an indicator of dry, low fertility soils. However, both can tolerate drought and wide environmental conditions. Both plantains have no true stems, and the leaves are clustered in a rosette at the base of the plant. Although slow to establish, plantain is difficult to control when mature because of its extensive crown system. Plantain crowns can regenerate new plants, even when cut off at or below the soil surface. Broadleaf plantain can survive for many years and develop a thickened crown 6 to 10 inches across with fibrous roots, while buckhorn plantain has a stout taproot.",
    "managementPestNote": "Remove any new plantain seedlings and more mature plants before they produce seed. Monitor the area for several months to be sure plantains don’t resprout. It is difficult to control mature plantain plants when only relying on hand-pulling, digging, or hoeing because of their persistent crowns. Mowing is not an effective control since the leaves lie close to the ground. Repeated removal of plants for several months is most successful in a home garden or lawn. To reduce the spread of plantain and other weeds, clean equipment prior to use in a new area. Turfgrass Well maintained turfgrass areas will assure a dense, healthy stand. Use best management practices such as thatch reduction, appropriate irrigation, and proper mowing height for the desired turf species. No single procedure has been successful in controlling plantain in turfgrass. Early removal of new seedlings is successful when practiced diligently. Digging out perennial plantain plants must be done regularly for several years to be successful. Once these weeds are eradicated, areas should be renovated and managed to establish a healthy turfgrass sward. Preemergence herbicides that limit germination of plantain in turfgrass are those with the active ingredients atrazine, indaziflam, isoxaben, and mesotrione. Repeated applications of postemergence broadleaf herbicides can control plantain seedlings. However, control of mature plants with herbicides is difficult; products with 2,4-D work best. Additional postemergence herbicide options include bromoxynil, carfentrazone, dicamba, mesotrione, penoxsulam, and sulfentrazone. Quinclorac provides fair control of buckthorn plantain and poor control on broadleaf plantain. Clopyralid herbicides require the highest label rate for broadleaf plantain control. Products with bispyribac-sodium, chlorosulfuron, fluroxypyr, triclopyr, MCPA, and mecoprop will only suppress, but not kill, the weed. Combinations of active ingredients can improve control. The best postemergence control is achieved from a fall herbicide application and repeat applications may be needed to kill weakened perennial weeds and new germinating seedlings. Herbicide options are summarized in Table 1. Ornamentals Prevention is important, since few options exist to control plantain in ornamental plantings. Pull weeds or spot treat with herbicides periodically during the year. Be aware that plantain regrowth from the crown system can limit effectiveness of this method. Mulch with landscape fabrics to control seedlings of both species. Overlap fabric so light cannot reach the soil surface. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or black polyethylene (plastic tarp) to block weed growth, then cover fabric with mulch to improve aesthetics. Organic mulches alone may control plantain seedlings if applied at 2 to 4 inches deep (depth varies with mulch texture). Because mulches degrade over time, reapply as necessary. Regularly inspect and hand weed ornamental areas. Preemergence herbicides to limit the growth of plantain seedlings in ornamental planting areas include isoxaben, flumioxazin, and indaziflam. Postemergence spot treatment with nonselective, systemic herbicides like glyphosate can control plantains in established ornamental plantings. Nonselective, contact herbicides like diquat, glufosinate, pelargonic acid, and products containing acetic acids, fatty acids, or plant oils can kill small seedlings, but will only damage the aboveground parts of more mature weeds. Use nonselective herbicides with care to prevent drift or overspray onto desirable plants. Herbicide options are summarized in Table 1.

    "damagePestNote": "Perennial pepperweed can rapidly form large, dense stands that displace desirable vegetation. Populations easily spread along waterways and can infest entire stream corridors, riparian areas, or irrigation structures. Flooded streams often wash away roots growing along the streambank; however, new infestations can develop downstream. Once established, perennial pepperweed is persistent and difficult to control in crops, natural areas, and ornamental plantings. Perennial pepperweed reduces forage quality in hay or pasture.",
    "managementPestNote": "Prevention is the best management strategy for avoiding problems with perennial pepperweed in and around home landscapes. If perennial pepperweed is found growing in landscaped areas, immediately control the plant before it can spread. Pulling plants (try and remove as much of the root as possible) is an effective way of controlling a few scattered plants growing within landscaped areas. Use of glyphosate (Roundup and other products) is another option, but care must be taken to avoid injuring nearby desirable plants. Large populations of perennial pepperweed are unusual in landscape areas, unless new housing or commercial developments have been built on infested land. To control perennial pepperweed infestations apply glyphosate to the entire infestation before landscaping newly developed areas. It takes a few weeks for the herbicide to translocate (move) to the roots. After the initial herbicide treatment, carry out any necessary soil preparation activities. An additional 2 to 6 months wait period is required before seeding or transplanting desired vegetation to allow any remaining pepperweed to resprout so it can be treated again. Once perennial pepperweed ceases to resprout, apply landscape fabric or mulch and transplant closely spaced herbaceous plants to prevent invasion. If resprouts grow through or around mulch barriers, hand pull or spot treat them with glyphosate. Turf is a suitable ground cover for preventing reinvasion of perennial pepperweed. A frequent mowing schedule and common herbicide (2, 4-D) used for turf management should inhibit perennial pepperweed establishment. Established perennial pepperweed populations are difficult to control and require multiple years of intensive management. Suppressing the extensive root system is critical for successful control. A management program should include prevention, monitoring, and treatment of small satellite populations before plants develop extensive roots. If large populations exist, focus management on containing the infestation and preventing further spread to surrounding areas. Prevention Prevention is the foundation of any weed management program. Techniques that prevent perennial pepperweed establishment save time and resources in the future. Perennial pepperweed root fragments or seed have been found in straw, hay bales, mulch, and crop seed; be sure that these items are free of weed seed and propagules before applying them to an area. Periodic surveys of property lines, roadsides, waterways, and riparian corridors help detect new infestations before they become well established. If construction or soil disturbance occurs in infested areas, make sure root fragments and seed are not transported to other sites. Always clean vehicles, machinery, and clothing after visiting infested areas. If livestock graze perennial pepperweed, hold the animals in closely monitored paddocks for several days to allow seed to pass through their digestive system before transporting them to new areas. Cultural Control Establishing and maintaining competitive perennial vegetation can dramatically slow the introduction and spread of perennial pepperweed. Vigorous sod-forming grasses, alfalfa, or cropping systems with annual tillage help prevent perennial pepperweed introduction and establishment in agricultural areas. Closely spaced plantings of herbaceous perennials, shade trees, and/or fabric or plastic mulches can help prevent its introduction in ornamentals.\tHand Pulling, Tillage, and Tarping Seedlings are easily controlled by hand pulling or tillage, but these techniques do not control established plants because shoots quickly resprout from the vast root reserves. Root segments as small as 1 inch are capable of producing new shoots. Perennial pepperweed is less affected by tarping and solarization than annual species due to its large perennial root structure. Research with tarping has been inconsistent. The best control with tarping was obtained using thick, black plastic secured over the infested area for two growing seasons. Mowing and tilling the site before tarping can improve control compared with mowing and tarping alone. It is important to extend the plastic tarp at least 10 feet on all sides of the infested area as creeping roots can spread laterally up to 10 feet. Tent solarization can be used to kill seeds and roots after hand pulling if disposal of pulled plants is not possible.\tMowing and burning Mowing and burning are not effective in reducing perennial pepperweed stands, but they are helpful in removing accumulated thatch. Perennial pepperweed thatch burns best in winter or spring under dry conditions before initiation of spring growth. Mowing breaks old stems into small fragments and helps prevent shading of favorable species. Mowing also stimulates perennial pepperweed plants to resprout and produce new growth. Combining mowing with herbicides has been shown to be an effective control strategy. For best results, mow plants at the flower bud stage and apply herbicides to resprouting shoots once they have reached the flower bud stage. Revegetation Establishing desirable vegetation in disturbed areas is crucial to managing perennial pepperweed and preventing future weed problems. Because perennial pepperweed is very competitive, seed or transplant desirable vegetation after dense perennial pepperweed stands are controlled. Choose vigorous, fast growing plant species that are adapted to the site. Perennial grasses are a good choice for natural areas and pastures. Grasses are tolerant of some selective herbicides used for perennial pepperweed control and over time form a thick sod that prevents future weed establishment. In pastures, promote grass expansion and vigor with fertilization and grazing management. Chemical Control Several postemergent herbicides control perennial pepperweed, but repeat applications are usually necessary for several years to treat resprouting shoots and seedlings. Extended control with herbicides is greatly enhanced by establishing competitive vegetation at the site. In areas with a dense buildup of thatch, mow or burn old shoots before applying herbicides. Herbicide application timing is critical. Herbicides work best when applied at the flower bud stage and worst at the rosette or early bolting stage. Because plant phenology differs between location and year, regularly observe infested areas in spring and begin applying herbicides when flower buds appear. If herbicide cannot be applied at the flower bud stage, mow plants and apply the herbicide to regrowth. With seedlings, apply herbicides as soon as possible to prevent plants from producing new lateral shoots from the root. Herbicide choice depends on label restrictions, land use objectives, and cost. See Table 1 for a summary of effective herbicide choices.\tTable 1. Summary of Herbicides Available to Control Perennial Pepperweed in Rangeland, Pasture, Rights-of-Way, and Crop Situations.

    "damagePestNote": "Nutsedges are a problem in lawns because they grow faster, have a more upright growth habit, and are a lighter green color than most grass species, resulting in a nonuniform turf. In gardens and landscapes, nutsedges will emerge through bark or rock mulches in shrub plantings and vegetable and flower beds throughout the growing season.",
    "managementPestNote": "The best approach for avoiding nutsedge problems is to prevent establishment of the weed in the first place. Once established, nutsedge plants are difficult to control. Prevent establishment by removing small plants before they develop tubers, eliminating the wet conditions that favor nutsedge growth, using certain fabric mulches in landscape beds, and making sure nutsedge tubers aren’t brought in with topsoil or other materials. In addition to consistently removing small plants, you can reduce nutsedge populations by drying, shading, and using properly timed applications of herbicides. Cultural Control Removing Plants and Tubers Tubers are key to nutsedge survival. If you can limit production of tubers, you’ll eventually control the nutsedge itself. To limit tuber production, remove small nutsedge plants before they have 5 to 6 leaves; in summer this is about every 2 to 3 weeks. Up to this stage, the plant hasn’t formed new tubers yet. Removing as much of the plant as possible will force the tuber to produce a new plant, drawing its energy reserves from tuber production to the production of new leaves. Continually removing shoots eventually depletes the energy reserves in the tuber, because the nutsedge will have to use 60% of its reserves to develop the first plant and 20% for the second. However, mature tubers can resprout more than 3 times. Even though these newer sprouts start out weaker than the previous ones, plants can develop from them and produce new tubers unless you remove them. The best way to remove small plants is to pull them up by hand or to hand hoe. If you hoe, be sure to dig down at least 8 to 14 inches to remove the entire plant. Using a tiller to destroy mature plants only will spread the infestation, because it will move the tubers around in the soil. However, repeated tillings of small areas before the plants have 6 leaves will reduce populations. If you find nutsedge in small patches in your turf, dig out the patch down to at least 8 inches deep, refill, and then seed or sod the patch. Drying During the middle of summer, you can control purple nutsedge by cultivating the infested area and then withholding all moisture to allow the sun to dry the tubers. Repeated tilling and drying are required to give good control. This method is effective only in areas where other plants don’t need irrigation. Drying isn’t effective for controlling yellow nutsedge. Shading Nutsedges don’t grow well in shade, so changing landscape plantings might reduce their growth. For example, a highly infested, annually planted flower bed might be better off if you replant it with a tall, dense ground cover or shrub. Low-growing ground covers won’t shade out nutsedge. Mulching The commonly used black polyethylene plastic mulches don’t control yellow or purple nutsedge, because the sharp points at the ends of their leaves can penetrate them. Landscape fabrics made from polypropylene polymers are available that effectively suppress nutsedge growth and have the added benefit of being water and air permeable, unlike polyethylene. If the planting permits, mulching with a thick, nonwoven landscape fabric covered with a bark or gravel mulch will suppress nutsedge growth. For complete control, however, you still will need to remove any emerging nutsedge plants. Chemical Control Few herbicides are effective at controlling nutsedge, either because of a lack of selectivity to other plants or a lack of uptake. For herbicides that are suitable, apply them when they’ll be most effective (Table 1). Most herbicides aren’t effective against tubers.\tTable 1. Controlling Nutsedge with Chemicals.\t(None of these products effectively controls mature plants.)\nHerbicide\tCommercial name\tApply before plants emerge\tApply to young plant\tAvailable to home gardener\ndichlobenil\tCasoron\tyes\tno\tyes\ndimethenamid-P\tFreehand\tyes\tno\tno\nglyphosate\tRoundup\tno\tyes\tyes\nhalosulfuron\tSedgehammer\tno\tyes\tyes\nmetolachlor\tPennant\tyes\tno\tno\npenoxsulam\tGreen Light Wipe Out Tough Weed Killer for Lawns\tno\tyes\tyes\nsulfosulfuron\tCertainty\tno\tyes\tno\ntrifloxysulfuron-sodium\tMonument\tno\tyes\tno\nNonselective Postemergent Herbicides The only nonselective postemergent herbicide currently available to help control nutsedge in the home landscape is glyphosate (e.g. Roundup) or glyphosate with nonaoic acid (Roundup Plus). This herbicide requires repeated applications, and its use will result only in limited suppression of these weeds. Many people mistakenly use glyphosate on fully grown plants to try to kill the tubers. Unfortunately, when tubers are mature the herbicide usually doesn’t move from the leaves to the tubers, leaving them unaffected. Instead, apply glyphosate when the plants are young, actively growing, and haven’t recently been mowed or cut. Be sure to read the label to determine how much time after application must occur before irrigation can resume. Don’t apply if rainfall is expected within 24 hours of application. Glyphosate works most quickly when the weather is warm and sunny; cool, cloudy weather following an application can delay activity. Don’t spray any herbicide when it is windy to avoid injuring other plants with spray drift. Selective Postemergent Herbicides Postemergent herbicides that have some selectivity, particularly in turf, are halosulfuron (Sedgehammer) and MSMA. These herbicides move through the plant rapidly, but to be effective, you must apply them to nutsedges before the fifth-leaf stage, when the plant is still building energy reserves by drawing energy from its leaves to the newly forming tubers. After this stage, this translocation to the tubers slows down or ceases, and the herbicide will kill only the aboveground portion of the plant, leaving the tubers unaffected. Halosul­furon is used in such minute amounts the manufacturer markets it in premeasured, water-soluble bags. Follow all label directions for optimal control of nutsedge, and be sure to add a nonionic surfactant to the spray solution. MSMA is more effective on yellow than on purple nutsedge. Other herbicides available to professionals for use on turf include trifloxysulfuron-sodium (Monument) and sulfosulfuron (Certainty). Be sure to read the label carefully, as these products will injure some turf species. Preemergent Herbicides Although no preemergents control purple nutsedge, those that reduce yellow nutsedge include dichlobenil (Casoron), metolachlor (Pennant), and dimethenamid-P (a component of Freehand). Metolachlor and dimethenamid-P are safer around many ornamentals than dichlobenil, but they are available only to professional pesticide applicators. No preemergent herbicides that effectively control nutsedge can be used on turfgrass, but you can use them on selected ornamental plants. Read the label directions to see which orna­mentals will tolerate each herbicide, and follow all label instructions regarding how to apply the product. Preemergent herbicides reduce the number of emerging nutsedge plants, but for long-term control, re-treatment is necessary.",

    "damagePestNote": "Broadleaf mistletoe absorbs both water and mineral nutrients from its host trees. Healthy trees can tolerate a few mistletoe branch infections, but individual branches may be weakened or sometimes killed. Heavily infested trees may be reduced in vigor, stunted, or even killed, especially if they are stressed by other problems such as drought or disease.",
    "managementPestNote": "In newly developed areas or in older established areas where trees are being replaced, the ideal method of controlling or preventing mistletoe is to plant trees believed to be resistant or moderately resistant to mistletoe. Avoid trees like Modesto ash, known to be especially susceptible to mistletoe infestation. Where many new trees are being planted, control mistletoe in any surrounding infected trees to reduce the infection of new trees. For treatment of existing trees it is important to remove mistletoe before it produces seed and spreads to other limbs or trees. Mechanical control through pruning is the most effective method for removal. Growth regulators provide a degree of temporary control but repeated applications are required. Severely infested trees should be removed and replaced with less susceptible species to protect surrounding trees. Mechanical Control The most effective way to control mistletoe and prevent its spread is to prune out infected branches, if possible, as soon as the parasite appears. Using thinning-type pruning cuts, remove infected branches at their point of origin or back to large lateral branches. Infected branches need to be cut at least one foot below the point of mistletoe attachment in order to completely remove embedded haustoria. Done properly, limb removal for mistletoe control can maintain or even improve tree structure. Severe heading (topping) is often used to remove heavy tree infestations; however, such pruning weakens a tree’s structure, and destroys its natural form. In some cases it is best to remove severely infested trees entirely because they are usually a source of mistletoe seed. Mistletoes infecting a major branch or the trunk where it cannot be pruned may be controlled by cutting off the mistletoe flush with the limb or trunk. Then wrap the area with a few layers of wide, black polyethylene to exclude light. Use twine or tape to secure the plastic to the limb, but do not wrap it too tightly or the branch may be damaged. In some tree species callus tissue will form under the plastic, further weakening the limb. Broadleaf mistletoe requires light and will die within a couple of years without it. It may be necessary to repeat this treatment, especially if the wrapping becomes detached or if the mistletoe does not die. Simply cutting the mistletoe out of an infested tree each winter, even without wrapping, is better than doing nothing at all. Even though the parasite will grow back, spread is reduced because broadleaf mistletoe must be several years old before it can bloom and produce seed. Chemical Control The plant growth regulator ethephon (Monterey Florel Brand) may be used as directed by the label to control mistletoe in dormant host trees. To be effective, the spray must thoroughly wet the mistletoe foliage. The ideal time to treat is in spring as temperatures begin to warm, but before the tree begins to grow new leaves. Daytime temperatures must be above 65 degrees Fahrenheit for good results. Spray only the individual mistletoe plants, not the entire tree. By treating when trees are dormant, the tree foliage will not get in the way of the treatment and the mistletoe is more visible than when leaves are on the tree. Spraying provides only temporary control, especially on well-established infestations, by causing some of the mistletoe plant to fall off. The mistletoe will soon regrow at the same point, requiring retreatment. Resistant Species Some tree species appear resistant to broadleaf mistletoe. Bradford flowering pear, Chinese pistache, crape myrtle, eucalyptus, ginkgo, golden rain tree, liquidambar, sycamore, and conifers such as redwood and cedar are rarely infested. These or other resistant species should be considered when planting in infested areas, or when replacing infested trees. Integrated Pest Management in a Community An effective mistletoe control program in a community requires a combination of methods and the cooperation of developers, homeowners, businesses, and public agencies. Property owners can substantially reduce mistletoe infestations in their own trees, but without community cooperation, infestations will recur. Public wooded areas, such as parks and stream banks adjacent to urban areas, can be a continual source of seed and, therefore, mistletoe infestation. For this reason, the planting of tree species not susceptible to mistletoe infestation should be a part of every city and park plan. The most drastic and possibly the best control measure is to remove severely infested trees and replace them with less susceptible species. Economically, tree removal could be a practical approach for both public agencies and landowners, in addition to providing a source of firewood. To assist citizens in removing mistletoe from less severely infested trees on their property, some cities loan removal tools. In other cases, neighborhood residents may pool resources to hire a tree service to remove all mistletoe in their neighborhood.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Mistletoe is a parasitic plant that absorbs both water and nutrients from a host tree. Healthy trees can tolerate a few mistletoe branch infections. However, if the infestation is severe, trees can weaken, have stunted growth or dead branches, or die completely. Symptoms are magnified on trees already stressed by drought or disease. Remove branches at least a foot below the mistletoe attachment, before it produces seeds that will infest other limbs and trees. Types of mistletoe—broadleaf and dwarf: Broadleaf mistletoes attack broadleaf trees and some conifers. Plants have green stems with thick, almost oval-shaped leaves and produce small, sticky, whitish berries in fall. Birds disperse the seeds. Dwarf mistletoes attack conifers. Plants are smaller with short stems and yellow to orange scaly leaves, resembling a juniper. Seeds mature in midsummer to late autumn and eject from the plant, traveling up to 50 feet. Mistletoe infestations weaken trees. Tree injury varies according to mistletoe and tree species. Dwarf mistletoes tend to be more damaging. Healthy oaks in natural areas can tolerate some mistletoe, but branches are more likely to break. Severely infested trees show reduced vigor, stunted growth, swellings on branches, and dead branches; some trees die completely. Drought or disease can magnify symptoms. Dwarf mistletoes cause profuse branching, or witches’ brooms, on conifers. Dead and dying limbs are a significant fire danger, especially in forested areas. If possible, select resistant tree species. Mistletoe rarely infests Bradford flowering pear, Chinese pistache, crape myrtle, eucalyptus, ginkgo, golden rain tree, liquidambar, sycamore, cedar, or redwood. Avoid especially susceptible varieties such as alder, Aristocrat flowering pear, and Modesto ash. Diversify infested conifer stands by replanting with different nonsusceptible species. Most dwarf mistletoes attack only one or a few related pine family species. Prune out mistletoe as soon as it appears. For good control, remove branches at least 1 foot below the point of mistletoe attachment. Simply cutting off mistletoe from trees can reduce spread, but it won’t provide control. If it’s not possible to remove the infested trunk or a major branch, prune off the mistletoe and wrap the infested area of the tree with sturdy black polyethylene plastic secured with twine or tape to exclude light. Leave on for up to two years until the mistletoe dies, replacing plastic that becomes torn. Remove trees that are too severely infested to prune back. Although plant growth regulators temporarily remove mistletoe, these chemicals provide only short-term control and don’t kill mistletoe plants. A community effort is the best defense. Since mistletoe spreads easily from one tree to another across property lines, removing mistletoe from all trees on the street will have the greatest benefit. Some cities loan mistletoe-removal tools. Other communities pool resources to hire a tree service. ",

    "managementPestNote": "Mallow control in home gardens and landscapes is best accomplished by pulling out young plants. Because of the rapid development of the long tap root, this is best accomplished when the plant has four or fewer true leaves. The taproot gets woody as it matures and is very difficult to cut or pull out. Removing plants before they seed will help reduce the impact of the plant in coming years. Mechanical Control Mallows are best controlled mechanically by hoeing or pulling out young plants. Young mallow can also be killed by cutting them off at the crown, but older plants may resprout from the crown. If there are a large number of plants, shallow mechanical cultivation may be used when the plants are young. The cultivator should be set so that the blades or tines will pull the plants from the ground or cut the tap root below the soil level. Mowing is not an effective method of control because the plants have viable buds on the stems below the height of the mower blade. Common mallow tends to have a more prostrate growth habit so that species is even less affected by mowing. Solarization is not effective for mallow control, nor is flaming. Cultural Control Cultural control can be done by planting competitive desirable plants in areas where mallow is a problem. The shade provided by these plants will reduce germination and growth of mallow seedlings. Mulches can also be effective. At least 3 inches of organic mulch, such as bark or wood chips, will make it physically difficult for the seedling to emerge and will screen out the amount of light that mallow requires to effectively sprout. However, the mulch must be maintained to ensure that it remains at the needed depth. Otherwise, the seedling can push through the mulch and become established. Biological Control Some research has been directed towards developing a fungus, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. malvae, for control of another weedy mallow (Malva pusilla) with limited success. However, there are no commercially available biocontrols for common mallow or little mallow. Insects do feed on mallows, but there are none that are specialized for control of these weeds. Chemical Control Home Use There are no chemical controls available for home use that are effective for controlling mallows. Agricultural Use Products containing oryzalin or pendimethalin can provide partial control if applied prior to seed germination. However, due to the erratic germination pattern of these weeds, it is difficult to predict how to time herbicide applications. Landscape Use Products containing 2,4-D provide limited control when applied to young plants. Limit use of 2,4-D to turf because it will injure any broadleaf plant it contacts. Mallow is one of the few weeds that glyphosate is ineffective in controlling.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Weed management in landscaped areas is made difficult by the complexity of many plantings. Landscapes can include turfgrass, bedding plants, herbaceous perennials, shrubs, and trees. Usually more than one species is planted in the landscaped area, and there is often a mix of annual and perennial ornamentals. The great variety of ornamental species, soil types, irrigation systems, slopes, and use of mulches creates the need for a variety of weed management options. There is also public concern about the use of chemicals to control weeds and their effect on water quality, public health, and non-target species if the herbicide moves offsite through runoff, drift, or other means of exposure. The choice of specific weed management tactics depends on the weeds present and the types of turf or ornamentals planted in the area. Because of the many variables, weeds in landscape plantings are usually controlled by a combination of nonchemical and chemical methods. Use this publication as a practical review and guide to weed management options suited to planting beds and areas around trees and shrubs. Information on weed control methods that are more directed towards turfgrass can be found in Pest Notes: Weed Management in Lawns.",

    "managementPestNote": "An integrated approach using several methods is the most economical and effective means of controlling weeds. Develop a weed management plan for landscapes before planting by following these five basic steps:\tSite assessment.\tBefore soil preparation and when weeds are visible, evaluate the soil and slope of the site so problems can be corrected or future problems anticipated before planting. Site characteristics to look for include drainage, soil compaction, shading, and water infiltration rate.\tIdentify the weed species in the site, focusing on perennial weeds (see REFERENCES). The best time to look for winter annual weeds is mid- to late winter; perennials and summer annuals are easiest to identify in mid- to late summer.\tSite preparation. The most frequently overlooked aspect of a landscape maintenance program is site preparation. Control existing weeds, especially perennials, before any grading and development are started. Non-selective translocated herbicides (ones that move from the site of application to other parts of the plant) containing the active ingredient glyphosate (e.g., Roundup or glufosinate (e.g., Leopard or Finale) can be used to kill existing annual grasses and many types of perennial weeds. Non-selective contact herbicides, including synthetic active ingredients (e.g., diquat-dibromide) or organic ingredients (e.g., acetic acid and clove oil) are effective for controlling young annual plants as long as there is good spray coverage.\tSoil solarization can be used but the soil must be covered with clear plastic for 4 to 6 weeks. Solarization is most effective when done during the time of highest solar radiation—from June to August for much of California although later in some parts of the state (see REFERENCES).\tThe number of annual weeds can be reduced by irrigating the area after final grading, allowing the weeds to emerge. While the weeds are still small, remove them through shallow cultivation (less than 1 inch deep), scrape them off the soil, or spray with a postemergence non-selective herbicide, and then repeating this process of irrigation, emergence, and removal two or three times more. This will greatly reduce annual weed competition and population size.\nDefine the type of planting. Appropriate choice of plant types and landscape design can make it easier to manage weeds. For example, installing mowing strips, planter beds, and borders help to reduce weed encroachment and delineate planting types. Woody plants, especially those that are established, are more tolerant to most preemergence herbicides and close cultivation. Consequently, there are more weed control options if the planting consists entirely of woody plants, as opposed to herbaceous annuals or perennial plants, or a mixture of all three.\tChoosing drip or subsurface irrigation or microsprinklers over rotor and turf-type sprinkler heads will also help in reducing weeds, since the water is placed at or near plants. Rotor and turf-type sprinkler heads are designed to water large areas of turf such as lawns and playing fields, but in a landscaped area, there are often wider spaces between plants. In addition to wasting water, this type of irrigation will only encourage weeds to grow there.\nDon’t bring in new weeds. Weeds are sometimes introduced in the soil brought to the landscape site, either when amending the soil or in the potting mix of transplants. Specify certified amendments (US Composting Council Seal of Testing Assurance Program: compostingcouncil.org/seal-of-testing-assurance/) and check new plants for weeds, especially perennials like purple and yellow nutsedge or field bindweed. Annual weeds can be removed by hand before planting but perennial weeds in a pot or tree box will create a long term weed management problem. Weed seeds can also be brought in on equipment. Washing or blowing off mowers, trimmers, and dirty shovels and hoes will help reduce the introduction of new weeds.\nEncourage rapid establishment of desired plants. Use the best management practices to get the plants established as quickly as possible so that they become competitive with weeds and more tolerant of herbicides applied to the site. Frequent weeding and keeping weeds from producing seeds in the landscape will greatly reduce overall weed populations. Using mulch will reduce the growth of annual weeds.\nUse preemergence herbicides only if needed. Soon after planting, once the soil has settled and if mulch is not used, preemergence herbicides can be applied. These herbicides have specific label uses regarding types of plants on which they can safely be applied and how they should be used. The sites listed on the label determine where the herbicide can legally be used. Herbicides may damage new plantings if not used correctly. Any weed seedlings that have emerged between transplanting and the preemergence herbicide application must be removed by hand or gentle hoeing as these will usually not be controlled by preemergence herbicides.\nWhen developing a weed management plan for an existing planting or after an installation is in place, consider the types of landscape plants present and the weeds present and their life cycles (annual, biennial, or perennial) (Table 1). Effective weed control options in the landscape include hand-weeding and cultivation, mowing, mulching, saturated steam treatments, and chemical control. All of these methods may be used at one time or another as part of an integrated weed management program in landscape maintenance operations (Table 2). For instance, after elimination by hand-pulling, cultivation, or a postemergence herbicide application, the subsequent growth of annual weeds can be discouraged with mulches, preemergence herbicides, or both. Hot water, steam, and use of flamers is generally only effective for very small weeds and in specific types of sites such as sidewalk joints, along fence lines, and adjacent to edging materials. In small areas, it is usually more efficient to just hoe, mechanically trim, or hand remove weeds. Hand-weeding and Cultivation Cultivation (hoeing) and hand-weeding are useful to selectively remove weeds from ornamental plantings. Frequent removal of weeds when they are small and have not yet set seed will rapidly reduce the number of annual weeds over time. If weeds are scattered throughout the site, hand-weeding may be the preferred management method. Hand-weeding can be time-consuming, but should be included in all weed management programs to keep weeds from seeding. Hand-weeding must be repeated frequently until the plantings become established. Cultivation can damage ornamentals with shallow roots. When cultivating, avoid deep tilling, as this brings buried weed seeds to the soil surface where they are more likely to germinate. Perennial weeds are often spread by cultivation and should be controlled or removed by other methods.\tKey to identifying weeds Weed Photo Gallery\tTABLE 1.

How to Manage Weeds in Five Types of Landscape Plantings.\nType of planting and comments\tRecommendations\nWoody Trees and Shrub Beds. Dense plantings reduce weeds. Preplant weed control is not as critical as in other types of plantings. It is often necessary to combine treatments for complete weed control.\nControl perennial weeds before planting (although control may be possible after planting).\tUse geotextile fabrics with a shallow layer of mulch or use a thick layer of mulch without a geotextile base.\tUse a preemergence herbicide, if needed, and supplement with spot applications of postemergence herbicides and/or hand-weeding.\tRemove perennial weeds by hand, spot applications of glyphosate or glufosinate, or grass-selective herbicide such as fluazifop.\nWoody Ground Cover Beds. Woody mature ground covers should exclude most weeds; however, weed encroachment during establishment is likely.\nControl perennial weeds before planting, although perennial grasses may be selectively controlled after planting with fluazifop (Fusilade, 1 Ornamec 1), clethodim (Envoy 1), sethoxydim (Grass-Getter), or other selective grass herbicides.\tControl annual weeds with mulch. A preemergence herbicide can be added but rooting of stolons in new plantings may be affected; supplement with some hand-weeding.\tUse geotextiles where possible but do not use them where ground covers are expected to root and spread.\nAnnual Flower Beds. A dense planting will help shade out many weeds. Periodic cultivations (at 3- to 4-week intervals and between display rotations) will suppress many weeds.\nControl perennial weeds before planting and carefully select flower species for weed management compatibility.\tControl annual weeds with mulches, preemergence herbicides, frequent cultivation, and/or hand-weeding.\tSelectively control perennial grasses with clethodim or fluazifop, or other grass-selective herbicides.\tAvoid nonselective herbicides after planting.\nHerbaceous Perennial Beds. Weed management options in herbaceous perennial beds are similar to those for annual flowers, except (1) it is more important to eradicate perennial weeds as there will be no opportunity to cultivate or renovate the bed for several years; and (2) fewer species are included on herbicide labels.\nControl perennial weeds before planting.\tUse geotextiles where possible.\tUse mulches, supplement with hand-weeding and preemergence herbicide after weeding if needed.\nMixed Plantings of Woody and Herbaceous Plants. Weed management is complex because of the diversity of species. Different areas of the bed could receive different treatments. Site preparation is critical because post-plant herbicide choices are few.\nPlant the woody species first.\tControl perennial weeds in the first two growing seasons, then introduce the herbaceous species.\tPlant close together to shade the soil.\tGroup plants within the bed that will receive similar weed management programs.\nHerbicides should not normally be needed by home gardeners. Mulching, removal by hand, and proper irrigation (pattern and amount of water) are sufficient in most cases. 1 For use only by professional applicators. Flaming and Heating Young weeds in open areas also can be controlled with small flaming or infrared units. Propane burners are available that can be used to rapidly pass the heating element or flame over young weeds to kill them. Do not burn the weed to the ground; usually 2 to 5 seconds of exposure is enough to kill plant cells. Check the plants 1 day after the heat treatment and if the plants still look healthy, reapply heat for a slightly longer time or choose another technique. Flaming and heating are more effective on broadleaf weeds than grasses. Be careful not to flame dried out vegetation, dry wood chips, and other flammable materials, or near buildings. Don’t get the flame near desired plants. Hot Water or Steam Treatments. Hot water or steam generation can also be used in a similar fashion. The advantage is less chance of fire, but these units need considerable water and fuel. A home gardener can apply hot water (greater than 200°F) and achieve a limited amount of weed suppression. This method is often not very effective because the water temperature rapidly drops once it is removed from the heat source. There are machines currently available that use superheated hot water or steam to kill weeds. Professional-level equipment is expensive to purchase and maintain, so these machines are not appropriate for the home user. However, commercial landscapers may find them useful in certain situations where the use of herbicides is not desired, such as when line-marking playing fields, in playgrounds, around woody plants, for edging, for weeds growing in cracks in parking lots, and for weeds growing along fence lines. Because these methods employ boiling water or steam, workers must be adequately trained in the use of the machines to prevent severe burns. These machines are most effective on very young annual weeds, especially broadleaf weeds, or perennials that have recently emerged from seeds. The effect is similar to that of a nonselective, postemergence herbicide. Hot water and steam are not very effective on perennial weeds with established storage organs, such as rhizomes and bulbs, nor do they control woody plants. Mowing and Trimming Mowing can be used to prevent the formation and spread of seeds from many broadleaf weeds from turf into the landscape areas by cutting off flower heads. However, weeds that flower lower than the mowing blade (such as spotted spurge or common woodsorrel) are not controlled. Repeated mowing tends to favor the establishment of grasses and low-growing perennial weeds. Mowing of some ground covers can rejuvenate them and make them more competitive against weeds. String and Blade Trimmers. The top growth of older weeds can be controlled by using a string or blade trimmer. Annual broadleaf weeds are more effectively controlled than annual grasses because the growing points of grasses are usually below ground. Most perennial weeds are not controlled using trimmers, but trimming will make them less noticeable in areas if you are limited in other methods for control. Prevent repeated damage to trunks of established woody perennials from the string trimmer by placing a temporary shield around the trunk. One way to create a shield is to place a segment of irrigation or drain pipe that is several inches in diameter and split lengthwise around the base of the trunk. Mulches A mulch is any material placed on the soil to cover and protect it. Mulches suppress annual weeds by limiting light required for weed establishment. Many types of landscape mulches are available. The most common are bark and other wood products and black plastic or landscape fabric materials. Other products that are used include paper, yard compost, hulls from nuts (such as almonds) or cereals (rice), municipal composts, and stones. Organic Mulches.\tOrganic mulches include wood chips, sawdust, yard waste (leaves, clippings, and wood products), and hardwood or softwood bark chips or nuggets. Bark chips are moderate-sized particles (1/4 to 1/2 inch) and have moderate to good ability to withstand decomposition, while bark nuggets are larger in size (1/2 to 1 1/2 inches) and have excellent stability over time. All of these can be used in landscape beds planted with herbaceous or woody ornamentals. Larger mulch pieces (greater than 1 1/2 inches) do not provide good weed control unless applied very thickly (often 6 inches or deeper) because the space between the pieces allows light to penetrate and weeds to grow through. The thickness or depth of mulch necessary to adequately suppress weed growth depends on the mulch type, the weed pressure, and whether an herbicide or an underlayment (e.g., fabric, plastic) mulch is to be used with it. The thickness or depth of mulch necessary to adequately suppress weed growth depends on the mulch type, the weed pressure, and whether an herbicide or an underlayment (e.g. fabric, plastic) mulch is to be used with it. The larger the particle size of the organic mulch, the greater the depth required to exclude all light from the soil surface. Coarse-textured mulches can be applied up to 4 inches deep and provide long-term weed control. Fine-textured mulches pack more tightly and should only be applied to a depth of about 2 inches. If the mulch is too decomposed, it becomes a means of weed propagation rather than a means of prevention. Plan to periodically replenish organic mulches, regardless of particle size, because of decomposition, movement, or settling. If seedlings germinate in mulches, a light raking, hoeing, or hand-weeding will remove the young weeds. Bark mulches for ornamentals containing pre-applied herbicides are available for residential use. These should not be used on landscapes with food-producing plants. As with any pesticide, these products must be used with care to make sure the desired plants are not injured. Additionally, protective gloves must be worn when applying them. Inorganic Mulches. Including both natural and synthetic products, these mulches are generally more expensive and less widely used in the landscape. Natural inorganic mulches are stable over time and include materials such as sand, gravel, or pebbles. If using rock mulch, consider placing a landscape fabric underneath it. The fabric creates a layer between the mulch and soil, preventing rock pieces from sinking into the soil. It also prevents soil from moving above the rock layer, which would bring weed seed to the surface or create a suitable place for windborne seeds to grow. Black plastic (solid polyethylene) can be used underneath mulches to improve weed control. It provides excellent control of annual weeds and suppresses perennial weeds, but it lacks porosity and restricts air and water movement. It also tends to tear and break apart rather quickly. For this reason, black plastic is not the preferred long-term weed control method in landscape beds. Synthetic Mulches. Manufactured materials, called geotextiles or landscape fabrics, have been developed to replace black plastic in the landscape. Geotextiles are porous and allow water and air to pass through them, overcoming the major disadvantage of black plastic. Although these materials are relatively expensive and time-consuming to install, they become cost-effective if the planting is to remain in place for 4 or more years. Geotextiles are used mainly for long-term weed control around woody ornamental tree and shrub plantings. Geotextiles should not be used where the area is to be replanted periodically, such as in annual flower beds or in areas where the fabric would inhibit the rooting and spread of ground covers. Tree and shrub roots can penetrate the materials and if the material is removed, damage can occur to the plant’s root system. This might be a concern if a fabric has been in place longer than 5 years. One geotextile fabric (BioBarrier) has an herbicide encapsulated in nodules on the fabric that reduces root penetration problems. Placing a landscape fabric under mulch results in greater weed control than mulch used alone. There are differences in weed-controlling ability among the geotextiles: fabrics that are thin, lightweight, or have an open mesh allow for greater weed penetration than more closely woven or nonwoven (spunbonded) fabrics. To install a landscape fabric, plant first and then install the fabric afterwards using long U-shaped staples to peg it down. After laying the cloth close to the ground, cut an “X” over the plant and pull it through the cloth). If laying down a fabric before planting, cut an “X” through the fabric and dig a planting hole. Avoid leaving soil from the planting hole on top of the fabric because this could put weed seeds above the material. Fold the “X” back down to keep the geotextile fabric as continuous as possible. Weeds will grow through any gap in the landscape fabric, so it is important to overlap pieces of fabric and tack them down tightly. Apply a shallow mulch layer (about 1 inch deep) to thoroughly cover the fabric and prevent UV light from breaking it down (photodegradation). If weeds grow into or through the geotextile, remove them when they are small to prevent them from creating holes in the fabric. Maintain a weed-free mulch layer on top of the fabric by hand-weeding or by applying herbicides. Special consideration should be given to the fact that yellow nutsedge can grow through most geotextiles. Thicker fabrics are better at suppressing yellow nutsedge than thinner types. For more information, see Pest Notes: Nutsedge listed in REFERENCES. Problems with Mulches. There are several problems associated with the use of organic and inorganic mulches. Perennial weeds such as field bindweed and nutsedges often have sufficient root reserves to enable them to penetrate even thick layers of mulches. When mulches are too finely textured, applied too thickly, or begin to decompose, they stay wet between irrigations or rain events and allow annual weeds to germinate and grow directly within the mulch. For best weed control, use a coarse-textured mulch, with pieces of about 1/4 to 3/4 inch in size, with a low water-holding capacity. Weeds that are particular problems are those that have windborne seeds, such as common groundsel, prickly lettuce, and common sowthistle, or those with a taproot such as spotted spurge.\tTABLE 3.

Disease incidence, such as root or stem rot, may increase when such thick mulches are maintained. While the use of organic mulches may provide very effective weed control, it can be improved upon by applying a preemergence herbicide at the same time as the mulch (see Table 3). Supplemental hand-weeding or spot spraying may also be needed. Avoid mulches with a pH less than 4 or that have an “off odor” such as an ammonia, vinegar, or rotten-egg smell. These mulches were stored incorrectly and contain chemical compounds that may injure plants, especially herbaceous plants. If using a composted mulch, temperatures achieved during the composting process should have killed most weed seeds. However, if the compost was stored while uncovered, weed seeds may have been blown onto the mulch. Be sure the mulch is not contaminated with weed seeds or other propagules such as nutsedge tubers. In addition to the precautions noted above about rock mulches, removal of weeds in rock mulches by hand weeding or hoeing is very difficult. White-colored rocks are very reflective, and this increased light can damage sensitive plants. Dark-colored rocks will retain heat and may also cause plant stress. Herbicides for Landscape Plantings Herbicides have been effectively used in many types of landscape plantings and are most often integrated with the cultural practices discussed above. Generally, home gardeners should not need to apply herbicides to existing landscapes. Hand-weeding and mulching should provide sufficient control and avoid the hazards to desirable plants associated with herbicide use. Many of the herbicide active ingredients and trade names listed here are for use by professional landscape pest managers and are not available to home gardeners. There are some home-use products that contain the same active ingredients, but the trade name is different. To determine which herbicide active ingredient(s) are in a product, read the information on the label. Preemergence Herbicides. After annual weeds have been removed from an area or before they emerge, preemergence herbicides can be applied to prevent the germination or survival of weed seedlings. Preemergence herbicides must be applied before the weed seedlings emerge. Match herbicides with weed species present and consider using herbicide combinations. The activity of specific herbicides toward specific weed species varies. Also, the length of control varies amongst herbicide active ingredients, rates of application, and other factors. Examples of preemergence herbicide active ingredients and trade names include: DCPA (Dacthal), dithiopyr (Dimension), isoxaben (Gallery), napropamide (Devrinol), oryzalin (Surflan, Weed Impede), oxadiazon (Ronstar), pendimethalin (Pendulum, Pre-M), prodiamine (Barricade), trifluralin (Preen), flumioxazin (Broadstar), and indaziflam (Marengo). Most of these will control annual grasses and many annual broadleaf weeds and can be used safely around many woody and herbaceous ornamentals. Isoxaben is used for control of annual broadleaf weeds only. Timing. Timing of a preemergence herbicide application is determined by when the target weeds are expected to germinate, or by when the weed is in the stage that is most sensitive to the herbicide. In general, late summer to early fall applications of preemergence herbicides are used to control winter annuals, while late winter to early spring applications are used to control summer annuals and seedlings of perennial weeds. If the herbicide is not moved into soil due to lack of irrigation or insufficient rainfall or if a short residual (short acting) product was applied, more than one herbicide application may be needed. Generally, herbicides degrade faster under wet, warm conditions than under dry, cool conditions. Some herbicides are degraded by sunlight, so incorporation via irrigation, rain, or cultivation may be necessary. Also, some preemergence herbicides need to be applied at a higher rate if the soil is high in organic matter due to binding with the organic matter. Check the herbicide label for recommendations about what rate to use depending on your soil type. Herbicide and Mulch Placement. The placement of a preemergence herbicide in relation to an organic mulch can affect the herbicide’s performance. Additionally, the characteristics of organic mulches can affect how herbicides work. Mulch that is made up of coarse particles will have little effect on herbicide activity. A mulch that primarily consists of fine particles can reduce the availability of some herbicides. The finer the organic material (compost or manure, compared to bark), the greater the binding of the herbicide. Many preemergence herbicides are tightly bound by organic matter, and while the binding minimizes leaching, it can also minimize an herbicide’s activity. Another important factor is the depth of the mulch. An herbicide applied on top of a thin mulch may be able to leach through to where the weed seeds are germinating, but when applied to the top of a thick layer of mulch it may not get down to the zone of weed seed germination. Suggestions for use of mulch with herbicides are given in Table 3 . Postemergence Herbicides. When weeds are not controlled by preemergence herbicides or geotextile fabrics and are difficult to control using mechanical or physical methods, postemergence herbicides may be required. Most postmergence herbicides control existing plants only and do not give residual weed control. Their primary function is to control young annual species, but some are also used to control perennial species. Some herbicides are “systemic” or “translocated,” meaning they move throughout rapidly-growing plants. Common systemic herbicides include the herbicides with the active ingredients clethodim or fluazifop which selectively control most annual and perennial grasses, 2,4-D which selectively controls many annual and perennial broadleaf plants, and glyphosate (Roundup Pro and others) which is nonselective and effective on most annual and perennial weeds. Glufosinate (Finale or Leopard), diquat (Reward), pelargonic acid (Scythe), and herbicides containing plant oils such as clove and cinnamon (Bonide Burnout) or limonene (Avenger), or those using fatty acids (FinalSan) or acetic acid (Weed Pharm) are nonselective, contact herbicides that kill or injure any vegetation they contact. They kill small annual weeds, but only “burn off” the exposed parts of perennial weeds. They are most effective on small broadleaf weeds. When using contact herbicides, especially on larger plants, it is important to have excellent spray coverage. Weed control can often be improved by adding a surfactant to the spray mix. The herbicide’s label usually provides guidance on which type of surfactant to use. Avoid Herbicide Injury. Because of the close proximity of many different species of plants in the landscape, herbicide injury to desired plants may occur, resulting in visual plant damage. Herbicide injury symptoms vary according to plant species and the herbicide and can include the following:\tyellowing (chlorosis)\twhitening or bleaching\troot stunting\tdistorted growth\tdeath of leaves\tThere are many other causes of similar plant injury; including nutrient deficiencies, fertilizer or salt burn, plant diseases, insect pests, and severe weather conditions.\tHerbicide injury usually occurs when an herbicide is applied to a site or plant where it is not labeled or at a rate or frequency greater than written on the label. Herbicide movement from an adjacent site via air or water can occur, so applicators should avoid harming nearby plants by using some of the techniques below. Granular formulations of preemergence herbicides are less likely to cause injury than sprayable formulations. Using a granular formulation reduces the potential for damage by foliar uptake, but granules of some herbicides can still injure plants if they collect in the base of leaves or adhere to wet leaves. Apply nonselective liquid herbicides with low pressure and large droplets on a calm day. Use shielded sprayers when making applications around ornamentals to avoid contact with nontarget plants. Herbicide injury to established plants from soil-applied chemicals is often temporary but can cause serious growth inhibition to newly planted ornamentals. Injury may result when persistent herbicides are applied to surrounding areas for weed control in turf or complete vegetative control under pavement. Activated charcoal incorporated into the soil may adsorb the herbicide and minimize injury. Usually it just takes time for herbicide residues to completely degrade. To speed degradation, supplement the organic content of the soil and keep it moist but not soggy during periods of warm weather.",

    "managementPestNote": "Prepare Your Site A healthy lawn begins with a properly prepared site. Before planting, remove existing vegetation and prepare the area for planting. If you expect annual weeds to be a problem, irrigate the site to allow weeds to germinate. Follow up with a shallow cultivation or an application of a nonselective herbicide (defined below) such as glyphosate or clove oil, and repeat this process until the area is free of weeds. This is important when planting with seed or sod. Perennial weeds are harder to control than annuals. For perennials, dig out and remove as many as possible. Cultivate the soil to bring up buried propagules (stems, rhizomes, and tubers). It is best to do this when conditions are warm and dry so that the propagules will desiccate on the soil surface. Rake off and remove the propagules. If you have particularly troublesome weed problems, continue to work the soil without irrigating for several months to bring up new propagules. A few species such as field bindweed and purple nutsedge cannot be controlled in this manner. A nonselective, systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, applied when weeds are actively growing, can also be used to kill many difficult-to-control perennials, but repeat applications may be needed. Soil solarization can be very effective at controlling many weed species prior to planting and is ideal for gardeners who want to avoid herbicide use. Once the area is rototilled, amended, and prepared for planting, place clear polyethylene plastic 1 to 2 mils (0.025-0.050 mm) thick over the moist soil surface, and cover the edges with soil to hold them in place. For best results, soil solarization must be carried out during the time of highest solar radiation—from June to August in inland California—and the tarps must remain on the infested soil for 4 to 6 weeks. Solarization is less effective or ineffective in cooler coastal areas or in the shade. Many annual weeds can be controlled with this method; however, soil solarization is not as effective at controlling certain perennials such as field bindweed and nutsedge. Refer to Pest Notes: Soil Solarization for more information. Many soils need to be amended with organic matter or nutrients. Amendments can improve drainage in clay soils or improve the water-holding capacity in sandy soils. The ability of soils to drain water and simultaneously hold enough water is extremely important in establishing the turfgrass root system and maintaining healthy lawns. Lawns thrive in soils with good drainage that allow the unrestricted flow of oxygen, nutrients, and water. When adding topsoil, make sure it is from a reputable source and that it is free of rocks, weed propagules such as rhizomes or tubers, and herbicide residues.\tTable 1.

They are divided into two broad categories: cool-season and warm-season grasses, which reflect their temperature preference and periods of active growth. Cool-season species such as tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and Kentucky bluegrass thrive at 60-80°F and may become stressed or go into a semi-dormant state in periods of extreme cold or hot temperatures. They do best in northern and coastal California climates, although there are cool-season grasses grown throughout California. Warm-season grasses such as bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass grow best in southern California or Central Valley climates where summers are hot and dry and winters are relatively mild. These grasses go dormant during winter months when soil temperatures drop below 52°F and then green up in spring when soil temperatures rise. In general, cool-season grasses are less drought-tolerant and require 25% more water than warm-season grasses grown in the same location. When planting a lawn, choose a species that best fits your specific conditions. Poorly adapted species are more susceptible to weed invasions and require more intense maintenance than well-adapted species. For more information refer to the publication Turfgrass Selection for the Home Landscape\t(PDF), listed in REFERENCES. It is essential to choose a planting time that allows the turfgrass species to establish quickly and be competitive with weeds. Warm-season grasses should be planted from mid-spring to midsummer. Cool-season grasses should be planted in early spring or fall. Lawns will compete with weeds more effectively if established quickly. Lawns established from sod have few weed problems from the moment they are planted. Lawns planted from seed, stolons, or plugs can take up to 2 months to become established and are, therefore, more susceptible to weed invasions. Even if a planting site has been carefully prepared, some weeds will probably develop in a new lawn. Remove weeds by hand as they appear. This will prevent them from producing seed and extending the invasion. Properly timed irrigation, mowing, and fertilization can keep weeds under control. In the first few weeks after planting turfgrass roots are fairly short, extending only into the top few inches of soil. Water lightly to keep the root zone moist without saturating the soil. Once the turfgrass becomes established, encourage healthy root growth to deeper depths with deep, infrequent watering. Mow new lawns for the first time when their roots are firmly planted in the soil. Be sure the soil is fairly dry so that the young turfgrass is not torn from the ground. Irrigation Many lawns are watered incorrectly. Poor irrigation practices can weaken turfgrass, allowing weeds to invade. Annual bluegrass, crabgrass, dallisgrass, and nutsedge are just a few weed species that thrive in poorly irrigated lawns. To maintain a healthy lawn, uniform water coverage is needed. Sprinkler heads that are broken, obstructed, or set too low or too high may not reach all areas of the lawn and can result in dry or dead spots in an otherwise healthy turfgrass. In general, deep, infrequent irrigation will encourage healthy root growth. Light, frequent watering is only required when the turfgrass has just been planted and the root system is developing. Watering established turfgrass lightly and frequently creates a shallow-rooted lawn, making it less durable and allowing shallow-rooted weeds such as crabgrass to get the competitive edge. Ideally, turfgrass should be irrigated deeply enough to penetrate the soil to a depth of 6 to 8 inches. Allow the soil to partially dry out between waterings. The top 1 to 2 inches of soil should be fairly dry before water is applied again. Water requirements vary among turfgrass species and also vary depending on climate, time of year, and growing conditions. As a general rule, warm-season grasses only need to be watered once or twice a week. Cool-season grasses require more frequent watering, up to three times a week in hot weather. Turfgrass species growing in shade require less water than the same species growing in full sun. Turfgrass growing on clay soils does not need to be watered as frequently as turfgrass growing on sandy soils, because clay soils retain water longer than sandy soils, and sandy soils drain water and dry out quickly. Low application rates and/or division of total irrigation time into 2 or more applications per day are sometimes needed on clay soils to allow water infiltration and prevent puddling and runoff. For specific irrigation requirements for warm- and cool-season turfgrasses in various regions of California and at different sprinkler outputs, see the UC Guide to Healthy Lawns and the Lawn Watering Guide for California . Additional resources are Managing Lawns in Shade, Managing Lawns on Heavy Soils, and Managing Turfgrasses During Drought . Mowing Each turfgrass species has specific mowing-height requirements (see Mowing Your Lawn and Grasscycling —PDF). Mowing some grasses too short can weaken the turfgrass and increase weed invasions. Alternatively, if some grasses are not mowed short enough, the thatch layer can build up, reducing water penetration and weakening the turfgrass. Mow grasses more frequently when they are actively growing. A standard guide is to remove no more than 1/3 of the leaf blade at each mowing. If too much is removed at one time, it can take some time for the grass to recover, giving weeds a chance to invade. Lawns with weed invasions often appear uneven. Mow weedy lawns frequently enough to avoid this patchy appearance and prevent flower and weed seed formation. Be sure that mower blades are sharp enough so that the turfgrass is not damaged. For large areas, it is best to mow the least weedy section first and the weediest section last to avoid spreading weeds. Washing the mower's deck and underside afterwards will remove weed seeds. The same applies if mowers are moved from weedy lawns to other lawns, to avoid transporting weed seeds and propagules. Avoid mowing lawns when the soil is wet, such as after rain or irrigation; moving a mower over wet soil can lead to compaction. Fertilizing To maintain a healthy lawn, follow fertilizing guidelines carefully. Begin a regular fertilization program approximately 6 weeks after planting. In general, lawns need to be fertilized about four times a year while they are actively growing, with no more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per application. See Practical Lawn Fertilization\t(PDF) for requirements for specific turfgrass species. Thatch Regular thatch removal will help keep your turfgrass healthy and competitive with weeds. Thatch is a layer of organic matter (stems, stolons, roots) that develops between the turfgrass blades and the soil surface. A thin layer of thatch is normal and even beneficial; it can help limit weed germination. Some turfgrass species, particularly warm-season creeping grasses, develop thick thatch layers that can prevent the circulation of air, water, and nutrients in the soil. Generally, you should dethatch your lawn when the thatch layer is more than 1/2 inch thick. For some species, such as zoysiagrass, bermudagrass, or Kentucky bluegrass, this may mean dethatching every year. For other species, such as tall fescue, dethatching may only be needed every 5 years or not at all. Use a thatching rake on small lawns to loosen the layer of thatch. On creeping-type grass lawns, such as bermudagrass, use a verticutter or dethatcher to cut through the lawn to the soil surface. Aeration Heavy traffic can compact soil over time. Soil compaction restricts the flow of oxygen, water, and nutrients into the roots, causing the turfgrass to grow slowly and making it more susceptible to weed invasions. Alleviate soil compaction with regular aeration. Lawns on heavy clay soils or lawns with heavy foot or equipment traffic may need to be aerated several times a year while lawns with little activity may only need to be aerated once a year or less. Aerators, sometimes called aerifiers, remove small cores of soil or create pores or channels in the rooting zone. A hand-held aerifier may be adequate on small lawns. For larger areas, machine-driven aerifiers are more practical and can be found at equipment rental businesses. Aerate when the turfgrass is actively growing. Be aware that aeration will leave temporary holes in the turf that will gradually fill in within a few weeks; however some weed seeds may germinate in the spaces during that time. Soil cores are usually left on the lawn surface and quickly break down with irrigation; however some soil cores may contain weed seeds. In lawns that are known to be weedy, a preemergence herbicide application should be considered following aeration. Hand weeding Controlling occasional weeds by hand pulling may be all that is necessary if you practice regular and proper maintenance procedures. Hand weeding is particularly important for preventing infestations of creeping woodsorrel (oxalis), nutsedge, dandelion, spurge, dallisgrass, and bermudagrass. Remove weeds while they are still young and before they set seed or produce rhizomes or tubers. Remove small patches before they get large. Making this a regular habit will greatly reduce the number of weeds in your lawn. Be sure to remove the entire weed, including the root. A dandelion fork or fishtail weeder is useful for removing weeds with a thick taproot. Larger patches can be dug out and the holes filled with clean soil. Herbicides If your lawn is properly maintained, herbicides will generally not be necessary. When they are needed, use them as part of an integrated management program that includes good cultural maintenance practices. No single herbicide will control all lawn weeds, and not all herbicides can be used on all lawn species. You must identify your weed problem(s) and turfgrass species before choosing an herbicide. A few of the most serious lawn weeds, such as some perennial grasses, cannot be effectively controlled with herbicides without killing the turfgrass as well. The products mentioned here are primarily for residential lawns. Professional turf managers who are licensed pesticide applicators should also review the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines for Turf . Herbicides are classified in several ways:\tpreemergent or postemergent\tcontact or systemic\tselective or nonselective.\tPreemergence herbicides are applied before weeds emerge from the soil; they kill weed seedlings as they germinate and try to emerge. In lawns they are primarily used against annual grass weeds such as annual bluegrass and crabgrass, but there are also preemergence herbicides that are effective against many broadleaf weeds. Postemergence herbicides are applied after weeds have emerged from the soil; they control actively growing weeds. Postemergence herbicides may have either contact or systemic activity. Contact herbicides cause localized injury where the chemical comes in contact with the plant and are most successful when applied to young weeds. Examples include diquat, carfentrazone, plant oils and herbicidal soaps. In contrast, systemic herbicides move within the plant, causing injury at additional sites in the plant and can control older weeds. Examples include glyphosate, quinclorac, triclopyr, or 2,4-D, dicamba, and mecoprop mixtures (active ingredients in many broadleaf weed killers). Selective herbicides kill target weeds without damaging desirable turfgrass species. They are toxic to only certain plants or weeds. For example, 2,4-D selectively kills only broadleaf plants and not grasses; fluazifop selectively kills only grasses and not broadleaf plants. Nonselective herbicides kill all or most vegetation including turfgrass. They should only be used prior to planting a lawn, during renovation, or as spot treatments. Examples of nonselective postemergence herbicides include diquat (a contact herbicide), plant oils (contact herbicides), and glyphosate (a systemic herbicide). The herbicide you choose will depend on the types of weeds you are trying to control and the tolerance of your turfgrass species. Table 2 lists some common herbicides and brand names labeled for use on residential turfgrass lawns or for turfgrass renovation and highlights the types of weeds or special weed problems they control. Please note that some of the pesticides mentioned here are available for professional use only, but can be applied on residential lawns .\tTable 2.

Pest Notes on individual weeds outline specific herbicides that effectively control them. For more details on herbicide products available to professionals, see UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Turfgrass—Weeds .\nHerbicides for Broadleaf Weeds The easiest weeds to control in grass lawns are annual broadleaves. Many products are available and formulated for specific weeds or for use on specific turfgrass species. Generally these weed killers are postemergence systemic herbicides containing combinations of two or three active ingredients, such as dicamba, mecoprop, or 2,4-D, and are very effective in controlling numerous broadleaf weeds without damage to grass lawns. Triclopyr is also an effective broadleaf herbicide but will cause injury to bermudagrass lawns and other stoloniferous turfgrass; it is safe to use on most cool-season turfgrasses such as bluegrass, ryegrass, and tall fescue lawns. Newer herbicides carfentrazone and quinclorac also have broadleaf weed activity and are often formulated with the other broadleaf herbicides to increase the speed or spectrum of weed control. Broadleaf herbicides and their combinations are also effective against perennial broadleaves, although more than one application may be necessary. Be aware that many postemergence broadleaf herbicides are prone to drift in the air and may contact desirable plants, especially when applications are made in windy conditions. Also be aware that certain postemergence broadleaf herbicides, such as dicamba and triclopyr, can be absorbed by tree roots growing in lawns and may cause tree injury if applied too close to the tree drip line. Always consult the herbicide label for specific application details and precautions. Herbicides for Grass Weeds Annual grasses such as crabgrass, foxtail, and annual bluegrass can be effectively controlled in established lawns with common preemergence herbicides such as benefin, bensulide, dithiopyr, oryzalin, pendimethalin, and prodiamine. Dimethenamid-p, ethofumesate, and indaziflam are preemergence herbicides used to control a narrower range of weeds in specific turfgrass species. The key to success for all preemergence herbicides is to apply the herbicide 2 to 3 weeks prior to weed germination. Preemergence herbicides work best when the soil is moist but the turf is dry at the time of application, and when thoroughly watered into the lawn as soon as possible after application. It may take three applications per year (early fall, late winter and mid-spring) to clean up a heavy weed infestation, but herbicides should not be needed year after year, if cultural practices are modified to favor the turfgrass. Be aware that overseeding or reseeding lawns may not be possible for several weeks or months after applying a preemergence herbicide. It is much more difficult to control weedy grasses growing in established lawns with postemergence herbicides. Products containing quinclorac are available to homeowners and reduce crabgrass, foxtails, and barnyardgrass infestations but not as effectively as preemergence herbicides, and several applications are needed in summer and in subsequent years. Professional applicators may use ethofumesate (a preemergence herbicide with some postemergence activity), foramsulfuron, and sulfosulfuron to selectively remove grass weeds from turfgrass lawns, but applications are rare in residential lawns and more common in highly managed golf courses and commercial turfgrass. Some perennial grasses, such as bermudagrass, dallisgrass, or knotgrass growing in a tall fescue lawn, are extremely difficult to control. Frequently a nonselective systemic herbicide such as glyphosate, or the grass-selective systemic herbicide fluazifop are needed. Make spot treatments because these herbicides will kill turfgrass as well. They must be applied when weeds are actively growing and are most successful when applied in early fall before the weedy grass goes into dormancy. Bermudagrass growing in a tall fescue lawn can also be suppressed with repeated applications of triclopyr, fenoxaprop, or fluazifop. See the product labels for specific directions. Herbicides for Broadleaf and Grass Weeds Some preemergence herbicides for use in lawns will effectively control specific weeds (both grasses and broadleaves) as indicated on their label. It is very important to identify the weeds to be controlled and understand the time of year they most often germinate. When applying preemergence herbicides, apply them after any aerating and/or dethatching; otherwise, the herbicides will be removed from the soil with the cores or the thatch and the herbicide activity will be decreased. Herbicides for Sedges Sedges, such as yellow and purple nutsedge and green kyllinga, can be killed with spot treatments of a nonselective systemic postemergence herbicide such as glyphosate. Alternatively, two applications of the selective postemergence herbicides halosulfuron, sulfentrazone, or sulfosulfuron effectively remove sedges from lawns. Green kyllinga seed is highly viable and contributes to the spread of this sedge. Most preemergence herbicides effectively prevent kyllinga seedling emergence. Yellow and purple nutsedge are spread primarily by tubers. No preemergence herbicides kill nutsedge tubers in cool-season turfgrass. In warm-season lawns, dimethenamid-p has activity on nutsedges and green kyllinga, and metolachlor is registered for control of yellow nutsedge (and its tubers). Both of these products are for professional use only. Herbicides for Newly Seeded Lawns Special care should be taken when applying herbicides on newly seeded lawns because of the sensitivity of seedling plants. Among the preemergence herbicides, only mesotrione and siduron can be used on newly seeded or established cool-season turfgrass for control of broadleaf seedlings and warm-season grass weeds such as crabgrass, foxtails, and barnyardgrass. Mesotrione is combined with a starter fertilizer to be used at planting and is available to home gardeners. Siduron should not be used on warm-season turfgrass species and can only be used by a professional applicator. Postemergence herbicides selective for broadleaf weeds can be used once the turfgrass has produced several tillers and has been mowed two or three times. Weed and Feed Products Some fertilizer products contain either preemergence or postemergence herbicides (or both) for weed control (usually crabgrass prevention or broadleaf weed control). Use these combination products only when the lawn has a known weed problem and not every time you fertilize. Herbicides should only be applied when you have observed high numbers of weeds and are sure treatment is necessary. With preemergence products, this means relying upon weed populations observed last season. Be sure the active ingredient in the product is one that will control the weed species causing your problems and also that the timing of the application is right. There is no point in applying preemergence herbicides after the majority of target weeds have emerged. Other Weed Control Products Corn gluten meal is a fine yellow powder that is a waste product left over from the processing of corn and is often marketed for weed control. It has high nitrogen content and can be top-dressed onto established turfgrass. Research conducted in the midwest suggests that repeated applications of corn gluten meal may prevent the emergence of some weeds, but the research results are not consistent. In experiments conducted on California lawns, corn gluten meal did not provide satisfactory weed control. However, corn gluten meal may help in weed management because its high nitrogen content acts as a fertilizer, which makes the turfgrass more competitive with weeds. Additionally it may act as a mulch to suppress weed germination. It is the combination of these factors that make corn gluten meal successful in a dense turf with a low density of annual weeds. Corn gluten meal has no effect on already emerged weeds. Herbicide Success Tips Lawn and garden companies market their own brand names of herbicides. These trade names are so numerous and change so often that they cannot all be listed in this publication. Shop for herbicides by looking for the common name or active ingredient that appears on the label in small print under the title \"Ingredients.\" Unlike brand names, common names for active ingredients do not change from company to company. Different products will vary in the percentages of active ingredients they contain. Some products are formulated as ready-to-use to allow for the convenience of no mixing, others as granules, and many others as higher-concentration liquid sprays that require mixing with water. Follow all label directions carefully and only apply herbicides at the time of year and at the rates recommended. Be sure the herbicide is effective against the weed you are trying to control and that it is recommended for your type of lawn. Improper use could injure or kill desirable turfgrass or other plants in the landscape. Remember that many broadleaf weed herbicides are prone to drift or can be injurious to shallow tree roots growing in the lawn, so exercise proper caution. Do not apply herbicides under hot, dry, or windy conditions as they could injure turfgrass or nearby ornamentals. If you are applying preemergence herbicides, remember that you cannot reseed desirable turfgrass species for several weeks or months after application. If you are applying preemergence herbicides, apply them after any aerating or dethatching; otherwise, the herbicides will be removed from the soil with the cores or thatch and the uniform herbicide barrier on the soil surface will be disturbed. RENOVATING LAWNS Before renovating your lawn, identify the reasons why the lawn became weedy. Were you growing the right turfgrass species for your area? Did you follow recommended irrigation, fertilization, and mowing practices? Did you have good drainage? Before you replant, correct the problems that allowed weeds to invade your lawn previously. Use good management practices on your lawn to reduce new weed invasions. If weeds have completely taken over a small area of your lawn, you may want to consider a partial renovation. Dig out the affected area, remove and destroy weeds, and work the soil with a garden rake to break up clods and remove weed debris. Add soil amendments and starter fertilizer and then level and firm the site. Irrigate and patch the soil with sod, seed, stolons, or plugs and irrigate again. If your lawn is primarily weeds, a complete renovation may be necessary. The first step in a complete renovation is to kill and remove the existing turfgrass and weeds. There are a few ways to remove a lawn. For instance, you can dig out the turfgrass and weeds, prepare the site for planting, and then solarize the soil. Alternatively, you can rototill the old lawn and rake up the old turfgrass and weeds. You will need to repeat the tilling and raking until all of the debris is gone. Another method is to apply a nonselective herbicide such as glyphosate to kill the existing lawn and weeds, remove all the plant material you can, and work the soil until debris is gone. Once the old lawn is removed, prepare the site (as discussed earlier), and plant the new lawn. For more information on lawn renovation, see the UC Guide to Healthy Lawns .",

The genus Taraxacum consists of about 40 species worldwide, but only two species are found in California. Taraxacum officinale is found as a weed throughout California and T. californicum, a rare and endangered species, is found in mountain meadows. Dandelion was introduced from Europe where it has been used as an herb and medicinal plant since the time of the Roman Empire. The leaves and flowers are often used to make salads, beer, and wine. Mature leaves can be dried and used to make a mild tea. Roots can be used to make stronger tea, or dried and used for various medicinal purposes, including as a mild diuretic. While dandelion does have its benefits, in this publication dandelion will be discussed as an undesirable weed in residential landscapes with options on how to manage it.",

    "damagePestNote": "Dandelions can form a dense mat of leaves (6 to 14 inches in diameter), that can crowd out desirable species and reduce the vigor of those plants that survive. In turf, it forms clumps that cause poor footing for athletic fields and golf courses. Dandelion's texture and color vary from that of turfgrass, and the yellow flowers reduce the aesthetic quality of the lawns and other turf areas. Dandelion flowers may attract bees, which can be problematic where children or people with bee allergies are present.",
    "managementPestNote": "Removing dandelions by hand-pulling or hoeing is usually futile, unless done repeatedly over a long period of time, because of the deep tap root system of established plants. Control by this method is most successful in home lawns and small gardens. Turfgrass and ornamental areas should be well maintained for maximum vigor, making them as competitive as possible to slow dandelion infestations. Dandelion seeds can be moved by equipment or become windborne and travel several miles, making prevention of new infestations very difficult. Dense stands of turfgrass and ornamentals shade the soil surface, reducing the establishment of new dandelion seedlings. Solitary new dandelion plants along fence rows, roadsides, flower beds, and in turfgrass should be grubbed out (removed by digging out the entire plant, taproot and all) before they produce seed. Dandelion knives and similar specialized tools are available for removing individual weeds and their roots while minimizing soil disturbance. Monitor the area for several months to make sure that removal of the taproot was complete. Watch the short UC IPM video “ How to Remove Dandelions ” which discusses various tools and considerations for removing dandelions by hand. Lawns and Turfgrass No single control procedure has been successful in controlling dandelion in turfgrass. Early grubbing of new seedlings should be practiced diligently and regularly for several years to successfully reduce the dandelion population. Many broadleaf weeds may be controlled with mowing by cutting off the growing points and upright parts of the plant, which may lead to drying out and eventual death, but this is NOT true of dandelion. Because it grows from a basal rosette that is lower than a mower blade can reach, mowing will have no effect on control. Spot-spraying isolated plants with translocated herbicides (glyphosate, triclopyr, 2,4-D, dicamba, MCPA, mecoprop, and others) (Table 1) can be helpful. Glyphosate is a nonselective herbicide that will kill turfgrass, leaving open areas, while the others will not injure most grass species. Triclopyr should not be used on Bermudagrass or other warm-season turf species. Overseed any open spots with grass seed similar to the existing turf species to reestablish a vigorous lawn. Two herbicides—carfentrazone, a conventional broadleaf herbicide, and iron HEDTA, a product classified as a biopesticide (although not organic)—have both shown promise for quick burndown and control of small dandelion seedlings. Some preemergence herbicides such as those containing dithiopyr or isoxaben have been effective in managing dandelions. Like all preemergence herbicides, these must be applied to the soil before the seeds germinate. Landscape Plantings There are few options for the control of dandelions in ornamental landscape plantings. Prevention, such as the use of mulch, is very important. Mulching with landscape fabrics can be particularly effective for controlling seedlings, reducing the amount of light that is able to reach the soil. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or black polyethylene (plastic tarp) to block all plant growth. Fabric mulches should be covered with mulch (wood chips, bark, or other materials) to improve aesthetics and to reduce photodegradation. Mulches such as wood chips or bark may also be effective if they are maintained at a depth of least 3 inches deep. If these materials are used without a landscape material, additional wood chips will need to be added as the mulch layer breaks down over time. Organic materials, such as wood chips, will break down and provide a growth medium for new dandelion seedlings if not properly maintained. Spot treatment of solitary plants with a postemergence herbicide can often save time and money. Frequent hand-pulling or hoeing is helpful if done during the year, but regrowth from the extensive perennial root system limits the effectiveness of this method. The preemergence herbicides (see Table 1) isoxaben, indaziflam, and oxyfluorfen applied to the soil before dandelion seeds germinate have been useful in limiting infestations. Because of dandelion's extended germination period, the area must be monitored regularly to determine when the herbicide must be reapplied. If isoxaben or indaziflam are used without postemergence herbicides, be sure to remove all existing dandelions and lightly hoe any seedlings that emerged after the application. If oxyfluorfen is used, do not disturb the soil after application. Many home gardening products combine these preemergence herbicides with postemergence herbicides that can kill young dandelion plants, but will only temporarily \"knock down\" established perennial dandelions, which in most cases survive. Many forms of organically accepted products are now available. All of these products are contact herbicides and will only affect the part of the plant directly sprayed. Many of these products are botanically based oils (e.g., clove oil, eugenol, and d-limonene), or fatty acid soaps (e.g., pelargonic acid and nonanoic acid), or acetic acid. These products control weeds by destroying the leaf cuticle or causing cell leakage that rapidly leads to plant death. They may control small dandelions but will not control established perennial plants and have no residual (lasting) activity so seeds that germinate after application will not be controlled. Many residents have tried vinegar to control dandelion and other weeds. Household vinegar is usually 5% acetic acid and is not effective in killing dandelion, nor is it designed to be used as a pesticide. It is important to note that many of the commercial horticultural (herbicidal) vinegar products available in stores and online are sold at a concentration of 20% acetic acid and carry a DANGER signal word to indicate its potential for acute toxicity when a person is exposed. To be effective, commercial herbicidal vinegar products should be used at full strength (not diluted) and handled with extreme care. It is very important to wear eye protection and gloves when using the herbicidal form of acetic acid. As with any pesticide, always read the product label carefully and follow the instructions. Few postemergence herbicides are registered for use in established ornamental plantings. Spot treatment with the postemergence herbicides listed above can control existing dandelion plants, but do not allow the spray or drift to contact desirable plants or injury will result. Do not use any herbicide unless the label instructions allow it.\tTABLE 1.

    "damagePestNote": "Dallisgrass creates an unsightly clump in turfgrass that can be a problem in golf courses, sports playing fields, and home landscapes. The stiff clumps are much coarser in texture than other grasses common in developed recreational areas such as lawns, golf courses, or parks and can present a hazard in sports fields and play areas, causing people to fall. It has a faster growth rate than turfgrasses. The flower stalks (racemes) often escape mowing and spring back up above the rest of the turfgrass, causing problems in golf courses and sports fields as well as lending a rough, uneven appearance to lawns.",
    "managementPestNote": "A major component of dallisgrass management is preventing establishment of new plants. In home landscapes, removing young plants by digging them out before they form rhizomes or set seed is the best strategy for control. Mature plants can also be dug out, but they sometimes grow back if rhizomes are left behind. In professionally managed turfgrass areas, prevention is an important component in managing this weed. When dallisgrass is abundant or the plants are located over a large area, it may be necessary to supplement cultural practices with herbicides. Prevention Dallisgrass can be introduced into lawn areas with new turfgrass seed or sod, but often the seed is introduced on mowers that have been used in contaminated sites and then moved to weed-free sites. Cleaning a mower after mowing a contaminated site should reduce the chance of invasion into new areas. Inspect sod before taking delivery to make sure dallisgrass is not present. Don’t use soil from dallisgrass-contaminated areas to repair low or bare spots in lawns. In dallisgrass-infested areas delay or minimize the amount of aeration performed on the turfgrass in spring when new seedlings germinate to avoid small open areas where dallisgrass plants might become established. Cultural Control Because dallisgrass is a perennial plant, persistence is required to kill it with cultural practices. In lawn areas the clumps can be removed by digging. Mowing the turfgrass will not remove dallisgrass, but when turfgrass is mowed at its optimum height, it is better able to resist an invasion of this weed. When dallisgrass has been established for some time in the turfgrass, seed will be abundantly present in the soil. In well-established turfgrass, seedlings may not be able to establish, but if there are open areas in the turf, seed will germinate in these areas. If bare areas are present, overseed them with desirable turfgrass species to reestablish the turf. Dallisgrass is not normally a problem in ornamental beds, but if it does occur, the plants can be dug out and a thick layer of mulch laid over the area to control the seedlings. Along roadsides and fences or in orchards and vineyards, the plants can be dug out during summer and left in place for the clumps of rhizomes to dry. As long as all the rhizomes are dug up and dried, the plant will not regrow. New seed will continue to germinate and establish unless the seedlings are removed. Mulching with organic materials is not very effective for the control of mature dallisgrass. However, if the tops of the plants are removed down to the soil line, laying black plastic or landscape fabric over the area will control the remainder of the plant as well as any new seedlings. Summer solarization with clear plastic significantly helps control dallisgrass seed and reduces rhizome regrowth. For information on solarization, see the publication Soil Solarization: A Nonpesticidal Method for Controlling Diseases, Nematodes, and Weeds. Chemical Control Where digging out clumps of dallisgrass in turfgrass is not practical, herbicides may be used. Herbicides to control established plants are referred to as postemergent herbicides. These herbicides are either selective and kill only specific weeds, or they are nonselective and kill any plant they come in contact with. To control germinating seed, preemergent herbicides are used. In order to obtain complete control of this perennial grass weed, it is necessary to control both the established dallisgrass plant and the germinating seed. Established Plants in Turfgrass The postemergent herbicides MSMA or CMA (such as Weed-Hoe or Weed-B-Gon Crabgrass Killer for Lawns) can be used by home gardeners to control clumps of dallisgrass growing in lawns. These herbicides are relatively selective and must be applied two to three times at 3-week intervals in the summer. The turfgrass and dallisgrass should be in good growing condition before application. Also, it is best if the turf is left unmowed for 2 weeks before the first application to create the maximum amount of leaf area for coverage by the herbicide spray. Withhold irrigation for 24 hours after application. Don’t apply these herbicides during extremely hot weather and check the label for rate adjustments during warm weather to minimize the risk of injuring the turfgrass. There are some restrictions on turfgrass types where these products can be used, such as on St. Augustinegrass. Foramsulfuron (Revolver) is a new postemergent herbicide for control of cool-season grass weeds and turf species in warm season lawns. It can only be used in bermudagrass and zoysiagrass lawns and has good weed control activity on dallisgrass, but be aware that it is harmful to most cool season turfgrasses. This product is only available to professional applicators at this time, but may be used on residential lawns. Some turf managers and home gardeners use the nonselective herbicide glyphosate (Roundup) to control dallisgrass in turf. Glyphosate kills both the dallisgrass and the turfgrass, leaving an area of dead turf. To keep the turf vigorous and growing well enough to out compete germinating dallisgrass seed, the spot needs to be overseeded or a preemergent herbicide needs to be applied. Sometimes dallisgrass is not entirely killed after an herbicide treatment, even though the turf is severely damaged or killed, and retreatment may be required. Other nonselective postemergent herbicides are not as effective as glyphosate. Seed in Turfgrass Preemergent herbicides can be used in established turfgrass to control germinating dallisgrass seed. Apply preemergent herbicides in late winter or early spring before dallisgrass seed germinates. Herbicides that control crabgrass such as benefin + oryzalin, bensulide, DCPA, dithiopyr, oryzalin, oxadiazon pendimethalin or prodiamine, are also effective on dallisgrass. (Bensulide, DCPA, and oxadiazon are for professional use only and may have some restrictions for use on residential lawns.) Preemergent herbicides used on lawns need to be irrigated into the soil with about 1/2 inch of water relatively soon after application in order to become effective. Consult the label for application details. Ornamental and Noncrop Areas In ornamental or noncrop areas, glyphosate can be used as a nonselective treatment to control established plants. Apply glyphosate when dallisgrass is flowering but before seed has been produced. The preemergent herbicides napropamide, oryzalin, pendimethalin, or combinations of benefin plus oryzalin are effective to prevent dallisgrass seed from germinating. Benefin plus trifluralin is also available, but only for use by commercial pest controllers. Once seedlings appear, then postemergent herbicides may be necessary to control them chemically.",

    "damagePestNote": "In turfgrass, kikuyugrass forms thick mats that crowd out desirable species. The thick mat makes golf and other athletic uses difficult and in some cases dangerous. The light green color and coarse texture of kikuyugrass is not aesthetically desirable compared to other turf species. In golf courses it often invades greens and requires hand removal. In ornamental areas it invades ground covers and flower beds, often completely choking them out. Kikuyugrass can invade low-growing shrubs, blocking out light and reducing their vigor. In orchards it can compete with trees for nutrients, interfere with irrigation by blocking sprinklers and emitters or drainage ditches, and overgrow fences.",
    "managementPestNote": "The best way to control kikuyugrass is to prevent its spread into new areas. Kikuyugrass can be spread both from seed and from stem sections. It seems to be most commonly spread by mowing, cultivation, and renovation equipment. Clean equipment to remove any kikuyugrass seed or stem sections before moving it out of infested areas. Kikuyugrass also spreads in contaminated soil, sod, and planting stock. Make sure any incoming materials are free of contamination. Maintain turfgrass and ornamental areas to assure they are at maximum vigor so that these plantings are as competitive as possible to help slow the invasion of this weed. Monitor areas and remove patches as soon as possible. Dense turfgrass and ornamental plantings shade the soil surface, making the establishment of kikuyugrass sprigs and seedlings more difficult, although it still may become established. Vigorous tall fescue varieties can reduce kikuyugrass invasion but not to a great enough extent to consider it a method of control in turfgrass. In fact, once kikuyugrass is about 40% of the turf, it often is easier to maintain it as the primary turf species rather than try to suppress it. Regularly inspect orchards and noncrop areas for the presence of kikuyugrass. Remove kikuyugrass by digging up patches or spot-treating it with an herbicide to prevent its spread. Solarization may control infestations in areas that are to be replanted. For solarization to be effective, it must be used in full sun during the hottest part of the year (generally mid-July to mid-September for most of California), and the area must be kept covered with clear plastic mulch for 4 to 6 weeks. (See Pest Notes: Soil Solarization for Gardens and Landscapes in References.) It is unlikely that solarization will be effective in coastal locations due to seasonal fog and overcast skies. Turfgrass A single treatment or procedure can’t control kikuyugrass in turfgrass. A vigorously growing turf coupled with early grubbing (i.e., removal of the entire plant, roots and all) of solitary infestations has been successful when practiced diligently. Spot-spraying isolated plants with glyphosate can be helpful but also will kill the surrounding turfgrass, leaving open areas into which kikuyugrass easily can reestablish. Overseed the open spots with the desired grass species. Kikuyugrass seeds are more likely to grow in less vigorous or thin turf. Overseeding and fertilizing will make the desired turf more competitive and reduce weed establishment from seeds. When applied in March, preemergent herbicides have been successful in limiting germination of kikuyugrass seeds in spring and early summer. Products containing bensulide, benefin, dithiopyr, pendimethalin, and prodiamine are available for home use. To control established plants, multiple applications of a postemergent herbicide are required. In cool-season turfgrass (e.g., Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and perennial ryegrass) about three to four applications per year may be necessary; apply an herbicide whenever you observe new growth. Spot sprays of glyphosate are effective, but this also will kill surrounding turf. Selective postemergent suppression can be obtained from multiple applications of triclopyr (on cool-season turf) and quinclorac on most warm-season turf species. As noted above, it usually is easier and more sustainable to maintain kikuyugrass as the turf species when it is it about 40% of the lawn. However, if you choose to renovate an entire lawn and replant with another turf species, solarization may be used as an alternative to herbicides. Ornamentals There are few options for the control of kikuyugrass in ornamental plantings. Prevention is very important as is hand removal or spot-spraying of solitary plants. Hand weeding is the primary method of control in the home garden. Cultivation or hand hoeing, although possible under some circumstances, generally is detrimental because it breaks rhizomes and transplants them to new areas. This is particularly true if irrigation follows hoeing. Mulching with a strong landscape fabric can be effective if it is overlapped and no light is allowed to penetrate to the soil. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or black polyethylene (i.e., plastic tarp) to block all plant growth. Organic mulches may not offer effective control of kikuyugrass, because plants sprouting from rhizomes can grow through the mulch. Preemergent herbicides such as those listed above can be used to limit the germination of seeds in sites where product labels allow their use. However, kikyuygrass produces little seed unless mowed, so seeds are a minor source of establishment in landscape beds. Preemergent herbicides are of little benefit if established kikuyugrass already is present, because these materials prevent only seed germination. Use postemergent herbicides to control kikuyugrass in established ornamental plantings. Selective grass control herbicides reduce kikuyugrass growth in plantings where product labels allow their use. Sethoxydim and fluazifop are available for use by the home gardener; professional pesticide applicators may also use clethodim. Spot treatments with glyphosate will kill kikuyugrass but also will injure surrounding desirable plants if spray contacts them. Applying glyphosate with a sponge or wick applicator may allow more selectivity. Noncrop In noncrop areas kikuyugrass grows only where water is readily available, such as in ditch banks. Avoid discing kikuyugrass in these areas, as it may increase its population. Residual, soil-applied herbicides used in noncrop weed control will kill germinating kikuyugrass seedlings and limit growth of established kikuyugrass. A postemergent application of glyphosate, either as a spot treatment or as a broadcast application, controls established kikuyugrass. Solarization, as discussed above, may be used if appropriate to the situation.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74139.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Invasive plants are a distinct group of weeds that occur in natural habitats. The purpose of this Pest Note is to clarify how invasive plants differ from common garden and agricultural weeds, to describe the occurrence and impact of invasives in California, to discuss how invasives can be spread through sales or movement of ornamental plants, and to identify approaches for managing invasive plants. DEFINITIONS AND CLASSIFICATION In most cases we think of weeds as native and non-native plants that impact crop production, either in commercial settings or in home fruit and vegetable gardens. Weeds may cause health problems in livestock, pets, and humans and are aesthetically unpleasing in turf and urban landscapes. In contrast, invasive plants are generally non-natives that infest natural ecosystems, including wildlands, rangelands, and pastures. Table 1 shows the differences between agricultural or garden weeds and invasive plants.\tTable 1. Difference between designation of a plant as a general weed or an invasive.\nAgricultural or garden weeds\tInvasive plants\nIntroduction\tUsually accidental by people, animals, equipment, or seed contamination.\tCan be accidental, but more often the original intention was for ornamental or aquarium use, or for forage, food, fiber, medicinal, or soil stabilization purposes.\nDisturbance\tRequire human disturbance to establish and persist.\tBenefit from human disturbance, but disturbance not required.\nPersistence\tWill not persist without human disturbance, usually soil tillage, fertilization, or irrigation.\tOnce introduced, plants survive and spread on their own without further human assistance.\nLife form\tPrimarily terrestrial annuals or herbaceous perennial species.\tAll growth forms, including aquatic, climbing vines, parasitic, herbaceous, or woody plants. Can have annual, biennial, or perennial life cycles.\nNaturalized and Invasive Defined \"Invasive\" and \"naturalized\" are terms used frequently in reference for both non-native plants in wildland areas and garden plants. The term \"naturalized\" is used to describe a non-native plant that is capable of surviving and reproducing without human intervention for an indefinite period. Naturalized plants that do not spread away from where they were introduced and are not generally a significant problem either in a garden or in a natural habitat. However, naturalized species that do spread and survive in new areas are called invasive plants. Invasive plants often cause ecological disruption to natural ecosystems, but the severity of the impact varies considerably based upon the plant species and the area being invaded. The worst invasive species, such as saltcedar, Tamarix ramosissima and yellow starthistle, Centaurea solstitialis, have caused substantial changes to the character, condition, form, and nature of the invaded habitat. In scientific literature, these species are sometimes referred to as landscape transformers. Noxious Defined \"Noxious\" is a legal term used by regulatory agencies, such as the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) and the U. S. Department of Agriculture Animal Plant Health Inspection Service (USDA-APHIS). To be considered noxious, a plant has to be listed on a noxious weed list maintained by one or both of these agencies. Listing is typically based upon the threat of this weed to agriculture or noncrop areas and allows these agencies, along with the county agricultural commissioner, to ban, quarantine, or eradicate these plants. In California, CDFA has more recently listed invasive plants based on their threat to or impact on wildlands. INVASIVE PLANTS OF CALIFORNIA California boasts the greatest natural botanical diversity of any state in the United States, with nearly 5,000 native plant species. In addition to native species, there are about 1,500 non-native species that have become established in the state. About 250 to 300 of these are weeds of agricultural crops, turf, or gardens. The remaining 1,200 or so are naturalized plants of wildlands or disturbed noncrop areas, some of which are important invasive plants. The California Invasive Plant Council (Cal-IPC), a nonprofit organization, has produced a useful inventory of invasive plants. Using a process based upon 13 criteria or questions, they have listed about 215 species as threats to California's wildlands (see www.cal-ipc.org). These 13 criteria fall into three groups:\tEcological impact\tInvasive potential\tCurrent distribution\tThis list does not have legal standing but is based upon the best available published literature and knowledge of invasive plant experts from California. It is a good guide to the invasive plants that can cause the greatest amount of damage to the environment and provides a wealth of background information on each plant on the list. The list notes the types of ecosystems invaded, the regions of the state invaded, and a general ranking (High, Moderate, or Limited) of the plants according to their statewide ecological impact. This ranking is a useful guide to the overall severity of a species, but it does not mean that a plant listed as \"Limited\" is not a significant problem in only one area of the state, or that a \"High\" ranking means the plant is present everywhere in California. Within the inventory, there are currently 42 plants listed as highly invasive, 93 as moderately invasive, and 80 as limited invasiveness. Of these invasive plants, the majority are biennial or perennials (46%), winter annuals (25%), or woody plants (22%). Impacts Invasive plants can cause significant economic and ecological damage in natural areas. From an economic standpoint, invasive species can reduce livestock forage quality and quantity, jeopardize animal and human health, increase the threat of fire or flooding, interfere with recreational activities, or lower land value. In addition, aquatic weeds can also impact the movement and navigation of private and commercial vessels, block irrigation systems, and impede livestock access to water. Ecological Change Invasive plants can cause dramatic ecological changes that impact both plant and animal communities. This is often due to landscape transformations that reduce the adaptability and competitiveness of more desired native species. Such transformations can be caused by the excessive use of resources by invasive plants. These include an increased ability to capture light, consume water or nutrients, or deplete gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide) in aquatic systems. For example, a 10,000-acre infestation of giant reed, Arundo donax, on the Santa Ana River in Orange County is estimated to use 57,000 acre feet more water per year than native vegetation. Invasive plants can transform environments in many ways:\tChanging the soil fertility of the ecosystem.\tPromoting a shorter (or in some cases longer) interval between fires that is not conducive to the survival of native species.\tStabilizing sand dunes in areas adapted to constant fluxes.\tPromoting soil erosion by increasing water runoff down slopes.\tColonizing intertidal mudflats used for shorebird feeding grounds.\tAccumulating leaf litter that acts as a suppressive mulch, which prevents the establishment of more desirable species.\tCreating a saline environment as roots absorb salts from deep in the soil and redistribute them from the foliage to the soil surface.\tThese mechanisms create a more suitable environment for invasive species, at the expense of native plants, leading to a reduction in desirable plant diversity. Such impacts change the biological structure and relationships with other organisms in an area. For example, insects are often the source of nutrition for birds and reptiles. Many native insects are able to feed only on specific native plant species. If their preferred plants are crowded out by invasive plants, insect numbers can be dramatically reduced by the lack of sufficient food. This can subsequently cause a decrease in the animals that feed on them. It has been reported that sections of rivers heavily infested with giant reed plants are nearly devoid of songbirds due to a lack of food. Often native birds do not nest in the branching pattern that is characteristic of many invasive plants. In addition, dense stands of invading saltcedar near desert rivers and oases cause another situation with unforeseen consequences, creating ideal cover for large carnivores such as cougars and coyotes. This makes it very risky for deer, bighorn sheep, and other prey animals to approach these water sources. California has limited and diminishing untouched natural habitats, especially in regions of the state highly populated by humans. Infestations of invasive plants severely degrade the value of these sensitive sites. Many of these remaining natural areas are home to plants and animals listed as \"Threatened and Endangered\" by the U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service or the California Department of Fish and Wildlife. The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service reports that more than 400 of the over 1,300 species currently protected under the Endangered Species Act are considered to be at risk at least partly due to displacement by, competition with, and predation by invasive species, including plants. Invasive Plants Originating from the Horticultural Industry Of the species listed on the California Invasive Plant Council Inventory, about 37% were accidentally introduced to the state as contaminants of seed, clothing, equipment, vehicles, soil, ballast, animals, or packing materials. The remaining 63%, however, were intentionally introduced as landscape, pond or indoor ornamentals, aquarium plants, soil stabilization species, animal forage species, or human food, fiber, or medicinal plants. Almost 80% of these intentionally introduced plant species came through the nursery industry as ornamental landscape species. Twenty-nine of these plants are listed on the California Department of Food and Agriculture noxious weed list, allowing them to be regulated by this agency and the local agricultural commissioner. The rest of the invasive plants that came from nursery introductions can still be imported and traded in California without restriction. Between 2011 and 2016, UC Master Gardener volunteers visited between 223 and 265 nurseries in 35 to 38 California counties to conduct a survey of the retail availability of a selection of landscape ornamentals that are also described as invasive species (Table 2). The results indicate that a few invasive species are available in the majority of garden centers and other retail outlets, some are readily available, and some are uncommon. In addition, many invasive species that are widespread in California and were introduced through the nursery industry are no longer being sold or are rarely for sale. This includes bridal broom, capeweed, crystalline iceplant, giant reed, jubatagrass, myoporum, red sesbania, Russian-olive, saltcedar, Tasmanian blue gum, and bridal, French, Portuguese, and Spanish broom. Most encouraging is that the sales of many invasive plants, such as big periwinkle, Chinese tallowtree, green fountaingrass, and Scotch broom have begun to decrease over the period of these surveys. Only the most recently surveyed invasive plants, including Mexican feathergrass and water hyacinth, have not shown reduction over the past three years of the survey. Overall, there has been a significant reduction in the percentage of nurseries selling invasive plants. In 2012, 30% of nurseries sold at least one invasive plant; but in 2015 only13% of nurseries sold the same invasive plants surveyed in 2012. Thus, it appears that the efforts to reduce the sale of invasive plants in California are succeeding, although not yet completely successful. Additional species that were introduced to California through the nursery industry and are on the California Invasive Plant Council Inventory are listed in Table 3. Some of these species are also common in the nursery trade, while others may be hard to find. However, even though some of these species may be difficult to find locally, virtually any plant can be purchased interstate via catalogs and the Internet.\tTable 2.

What makes nursery species more invasive than other introduced species? Many of the characteristics required for a plant species to be successful as a landscape ornamental are also qualities that can lead to invasiveness in natural settings (Table 4). These shared characteristics are the reason that 48% of the invasive plant species had their origins in the horticultural trade.\tTable 4.

    "managementPestNote": "There are three basic aspects of weed control that also apply to invasive plants: prevention, eradication, and management. Each of these is discussed below. The control of invasive plants uses many of the same tools and tactics used for control of other weeds, including mechanical, chemical, cultural, and biological controls. Some management options used to control invasive species in rangelands or wildlands are not generally available in urban or agricultural landscapes. Examples are prescribed burning, grazing, revegetation programs, and much more extensive use of biological control agents. In most cases, integrated approaches using combinations of these methods are more effective for long-term suppression of invasive species and for recovery of the land to a more functional and productive ecosystem. Prevention Rather than waiting for an invasive plant to become a problem, it is always better to prevent potential invasives from entering an area and becoming established or naturalized. With accidentally introduced invasive plants, such as yellow starthistle, prevention includes many familiar principles used to avoid weed introduction or to manage agricultural weeds. Yellow starthistle seed, for example, typically arrives in a new area as a contaminant in soil or crop seed (particularly alfalfa forage or hay), on or in a grazing animal, or on a vehicle or piece of equipment. When leaving an area where there are invasive plants, it is important not to transport any reproductive parts, such as fruit, seed, or root pieces, to areas where that plant has not established. Sale of invasive plants in nurseries. Managing the spread of invasive plants introduced through the horticultural trade is more challenging. Gardeners, as well as others in the landscape and nursery profession, often prefer \"exotic\" plants because they add new and different species to landscapes and gardens. Therefore, new non-native plant species are constantly being sought and introduced to California, but only a small percentage of them are likely to become invasive. Because the undesirable impacts of invasive plants on natural habitats are becoming more widely recognized, especially by conservation organizations and government agencies, the nursery industry has begun to understand the need to manage new plant introductions to minimize this problem. Some nurseries and botanic gardens have instituted voluntary programs to eliminate known invasive plants and to recommend non-invasive alternatives. Scientists at the University of California, Davis have recently developed a 20-question Plant Risk Evaluation tool that can accurately predict whether a newly introduced plant has a high potential for escape from cultivation. The PlantRight program, administered through Sustainable Conservation, promotes horticultural alternatives to invasive plants on their website. The site targets specific regions of the state or growth forms of invasive plants (e. g. woody plants, aquatic plants) and recommends native and non-native plants that have the same form or function as the undesirable species but are not invasive in wildland or natural areas. The key element is to know what horticultural plants are invasive in your area of the state and to avoid planting them in your garden. If a plant listed on their website is invasive in your region of the state, it should be avoided for landscape use, especially for locations near natural areas. It may be safe to use in other regions, but sometimes the plant is not listed as invasive in an area merely because it has not yet become a presence. Disposing of invasive plant material. If the plant already exists in your garden, what is the best thing to do? Again, if your garden is near natural habitat areas, or near roads, flood channels, or waterways that might be corridors these plants can use to get to open space, then removal should be considered. At the very least, the plant should be kept in a vegetative state so it does not reproduce. If you choose to remove these plants, it is important to dispose of them carefully. Make sure any reproductive parts do not escape during the removal process. In locations that have mandatory green waste programs, cut off any reproductive parts and bag them separately for disposal, then send or take the rest of the green waste to the compost system.\nEradication: Early Detection and Rapid Response Eradication refers to the complete elimination of a pest. The principle behind eradication is to kill the plant before it reproduces or spreads. After prevention, eradicating a small population of an invasive plant is the most cost-effective pest control tactic. The California Department of Food and Agriculture, assisted locally by the county agriculture commissioner, has a long history of eradicating noxious weeds throughout the state. Many of their eradication efforts have been very successful and have kept small weed incursions from becoming widespread problems. Eradication has two components: early detection and rapid response (often referred to as EDRR). The gardening public can assist by learning to recognize when a new plant is expanding beyond where it was planted and either remove it right away or report it to the local county agriculture commissioner. Management in Natural Areas Invasive plants can invade natural areas, particularly when those areas are surrounded by or adjacent to urban environments. These natural areas are typically owned by a public entity, including parks and open-space districts, or privately by a non-profit organization, such as The Nature Conservancy. It is the responsibility of these organizations to manage invasive plants on their property. Many of these organizations have volunteer programs to remove invasive plants and can always use more help. Often these agencies or non-profit organizations have information on their invasive plant programs at their visitor centers or on their websites. Most state and federal agencies that manage land, such as the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, State Parks, the National Park Service, and the U. S. Bureau of Land Management, have extensive information on invasive plants and animals on their websites. A good place to start is at the USDA Agricultural Library National Invasive Species Information Center . It is also important to recognize that management of invasive plants needs to consider sensitive plants and animals. For example, in Southern California, public agencies that manage or regulate rivers and streams restrict invasive plant control activities from spring to fall because threatened and endangered birds, such as the Least Bell's Vireo or Southwestern Willow Flycatcher, nest during this period. There are often rare species of native plants that also need to be protected in many of these infested sites.\n",

The genus Kyllinga consists of about 40 species that are distributed worldwide in subtropical and warm temperate regions. Green kyllinga has been reported as a weed problem from Florida across the Southeastern United States into Arizona, California, and Hawaii. In California it occurs from San Diego to the Sacramento Valley. Green kyllinga is believed to have originated in Asia and was reported as a weed in California more than 50 years ago. However, it has developed into a major problem for turfgrass and landscape managers during the last 10 to 15 years.

The genus Kyllinga consists of about 40 species that are distributed worldwide in subtropical and warm temperate regions. Green kyllinga has been reported as a weed problem from Florida across the Southeastern United States into Arizona, California, and Hawaii. In California it occurs from San Diego to the Sacramento Valley. Green kyllinga is believed to have originated in Asia and was reported as a weed in California more than 50 years ago. However, it has developed into a major problem for turfgrass and landscape managers during the last 10 to 15 years. Green kyllinga is sometimes confused with purple or yellow nutsedge, but its growth habits, reproduction, and morphology are different.",
    "damagePestNote": "Green kyllinga can be a major weed problem for turfgrass and landscape managers. In turf it forms a weak sod that gives poor footing for athletic fields and golf courses. Although green kyllinga is most often a problem in bermudagrass, it has been found in cool-season turf species as well. Green kyllinga has a texture and color that varies from normal turfgrass species and reduces the aesthetic quality of the turf. Also, green kyllinga grows faster than most turfgrass species, which gives infested turfgrass an undulating or irregular surface in as little as two days after mowing. Once a few plants become established in turfgrass or ornamental areas, spread can be rapid. In warm weather, rhizomes can grow by more than 1 inch per day, forming thick mats in just a few weeks. Mowing, foot traffic, and cultivation spread both seed and rhizomes. This allows the production of new plants and hastens spread.",
    "managementPestNote": "The best management approach is to prevent new infestations by excluding and monitoring for the weed. Thoroughly clean mowers and cultivation equipment before moving from infested to weed-free areas. If solitary plants of green kyllinga are found, they should be grubbed out (i.e., remove the entire plant, roots and all) and the area monitored for several months to ensure removal was complete. When green kyllinga infests ornamental plantings, it forms a dense mat that crowds out desirable species and reduces the vigor of those plants that survive. Because of the extensive rhizome system in established stands, hand pulling or hoeing to remove green kyllinga usually is futile unless done repeatedly over a long period of time. Digging out plants and surrounding soil with a shovel is likely the best approach for removing rhizomes, although plant removal can be very expensive and not always successful. Once established green kyllinga will continue to spread unless control measures are taken. Turfgrass and ornamental areas should be well maintained to promote maximum vigor and make these plantings as competitive as possible to hinder invasion by the weed. Dense turfgrass and ornamentals will shade the soil surface, making establishment of green kyllinga seedlings difficult. Irrigation systems should be adjusted and managed to eliminate wet conditions that favor green kyllinga. Turfgrass Controlling green kyllinga in turfgrass requires a combination of control procedures. Wet or overwatered areas in turfgrass provide ideal habitat for a green kyllinga invasion. To reduce the chance of invasion or slow the invasion into turfgrass, don't overwater the turf. If low areas stay wet, improve drainage or reduce water applications in that area. Early grubbing of solitary infestations has been successful when practiced diligently. Spot spraying isolated plants with glyphosate can be helpful, but the turfgrass also is killed, leaving open areas that allow reestablishment of kyllinga or invasion of other weed species. The open spots should be overseeded or patched with sod to establish a vigorous turf. Mowing and nitrogen fertilization also affect the growth of green kyllinga. In one study on hybrid bermudagrass, low mowing (i.e., 1 inch compared to 2 inches) resulted in increased green kyllinga seed germination and growth in established turf provided with adequate nitrogen. However, in newly established turf where there was significantly more green kyllinga present, the mowing height didn't have as great an effect, and additions of nitrogen resulted in increased turf cover and less spread of green kyllinga. Unfortunately, eradication wasn't possible with any mowing height or nitrogen rate.\tTable 1.

The use of herbicides can be very effective if combined with cultural methods such as water management and exclusion of green kyllinga from turf and landscape areas. Preemergent herbicides have been successful in limiting germination of green kyllinga seeds. These herbicides should be applied in spring before soil temperatures reach 60°F to limit germination in late spring and early summer. Preemergent materials that are effective include benefin, bensulide, dithiopyr, pendimethalin, and prodiamine. Postemergent herbicides can limit growth of green kyllinga. Herbicide products available for green kyllinga and plants in the sedge family contain halosulfuron, imazosulfuron, MSMA, or trifloxysulfuron. Be sure to select a product that is safe for your existing turfgrass species. The best control has been obtained when halosulfuron is applied in two sequential applications. Make the second halosulfuron application when kyllinga plants show signs of recovering. Even when herbicides are used for control, be sure the turfgrass has adequate drainage to reduce the potential for proliferation by this weed. If turfgrass areas are to be completely renovated with new turf from seed, sod, or stolons, the existing plant material—including green kyllinga—can be treated with a nonselective herbicide such as glyphosate prior to planting. Ornamental Landscapes There are few options for the control of green kyllinga in ornamental landscape plantings. Prevention is very important. Hand removal or spot spraying of solitary plants as soon as they are found will save time and money in the long run. Cultivation or hand hoeing must be done carefully, because hoeing can break rhizomes into smaller pieces and “transplant” them to new areas. This is particularly true if irrigation follows hoeing. Mulching with landscape fabrics (e.g., geotextile mulches) can be effective if fabrics are overlapped and no light is allowed to penetrate to the soil. Geotextile mulches combined with hand removal should provide adequate control of green kyllinga in perennial planting beds. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or black polyethylene (plastic tarp) to block all plant growth. Wood chips or bark should be placed on top to inhibit breakdown by UV light. Plant-derived mulches (i.e., organic mulches) alone might not effectively control kyllinga, because it will probably grow through the mulch. Preemergent herbicides such as oryzalin and pendimethalin can be used to limit seedling germination in sites where their use is permitted. Make applications in April before soil temperatures reach 60°F. Preemergent herbicides will be of little benefit if estab­lished kyllinga plants are present. Postemergent herbicides containing halosulfuron are registered for use in established ornamental plantings. Spot treatment with glyphosate can reduce green kyllinga’s growth, but don’t let the spray come in contact with desirable plants or injury will result.",

    "damagePestNote": "Field bindweed is one of the most persistent and difficult-to-control weeds in landscapes and agricultural crops. It has a vigorous root and rhizome system that makes it almost impossible to control with cultivation between desirable plants or broad scale tillage alone; in fact, it often spreads the infestation. Its seed has a long dormancy and can last in soil for up to 60 years. It has a climbing habit that allows the plant to grow up. In addition rhizomes have the ability to penetrate through fabric, plastic, and other barriers. Field bindweed also is very drought tolerant and once established is difficult to control even with herbicides. If field bindweed is present, land is devalued and the weed precludes planting of many vegetable crops.",
    "managementPestNote": "Control of field bindweed isn’t easy, and it can’t be accomplished with a single treatment or in a single season. Effective control requires prevention of seed production, reduction of stored carbohydrates by deep tillage of the root system, competition for light from other plants, and constant vigilance in removing top growth. Application of herbicides, which reduce bindweed growth and kill germinating seedlings, can also be part of an integrated pest management program. Prevention Three practices can reduce the possibility of introducing field bindweed—purchase and plant clean seed and ornamental stock, remove any seedlings before they become perennial plants, and prevent any plants from producing seed. If topsoil is introduced to a site, it should be free of roots, rhizomes, seeds, and other bindweed propagules. It is important to control new infestations when they are small, because spot control is the least expensive and the most effective strategy. Cultural Control Experiments in some annual and perennial crops have demonstrated the effect of shade on bindweed growth. In these studies, alfalfa, cereal grains, sorghums, and corn partially reduced bindweed growth. Shade from shrubs and trees also should reduce growth, especially if there is another planting under the trees and the bindweed isn’t allowed to climb above the foliage of these plants. Seedlings of field bindweed are easy to control with cultivation, but only for about 3 to 4 weeks after germination. After that, perennial buds are formed, and successful control is much more difficult. Cultivation or hoeing has been partially effective in reducing established stands of field bindweed. Cultivate about every 2 to 3 weeks and repeat whenever necessary. In conjunction with cultivation, withholding water to dry the site might help to reduce the perennial population in a summer season, assuming the roots have not tapped into deep moisture. Landscape fabrics such as polypropylene and polyester and other mulches such as black plastic or cardboard have been effective for bindweed control if no light is allowed to reach the soil and the plant. The edges of the fabric must overlap so that the bindweed stems can’t grow between the sheets and into the light. If holes are made in the fabric or plastic for plants, however, bindweed can also grow through these holes. A landscape fabric placed over soil then covered with bark or other plant-derived product (e.g., organic matter) or rock will likely keep field bindweed from emerging. It might take more than 3 years of light exclusion before the bindweed dies. Once landscape fabric or other mulch is removed, new bindweed plants might germinate from seed in the soil; be sure to monitor the site and control any new seedlings. Complete death of the plant under the mulch takes 3 to 5 years. Chemical Control Herbicides have been relatively effective for suppression of bindweed, but have not been very effective for eradication (Table 1). If herbicides are used, supplementing them with appropriate preventive and cultural controls has the most success in eradication. Turfgrass areas In turfgrass areas field bindweed normally isn’t a problem because frequent mowing reduces its vigor, though once established it will persist. Mowing the turfgrass won’t get rid of established bindweed. Bindweed often will flower above the turf. For control, products containing 2,4-D and/or dicamba have been effective without injuring the grass turf. More than one application will have to be made during the summer growing season. Ornamental areas In ornamental landscape settings, field bindweed grows between and up through the canopy of plants. For control, products containing trifluralin, oryzalin, or pendimethalin applied before emergence will reduce perennial shoots and control the germinating seedlings, but they won’t kill established bindweed plants. In open areas where there are no desirable plants, glyphosate (e.g., Roundup and other formulations) using a 2 percent solution is effective when bindweed plants are actively growing with no moisture stress. Glyphosate takes 2 to 3 weeks, depending upon the temperature at treatment, to kill the top growth, but it is effective, even though eradication isn’t always possible. Glyphosate doesn’t have residual activity, so repeated applications are necessary. It won’t affect germination of field bindweed seed, so new seedlings will have to be controlled with mulch, preemergent herbicides, or persistent cultivation. Some people have used a 2 percent solution (volume to volume) of glyphosate to paint the leaves of bindweed in shrub areas, but if you try this be sure not to allow the herbicide to touch mature leaves or green bark of ornamental shrubs or trees, or injury can result. To reduce the chance that glyphosate will contact desirable plants, place the bindweed vines on newspaper before painting the leaves. Once the glyphosate solution has dried on the bindweed leaves, the newspaper can be removed. Any regrowth of the field bindweed must be re-treated. Using a shield such as cardboard or wood is advisable while spraying herbicide treatments near ornamental plants. If an area infested with bindweed is to be planted, irrigate the area to make the bindweed grow well, then treat the field bindweed with glyphosate before planting. After planting, use an appropriate preemergent herbicide or mulch and continue to control any seedlings or regrowth from the previously treated plants.\nTable 1.

For best control, apply glyphosate to the bindweed in fall when the bindweed is actively growing; however, spring treatment has the additional benefit of reducing seed production, vigor, and spread of the plant. Generally, additional applications need to be made when the bindweed regrows. Seedlings must be controlled with mulch, tillage, or preemergent herbicides before they become established plants. Repeated cultivations are required to prevent bindweed from reestablishing. Because the seed lasts such a long time in the soil, control practices must be conducted continuously. See the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines for grapes or specific tree crops for more information on managing weeds. Noncrop areas In areas outside the landscape or orchard, cultivation and herbicide treatment can be used. If herbicides are to be used, treat the bindweed plants before they are drought stressed. Use a translocated herbicide, such as glyphosate, or a combination of glyphosate and dicamba, in areas where its use is allowed, when the plant is actively growing. There is a plant-back interval to crops based on the crop to be planted. Re-treatments will be necessary to control both established plants and seedlings. If possible, grow a competitive planting of other plants to reduce field bindweed growth and a crop that has herbicides available to use.",

It grows in both disturbed and undisturbed sites and can be commonly found along roadsides, fencerows, and ditch banks, as well as in pastures, rangeland, and natural areas. It is sometimes also found growing in field crops. Dyer’s woad is thought to have been introduced into California in the Scott Valley of Siskiyou County, where it is locally referred to as \"Marlahan mustard.\" Until a couple of decades ago, it was primarily confined to Scott Valley, but it has subsequently spilled over into Shasta Valley. It continues to spread throughout Siskiyou County and into Modoc, Shasta, and other northern California counties. During medieval times, dyer’s woad was one of the most valuable plant commodities in Europe, cultivated in southeastern Russia as a source of blue dye as early as the 13th century. Colonists first introduced it to the eastern United States late in the 17th century for the same purpose. Its dye is now only of very minor importance in the U.S., but the plant has successfully invaded and colonized extensive areas of California, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and Montana.

    "managementPestNote": "Like other perennial mustards, dyer’s woad can be difficult to control because of its early rosette growth habit and deep root system. Prevention The most effective control measure for dyer’s woad is prevention. Careful monitoring and sanitation, especially when moving animals or equipment from infested areas, are important. In established infestations, it is critical to prevent plants from producing seed to prevent further spread. Germination assays have shown that some seeds are capable of germinating even when the seedpods are still green. Similarly, plants treated with an herbicide during the flowering period may still produce some viable seed. Therefore, ensure that springtime control measures are in place before plants begin flowering. Cultural Control Hand rogueing or digging individual plants is somewhat effective for small or scattered infestations. It may be necessary to continue removing new plants in an infested area periodically for at least two to three years. Hand removal is difficult because of the deep taproot, and the stems may break off when pulling allowing the plant to re-sprout new shoots. Therefore, depending on soil type, hand hoeing may be easier. If flowers or seedpods are present, plants should be uprooted, bagged, and removed from the field. Cutting or mowing to prevent seed production can be effective, but this requires multiple passes. A single mowing event may delay flowering, but plants will usually re-sprout; cutting plants at least one or two more times is important to prevent seed production completely. Depletion of plant root reserves using repeated cultivation may also be an effective way to control dyer’s woad. However, many sites where plants are established may be rocky, uneven, or isolated; cultivation or mowing may not be feasible here. Seed destruction. It is important to control new infestations of dyer’s woad before they become serious and widespread. Deep burial, removal and disposal, and burning of senescent, seed-bearing “skeleton” plants may assist in minimizing spread from localized infestations. However, dry seeds are easily detached from senescent plants, and care must be taken not to scatter these seeds about during destruction activities. Solar tenting. Another nonchemical tactic used to destroy seeds is solar tenting, a hydrothermal method of inactivating seeds on desiccated skeleton plants. Moistened seeds, enclosed within silicles, are susceptible to high temperatures, even though the silicle provides some protection to seeds, especially dry ones, against heat exposure. Germination can be greatly reduced or eliminated during summer months by immersing seeds in water-filled plastic bags for several weeks. This approach is useful for remote or isolated infestations of dyer’s woad where on-site seed destruction is desirable to prevent spread. Biological Control Experimental trials evaluating a pathogenic rust fungus as a biological control agent of dyer’s woad have been conducted. Rust fungi cause foliar diseases that rarely eradicate all host plants, so their effects on weeds may be restricted to reduced plant vigor and reduced seed production. Therefore, use of a rust fungus is likely to reduce, but not eliminate, dyer’s woad populations. In the future, biological control may be a useful tool within an integrated pest management approach. Chemical Control Chemical control at appropriate growth stages is also effective. Fall treatments have worked well in other states, but these do not seem to be as effective in California, perhaps because our lack of late season rain and associated plant water stress do not allow for herbicide penetration and movement within plants. The most effective herbicides for dyer’s woad control are 2,4-D and chlorsulfuron. 2,4-D does not have soil activity and should be applied to seedlings or rosettes at 2 to 3 quarts per acre (3.8 pounds a.e./gallon) or at a 1% solution for spot treatments. 2,4-D does not inhibit seed set when applied to flowering plants. Chlorsulfuron is generally more effective than 2,4-D and has both post as well as pre-emergence activity, but is restricted to professional use only. The use rate of 1 to 1.33 ounces of product per acre (0.75 to 1 ounce a.i./acre) is most effective when applied pre-emergence to rosette stage. A combination of 2,4-D with chlorsulfuron is also a highly effective treatment. Oftentimes, people do not think to treat dyer's woad until they observe the conspicuous bright-yellow flowers. A field trial was conducted recently to determine whether treating dyer’s woad with glyphosate or 2,4-D herbicide at bloom, early green-seedpod, or late green-seedpod stages had effects on seed production or seed viability. We found that treating at bloom stage or early green-seedpod stage reduced seed production markedly, but did not eliminate it. Glyphosate also controls dyer’s woad but it is usually not the herbicide of choice for broadcast applications because it is non-selective and kills desirable vegetation along with weeds. The use of glyphosate or other herbicides along with a marking dye is an effective measure for tracking spot treatments in large areas. Even when treating during appropriate seasons, multiple herbicide applications over multiple years may be required to attain control since plants in an infested area will continue to emerge each year until the soil seedbank has been depleted. The key objective of any dyer’s woad control program is to prevent viable seed production and dissemination. Regardless of the management program used, several years of control will be needed.",

    "damagePestNote": "Impact varies from moderate to severe reductions of plant growth and, in some cases, complete loss of vigor and death. The severity of an infestation depends on the growth stage of the host plant at the time of initial dodder attachment. With native dodder, the greatest growth reduction occurs when the parasite attaches to seedlings; the infestation usually doesn’t kill established host plants, but when multiple attachments are made to the same host plant, death can occur. Japanese dodder can cover and kill most large shrubs and small trees. The weakened state of infected plants also predisposes them to diseases and insect and nematode invasions.",
    "managementPestNote": "Japanese Dodder If you believe you have Japanese dodder in your landscape, do not try to control it yourself. This weed is under an eradication program in California and has spread to more than a dozen California counties including Alameda, Butte, Contra Costa, Fresno, Los Angeles, Merced, Sacramento, Shasta, Solano, Sutter, Tulare, Yolo, and Yuba. Contact your county agricultural commissioner to receive proper identification and help with control. More information is available on the California Department of Food and Agriculture Web site. Native Dodder The most successful control involves a systematic approach that combines several methods; you usually can’t eliminate dodder with a single treatment or in a single year. If you see native dodders infesting herbaceous landscape and garden plants, take immediate action to eliminate or reduce the infestation. Effective management requires control of the current population, prevention of dodder seed production, and suppression of new seedlings in subsequent years. Where extensive infestations exist, remove the infested host plants and replant with nonhosts; in vegetable gardens rotate to nonhost crops for several years. When you plant a host crop again, remove any new dodder plants as soon as possible. Prevention The use of dodder-free planting seed has long been a primary way of preventing the spread of dodder infestations. Many countries and states have seed laws that prohibit the presence of dodder seed in planting seed. Clean and inspect clothing and equipment before moving from infested to “clean” areas. Once you know an area is infested, you must manage it to prevent the further production of dodder seed. Isolate small infestations, and remove them by hand before the plant produces seed. Monitor larger infestations, and mow, prune, burn, or spray herbicides to prevent seed production. Cultural Control Planting nonhost plants can be an effective means of managing a dodder infestation. Plants that aren’t hosts of dodder include grasses and many other monocots including lilies. Plants that grow primarily during winter such as crucifers and legumes and transplanted trees and shrubs usually are good alternatives. Dodder can’t penetrate tree bark, but it can penetrate tree foliage, if it is able to contact it. Be sure to remove weeds in these plantings, so the weeds don’t serve as hosts for dodder and increase the amount of dodder seed in the soil. Dodder seedlings are difficult to find, but if you see them before they attach to a host, remove them by cultivation or hand pulling. If you see dodder soon after it has attached itself to a host, prune the infected portion of the host plant 1/8 to 1/4 inch below the point of attachment, otherwise the dodder can regenerate from the haustoria left embedded in the host plant. Pruning trees and shrubs generally has been of little benefit unless dodder is confined to one or two branches that you can remove without destroying or disfiguring the entire host plant. If no host plants are present, you can leave cultivated dodder plants on the soil surface to dry and die. However, if you allow freshly removed dodder to contact a healthy host plant, a new connection sometimes occurs. If the dodder plants have set seed, remove the plants from the area to prevent future infestations. Place plants in a plastic bag, and dispose of them in the trash. Dodder seed can survive soil solarization—a method for killing weeds using a clear, plastic tarp and the sun’s heat—probably because of its hard seed coat. Although studies haven’t been conducted, composting might kill most dodder seed, because higher temperatures are reached in the composting process than in solarization. In agricultural settings, cultivate dodder before it attaches to a host plant, since cultivation done after dodder has attached itself to the host is of no benefit. Hand pulling, cutting, or mowing also can reduce dodder infestations. Be sure to break off, cut, or mow the host plant just below the point of dodder attachment (about 1/8 to 1/4 inch) for these methods to be effective. Close mowing is an effective management tool for dodder in alfalfa. Burning reduces a dodder infestation as long as you destroy the invaded tissue of host plants along with the dodder to prevent regeneration of the dodder from embedded haustoria. Burning kills only some of the dodder seed; the amount of seed destroyed depends on the duration and intensity of the fire. Biological Control Several disease organisms are known to infect dodder including Fusarium tricinctum and Alternaria species, which attack swamp dodder (C. gronovii), and A. alternata and Geotrichum candidum, which attack field dodder (C. pentagona) . Researchers in China have found that a suspension of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides can selectively control the dodder species C. chinensis and C. australis in soybeans. Difficulty in culturing and applying these organisms has limited their commercialized use. Resistant Varieties Breeding programs aimed at developing dodder-resistant varieties are not known to exist; however, some varieties of normally susceptible species have some resistance. Several varieties of processing tomatoes, a plant generally susceptible to dodder, have been observed to be either totally resistant or tolerant to dodder attack. Chemical Control Generally chemical control isn’t necessary in the home garden and landscape, since you can control dodder for the most part by cultivating seedlings or through hand removal or pruning. Although pelargonic acid (Scythe) is effective, it also kills any plant tissue it contacts; consequently good coverage and careful spraying are important, so desirable plants aren’t damaged. Where dodder has been a persistent problem in certain commercial agricultural fields or in landscapes, apply preemergent herbicides (e.g., trifluralin) before dodder seed germinates; where practical, follow up with close mowing, burning, or spot removal of parasitized host plants to control dodder plants that escaped the herbicide application. Usually postemergent herbicides, which you apply directly to the dodder plant to control it, don’t selectively control dodder without injuring the host plant and aren’t a good choice for controlling established infestations.",

    "damagePestNote": "Creeping Woodsorrel Creeping woodsorrel is a major weed in turf, ornamental plantings, and nurseries. Infested container stock can contaminate uninfested landscapes. As seedpods mature and expel seeds, creeping woodsorrel spreads from container to container, from flower bed to flower bed, or across ornamental plantings. Creeping woodsorrel can establish rapidly in semishaded areas of new or established grass lawns or low-growing perennial ground covers. It spreads during mowing and other cultural operations. Once established, it is very competitive, because it grows year-round. This makes it particularly troublesome in warm season turf species such as bermudagrass or perennial groundcovers that have a dormancy period. Bermuda Buttercup (Buttercup Oxalis) Bermuda buttercup used to be grown as an ornamental, but once planted it would spread throughout a garden, compete with other plants, and become very difficult to control. It still is plentiful in many landscapes. Although it can spread into the edges of turfgrass, mowing reduces its invasiveness, so it rarely is a problem in lawns. It is a major problem in field-grown flowers and in the home landscape, especially in groundcovers. Bermuda buttercup was first noted in California in the San Francisco Bay region and has since spread throughout most coastal counties, the coastal range, and into the Central Valley. In the last 10 years, this plant has invaded native coastal dunes and natural areas along the coast, leading to the demise of native plants. It is a troublesome weed that is more competitive than is assumed from its general appearance. Due to its extensive occurrence in yards and gardens, Bermuda buttercup has the potential to rapidly spread via the production of bulbs and the movement of contaminated soils into adjacent natural areas. Because it is practically impossible to eradicate infested soils of this weed, take care to prevent Bermuda buttercup from invading wildlands.",
    "managementPestNote": "In many garden situations creeping woodsorrel and Bermuda buttercup can be managed with physical control methods such as handweeding. In other cases, herbicides can be integrated into the management program; see Tables 1 and 2. The effectiveness of control method depends on which weed is present and where the weeds are growing. Creeping woodsorrel The two primary methods for managing creeping woodsorrel are removing established plants and controlling germinating seeds. You can control established plants with handweeding, hand cultivation with hoes and weeding tools, and postemergent herbicides. Try to control plants before they flower and set seed. Infested sites require constant vigilance and continuous weed removal. Control seedlings by preventing seed germination and/or seedling emergence with preemergent herbicides and/or mulches along with continual handweeding. Burying seeds or covering them with mulch to block their exposure to light prevents germination and is an effective way to control seedlings in planting beds; it isn’t a feasible method for lawns. Preemergent herbicides can be used to prevent seedling emergence in most sites where creeping woodsorrel grows. Both pre- and postemergent herbicide selection is dependent upon the site of infestation. Bermuda buttercup (Buttercup oxalis) Bermuda buttercup grows mostly in ornamental beds, where control is difficult and complicated by the presence of ornamental plants. Removing the top of the plant by cultivating or cutting it off won’t kill the bulb. Don’t move soil from an infested site to one that is free of the weed. Handweeding is used extensively to reduce infestations, but because it is exceedingly difficult to remove all of the bulbs, new plants usually appear. Bermuda buttercup isn’t a common problem in lawns. Creeping Woodsorrel in Turfgrass Mowing, fertilizing, or irrigating to control creeping woodsorrel isn’t effective; the more vigorous the turfgrass, the more vigorous the creeping woodsorrel. Creeping woodsorrel survives and sets seed even when mowed as close as 1/4 inch. After using a lawn mower where creeping woodsorrel grows, wash or air spray the machine to remove all seeds and clippings before mowing weed-free turf. Postemergent herbicides All postemergent herbicide applications are more effective when air temperatures are favorable for plant growth and not too hot or too cold. Be sure to follow label instructions and apply the herbicide uniformly over the entire lawn. Some of these products are active in the soil, as indicated on the label, so extra care is needed around shrub and tree roots growing in a lawn. Adding a surfactant (sometimes referred to as an herbicide helper) to the spray mixture, if indicated on the label, increases herbicide coverage and penetration by the leaf. Cool-season turfgrass (bent­grass, Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and ryegrass) Triclopyr and fluroxypyr are two postemergent broadleaf herbicides that are extremely effective in controlling seedling and established creeping woodsorrel plants in cool-season turfgrass lawns. Triclopyr is more readily available to the homeowner than fluroxypyr. These herbicides sometimes are sold in combination with other broadleaf herbicides.\tTable 1.

These materials are available at garden and landscape supply centers. Some combinations are specifically formulated for creeping woodsorrel and provide effective control. Alone, 2,4-D has limited effect on creeping woodsorrel. Often one application of triclopyr is adequate for control, but a follow-up application 3 to 6 weeks later might be necessary for complete control, and a second application is almost always needed for the other products discussed above. Warm-season turfgrass (bermudagrass, buffalograss, kikuyugrass, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass) Triclopyr is harmful to bermudagrass and kikuygrass, so it isn’t labeled for use in warm-season turfgrass lawns as a stand-alone herbicide. However, it has been formulated in a lower concentration and combined with other broadleaf herbicides (e.g. dicamba and MCPA) and is effective on creeping woodsorrel. Fluroxypyr, a similar chemistry to triclopyr, is safer to use in warm-season lawns and is very effective on creeping woodsorrel. Postemergent broadleaf herbicide combinations also are formulated for use in some warm-season turfgrasses. Several of these specifically target creeping woodsorrel and provide effective control.\tTable 2.

Not for use around broadleaf ornamentals or vegetables or warm-season turf.\nPreemergent herbicides for cool and warm-season turfgrasses Once established plants are under control, a preemergent application of dithiopyr, isoxaben, pendimethalin, or prodiamine will effectively prevent oxalis emergence. Oryzalin and oryzalin combined with benefin provide some preemergence activity on creeping woodsorrel. Oryzalin can’t be used in all turfgrass species, so check the label for restrictions and carefully follow the directions for use. These materials are available at garden and landscape supply centers. Preemergent herbicides can be applied any time of the year, and 3 applications per year might be necessary to reduce a heavy infestation and prevent creeping woodsorrel from establishing in lawns. Application timings of early fall, midwinter, and late spring are suggested. Landscape Plantings Before planting in an infested area of either creeping woodsorrel or Bermuda buttercup, soil solarization—a method for killing weeds using a clear, plastic tarp and the sun’s heat—can be used to reduce seed and bulb populations. To achieve the most effective results, perform solarization for a minimum of 4 consecutive weeks during June, July, or August. For more information, see Soil Solarization for Gardens and Landscapes. Creeping woodsorrel Control is difficult in areas with shrubs, herbaceous perennials, or groundcovers, particularly if established creeping woodsorrel plants aren’t under control in other areas of the landscape. Total control of established woodsorrel and its seedlings is necessary in turfgrass, groundcovers, and bedding plants and around shrubs to prevent the weed from reestablishing. In severely infested areas it might be easier to start over and relandscape the site or parts of the landscape, salvaging as many ornamental plants as feasible or desirable. Prior to planting, use soil solarization or cultivate and sprinkle with water to germinate the seeds and then destroy the seedlings to reduce seed populations in the soil. You might need to repeat this process several times. Carefully handweed oxalis around established plants to remove as much of the stem sections as possible, since they easily break. Several weedings usually are necessary to remove old plants, since new ones will grow from stem segments that remain in the soil. To reduce the chance of further infestation, remove the plants from the site to eliminate their seed, then apply a mulch, preemergent herbicide, or both to control seedlings. Two types of mulching materials are effective—geotextile fabrics (landscape fabrics) and organic mulches used alone or on top of geotextile fabrics. When using organic mulches, cover the soil with 2 to 3 inches of mulch. If any light reaches the soil, seeds can germinate, or plant parts can regrow. If seeds drop on the soil between mulch pieces, they usually will germinate and grow; therefore, it is important to use a mulch size that is small enough to fill in most spaces on top of the soil but not so fine (e.g. sawdust) that the seeds will germinate on the mulch. If you are using preemergent herbicides to control creeping woodsorrel, two applications about 8 weeks apart might be necessary to control all of the seedlings. Apply preemergents in the early fall, since this is when most seeds germinate. Dithiopyr, isoxaben, oryzalin, pendimethalin, and prodiamine are available for commercial and homeowner use. Read herbicide labels carefully to determine if applications are safe around bedding plants. Be aware these herbicides also will inhibit germination of any ornamental seeds that are in the site. If using preemergents and mulches, first apply the herbicide, then lay the fabric or spread a thick layer of mulch. No selective postemergent herbicides are available to control creeping woodsorrel in ornamental plantings after the weed has emerged. Bermuda buttercup (Buttercup oxalis) The best control method for this pernicious weed is prevention. If new infestations are spotted and controlled early, it is possible to eradicate small populations. Large populations are difficult to control and will require multiple years of diligent control efforts. Small infestations can be controlled by repeated manual removal of the entire plant. Repeated pulling of the tops will deplete the bulb’s carbohydrate reserves, but these efforts will take years to be successful. Repeated mowing also will eventually deplete the bulb. Cut Bermuda buttercup before it flowers and forms new bulbs. Repeated cutting or cultivation is necessary to reduce plant numbers. The soil from which plants are removed should be carefully examined or sifted to remove bulbs and bulblets, an extremely time- and labor-intensive process. Before planting in an infested area, use soil solarization to further reduce Bermuda buttercup populations. Several postemergent herbicides including triclopyr and fluroxypyr (selective for broadleaf plants) and glyphosate and glufosinate (nonselective) effectively kill the top growth of this weed but are harmful to most ornamentals, so be careful these herbicides don’t drift onto desirable plants. These herbicides don’t kill the bulbs, and regrowth from bulbs should be expected. Researchers around the world are investigating approaches for controlling Bermuda buttercup. Some suggest covering infestations with stiff cardboard, then covering the cardboard with a thick layer of organic mulch to kill the plants and weaken the bulbs, making them less capable of competing with desirable plants. Keep the mulch on the infestation until the mulch and cardboard have rotted, then plant competitive ornamentals into the soil-mulch mixture. Container-grown Ornamentals Bermuda buttercup typically isn’t a problem in container-grown ornamentals; however, creeping woodsorrel is a major problem. When planting new containers, use soil that is free of creeping woodsorrel seeds or Bermuda buttercup bulbs. When purchasing container plants from nurseries, avoid those with either species of Oxalis growing in the pots. If you find mature plants, carefully pull them out to remove all of the roots and/or bulbs. Fabric or organic mulches help prevent seed germination but have little effect on bulb germination.",

    "managementPestNote": "Crabgrass is easy to manage using a variety of cultural and chemical controls. Controlling crabgrass before it sets seed is important, because the seeds can remain viable for at least 3 years in soil. Cultural Control in Turfgrass Because crabgrass spreads and reproduces primarily by seed, any cultural efforts that reduce seed production will decrease occurrences of this weed. Cultural activities that increase the vigor of turfgrass also decrease the potential of crabgrass invasion. These include using the proper mowing height for your specific turf, selecting the best turf species for your area, overseeding to keep turfgrass thick, applying fertilizer at the correct time of year, and proper irrigation. For more information on maintaining vigorous lawns that out compete weeds, see The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns. Mowing height Mowing at the optimum height for turf increases turfgrass vigor and reduces the germination and establishment of crabgrass. Select the proper mowing height from Table 1 for the dominant turfgrass species in your lawn. After mowing crabgrass-infested turf, thoroughly rinse the mower to remove seeds and avoid transferring them to uninfested sites. Species selection Selecting a turfgrass that is adapted to your local conditions also will help produce vigorous turf. Cool-season species (bentgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescues, and perennial ryegrass) are most competitive in coastal and northern regions of California. Some of the newer cultivars of Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and perennial ryegrass are even more competitive and grow better than the older cultivars. For example, tall fescue cultivars used for turf vary in their ability to compete with both smooth and large crabgrass Crabgrass tends to invade the older fescue varieties (Fawn and Kentucky 31), which grow in an open, upright manner. The slower-growing, dwarf-type tall fescue varieties, especially Bonsai, also are susceptible to crabgrass invasion. A newer Bonsai variety (2000) claims a more vigorous growth habit. Warm-season species (bermudagrass, dichondra, St. Augustine grass, and zoysiagrass) are most competitive with weeds in interior valleys and desert regions. Kikuyugrass is more competitive in south coastal regions. In the turf selection process it is important to consider the amount of foot traffic, pest problems, and/or shade, as these factors can significantly impact the vigor of the lawn. For example, hybrid bermuda can be very competitive, but only if it receives adequate sunlight. If it receives fewer than 6 hours of sun during the day, it will grow poorly and weeds can easily invade. Tar Heel tall fescue withstands more foot traffic on the lawn than does the variety Justice. Other newer tall fescue varieties include Barlexas, Coyote, Greenkeeper, and Innovator.\tTable 2. Periods of Active Growth of Cool- and Warm-season Turf Species.\nTurfgrass species\tPeriod of active growth\nCool-season turf\nbentgrass\tMarch–June, September–November\nbluegrass, Kentucky\tlate February–late May, October–December\nfescue, fine\tMarch–June, October–December\nfescue, tall\tMarch–June, October–December\nryegrass, annual (for overseeding)\tOctober–May\nryegrass, perennial\tFebruary–June, October–December\nWarm-season turf\nbermudagrass\tApril–late September\ndichondra\tApril–October\nkikuyugrass\tFebruary–November\nSt. Augustinegrass\tMarch–October\nzoysiagrass\tApril–October\nFertilization Fertilizers can increase turfgrass vigor and reduce the possibility of a crabgrass invasion. The best time to fertilize is when the turf is actively growing, which depends upon your turf species (Table 2). Because seedling crabgrass isn’t very competitive, a vigorously growing turf will crowd out new seedlings. Water management Irrigation timing and amount also can affect crabgrass germination and growth. Overwatered turf or turf that receives daily, light irrigation becomes weak and vulnerable to invasion by this weed. Irrigating once a week will improve turf vigor. Often, crabgrass first appears in open areas with no turf, along sidewalks where the soil can be warmer, or around sprinkler heads where turf is mowed more closely. Cultural Control in the Landscape and Garden In the landscape, you easily can control crabgrass by mulching, hoeing, and hand pulling when the plants are young and before they set seed. You also can control this weed with solarization. Several chemical herbicides are available but often aren’t necessary. Mulch Mulching with wood products (e.g. wood chips or nuggets), composted yard waste, or synthetic landscape fabrics covered with mulch will reduce crabgrass in shrub beds and bedding plants and around trees by blocking sunlight needed for its germination, establishment, and growth. Mulch depth depends on the size of the particles; coarse mulch might need to be 3 to 6 inches deep to control all weeds, while a finer mulch might need to be only 2 to 3 inches deep. Plan to replenish landscape mulches periodically because of decomposition, movement, or settling. Organic mulches that have been on the soil for a while decomposing can provide an adequate growth medium for weeds to germinate and grow in. If crabgrass is germinating in the mulch, move it about with a rake to reduce seedling establishment. Hand pull escaped crabgrass plants before they set seed. Flaming with a hand-held burner will control crabgrass seedlings, but be careful not to set fire to the mulch if it is wood chips, compost, or another flammable material. Solarization Soil solarization with clear plastic prior to planting is effective for eradicating crabgrass plants and seed if you apply it during periods of high solar radiation. For more information about this process, see Pest Notes: Soil Solarization for Gardens & Landscapes . Chemical Control Crabgrass is easy to control in both turfgrass and ornamental beds if you apply preemergent herbicides before it germinates or postemergent herbicides after it germinates. Avoid using chemical herbicides in vegetable gardens because of the variety of crops grown and planted there. Read the label to make sure the product is safe to use on your turf type and around the ornamentals in your landscape. The active ingredients listed below can be found under different brand names; for a partial list, see Table 3 .\tTable 3.

Will injure cool-season species.\nPreemergent herbicides Preemergent herbicides available for home gardeners for crabgrass control in warm-season grasses (bermudagrass and zoysiagrass) and cool-season grasses (Kentucky bluegrass, fine fescue, tall fescue, and perennial ryegrass) include benefin, bensulide, pendimethalin, and trifluralin. Professional pesticide applicators also can use dithiopyr, oxadiazon, and prodiamine. Oryzalin also is available for home gardeners, but it is for use in warm-season turf (bermudagrass and zoysiagrass) only. Apply preemergent herbicides before crabgrass germinates, usually around the first of March. Many fertilizers contain a preemergent herbicide (weed and feed) so that the spring fertilization and preemergent treatments can be done at the same time. However, timing is critical, and weed and feed products often are applied at the wrong time. Crabgrass has germinated as early as Jan. 30 in Bakersfield and Fresno on warm days. If a preemergent were applied at that time it could start to breakdown in 4 to 5 months, and a second application could be required. Follow label directions during application and make sure there is adequate overlap, as the herbicide is applied in the lawn to prevent strips of weeds from coming up. Postemergent herbicides There are few postemergent herbicides available for crabgrass control in lawns. Dithiopyr currently can be applied to home lawns but only by professional applicators. Dithiopyr provides good preemergent control of seeds and controls emerged crabgrass plants up to the third leaf stage. Quinclorac often is sold in a ready-to-use spray bottle for the homeowner; however, crabgrass control is only partial, and some species have shown resistance to this product. Companies have stopped making products containing the active ingredients MSMA and DSMA, which have been used since the 1950s, and some companies are substituting quinclorac. Use postemergent herbicides when crabgrass is small (in the 1- to 3-leaf stage). If the crabgrass is larger, it takes more herbicide to control it, and there is a greater chance of injury to the turfgrass. Herbicides for ornamentals In ornamental beds, home gardeners can use the preemergent herbicides benefin, oryzalin, and trifluralin to control crabgrass. Landscape professionals also can use oxadiazon, pendimethalin, and prodiamine. You can use these chemicals either before crabgrass has germinated or after you’ve removed the weed by hoeing or hand pulling but before another flush of germination. Use a postemergent selective herbicide (fluazifop, quinclorac, or sethoxydim plus oil) to control crabgrass over or around most broadleaved ornamentals. You also can use nonselective herbicides such as glufosinate-ammonium, glyphosate, or pelargonic acid. Use nonselective herbicides with care to prevent them from harming desirable shrubs. All of these herbicides are available for use for home gardeners.",

It is a weedy summer annual species that is abundant throughout the world, invading vegetable gardens, bare areas, low-maintenance lawns, ornamental plantings, and agricultural areas. It was first identified in the United States in 1672 in Massachusetts. It is particularly well adapted to the warm, moist conditions found in California’s irrigated agricultural and ornamental sites. Common purslane is edible, with a sweet, yet acidlike flavor. An excellent crunchy salad plant, it is said to blend well with hotter-flavored salad herbs. It has been cultivated in India and the Middle East and has been popular in Europe since the Middle Ages. In the United States, common purslane is a minor crop because of its use in ethnic cooking and its reputed health benefits of bioprotective nutrients (antioxidants, vitamins, and amino acids). In Spanish it is known as verdolaga. Other members of the purslane family include moss rose, miner’s lettuce, and redmaids (desert rockpurslane).",

    "damagePestNote": "Because of its ability to produce large numbers of seeds, common purslane can rapidly colonize any warm, moist site. A few scattered plants in the first year can become an almost solid carpet of purslane the following year. Its ability to reroot after cultivation or hoeing frequently enables it to survive these cultural control practices. Common purslane is low in stature and forms dense mats. These vegetative mats utilize available moisture and nutrients and screen out light to the soil surface, preventing emergence of other seedlings. Common purslane is unsightly, reducing the esthetic value of turf and ornamental plantings. In commercial situations common purslane can limit summer vegetable production and reduce the efficiency of harvesting nut crops, such as almonds and walnuts, from the orchard floor.",
    "managementPestNote": "The primary method of management for common purslane is prevention. Common purslane is such a prolific seeder that once it has become established it is difficult to control. Avoid bringing common purslane into uninfested areas. Use weed-free planting stock and seed. Clean mowers, planters, and cultivation equipment that have been used in infested areas before allowing them to enter clean areas. Monitor uninfested sites for common purslane seedlings and destroy them before they set new seed. In home landscapes and gardens, this weed is generally managed by cultural means such as hand-weeding and mulching. Cultural Control Cultivation following irrigation when common purslane seedlings are small can reduce the weed population. However, because common purslane germinates at or near the soil surface, cultivation can bring up a fresh supply of weed seeds from deeper regions of the soil for future germination. Carefully monitor for weed seedlings after each irrigation and cultivate while seedlings are still small. When cultivating or hoeing larger common purslane plants, either remove them or allow plant material to thoroughly dry before irrigation. This will prevent rerooting of the fleshy stem sections. Otherwise, cultivation or hoeing becomes a transplanting operation and little control is achieved. Also, seeds may continue to ripen a week later even after a plant is pulled. If they screen out all light, mulches can be used to control common purslane in ornamental plantings, orchards, vineyards, vegetable crops, and gardens. To be effective, organic mulches should be at least 3 inches thick. Synthetic mulches (plastic or fabric mulch) which screen out light and provide a physical barrier to seedling development, also work well. Fabric mulches, which are porous and allow flow of water and air to roots, are preferred over plastics. Combinations of synthetic mulches with organic or rock mulches on top are commonly used in ornamental plantings. Soil solarization, the practice of covering moist soil with a clear plastic sheet for 4 to 6 weeks during the summer months, can kill common purslane and its seed. Solarization is done before gardens and ornamental areas are planted. To be effective it should be done during the summer months of July to August when heat and light intensity are highest. Prepare your beds before solarization. Do not disturb the soil or cultivate after solarization as weed seeds from deeper layers of the soil may be brought to the surface for germination. (See Soil Solarization: A Nonpesticidal Method for Controlling Diseases, Nematodes, and Weeds.) Biological Control Purslane sawfly is an insect that feeds and reproduces on common purslane. It eats the leaves of common purslane, leaving the plants low in vigor and with little photosynthetic area. Unfortunately, by the time it develops sufficient numbers to have an impact on the common purslane population, seed development and much of the damage from purslane competition in the garden or crop have already occurred. Chemical Control Chemical control is generally not necessary for the control of common purslane in the home landscape; it is primarily used in conjunction with cultural methods for commercial situations and should be reserved for use only under unusual circumstances in the home landscape. There are many herbicides that will control common purslane. Preemergent chemicals control seeds and postemergent chemicals control the growing weeds. A selective herbicide controls only certain weeds while a nonselective herbicide controls all or most weeds. If preemergent herbicides are to be used, make sure they are present at the soil surface during the time of seedling emergence and have been activated with an irrigation or a shallow incorporation soon after application. Tilling the preemergent herbicides too deeply (2–3 inches) into the soil has resulted in failure to control common purslane. Postemergent herbicides are effective when applied to the seedling stage; if applied too late in the season to mature plants, control is often erratic and seed set may have already occurred. Turfgrass Common purslane is usually not a problem in healthy, well-established turfgrass. It can be found most commonly in weaker, poorly maintained turfgrass. Therefore, the improvement of cultural practices to obtain healthy, competitive turfgrass is the best method to deal with this weed problem in lawns. However, several herbicides are available for use in turf that control purslane. Preemergent control The herbicides dithiopyr, pendimethalin, or combinations of benefin and trifluralin or benefin and oryzalin (used in bermudagrass turf only) will control common purslane as preemergent treatments. These products are mostly granular materials and some may be mixed with a turf fertilizer. Postemergent control Dicamba, MCPP, MSMA, and 2,4-D are effective postemergent herbicides in turfgrass and are available to the home gardener. Ornamental Plantings The use of a suitable mulch thick enough to limit the light reaching the soil surface can control common purslane in ornamental plantings and may eliminate the need for herbicides. Spot spraying a nonselective postemergent herbicide such as glyphosate can provide good control if care is taken to avoid letting it contact the foliage of desirable plants. Herbicide active ingredients such as oryzalin, pendimethalin, and trifluralin will provide control and are available to the home gardener. Vegetable Crops Soil solarization, mulches, and early cultivation of common purslane seedlings can help to control infestations. Preemergents are almost never used in the vegetable garden because of the diversity of different vegetables, chemical residues for months after the application, and chemical registrations on the labels. Specific herbicide recommendations for commercial orchard crops and vegetable plantings are available online; see the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines . Important Notes: If you decide to use a chemical you need to be aware of certain precautions.\tMany of the postemergent selective materials are in combinations to control a wider spectrum of weeds, often with three or four chemicals in the combination. Sometimes one or two of the chemicals will not control purslane but are included in the mix to control other weeds. For example, Bayer Advanced All in One spray contains 2,4-D, MCPP, dicamba, and MSMA. The MSMA provides no control and the MCPP provide partial control, while the 2,4-D and dicamba will control purslane.\tThe granular formulations (postemergent) with fertilizer are applied to a moist lawn so the herbicide is able to adhere to the moist broadleaf weed. Generally these “weed and feed” products are not recommended because the proper time for fertilizing often does not coincide with proper time for weed control.\tThere are many different brand names for many of the same chemical active ingredients, and/or variations in combinations of chemicals. Below are some examples:\tDithiopyr is found in Schultz Supreme Green Crabgrass Preventer with fertilizer, Best Turf Supreme Crabgrass Preventer plus Lawn Fertilizer, and Monterey Crab and Spurge Preventer.\tTrifluralin sold as Trifluralin, Treflan is available only to professionals, or in the nursery as Preen for home-owners.\tMecoprop (MCPP) is found in Bayer Advance All in One and Ortho Weed B Gon (with other chemicals).\tGlyphosate is sold as Roundup and Remuda.\nDrift on breezy days during application can move the chemical onto desired ornamentals and cause injury.\tImproper weed identification may result in no control or only partial control.\tCalibration of application equipment, especially with the preemergent herbicides, is critical. Too little chemical applied results in poor control, and too much chemical applied may result in injury to the turf or ornamentals. ",

It is tolerant of soils compacted by trampling with foot traffic and is therefore frequently found along paths and walkways.

    "damagePestNote": "Common knotweed readily invades areas where other weeds may have difficulty surviving such as trampled and compacted areas. Examples include turf, roadsides, sports fields, vacant lots, gravel parking areas, gardens, agricultural crops, foot paths, and dirt roadways. It is particularly troublesome in alfalfa fields, where soil is compacted from wheel traffic. In turf it invades open areas caused by heavy wear. It is a host for the parasitic weed dodder and some disease organisms such as powdery mildew fungi. Predatory (beneficial) insects are attracted to the flowers which they use as a food source.",
    "managementPestNote": "One of the most important management methods is to prevent soil compaction, which provides the conditions under which this weed grows best. Arrange landscapes so that soil is less likely to become compacted. Spread out foot and vehicle traffic over a broader area. Use fences or hedges to reduce traffic and install rock or pavement pathways where traffic cannot be avoided. Do not trample areas soon after irrigation or rainfall. Arrange soccer fields and athletic areas so that heavily used areas such as goals, midfields, and sidelines can be rotated. Aeration\tLoosening the soil in lawns to provide better drainage and a better environment for more desirable species can be beneficial. If areas are compacted, loosen the soil and overseed with a locally adapted grass seed. Mulches A variety of mulches can be applied to planting beds and other landscaped areas to prevent establishment of common knotweed. Mulching with landscape fabrics can be effective if the fabric is overlapped and no light is allowed to penetrate to the soil. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or black polyethylene (plastic tarp) to block all plant growth. Rock or organic mulches such as bark or compost can be used over the top of synthetic fabrics. If used alone, organic mulches should be 3 to 4 inches thick. Finer mulch material is not desirable since weeds seed may easily grow in it. Coarser material will drain readily and reduce seedling establishment of common knotweed. Mulch needs to be replenished each year to maintain cover thickness and eliminate light penetration to the soil. Prevent knotweed from producing seed by controlling young plants. This will reduce the amount of seed present in the soil in succeeding years. Cultivation Common knotweed is easy to remove with common weeding tools, such as a swivel hoe. For the home gardener, frequent manual removal along with mulching should be sufficient to manage this weed in most situations. Herbicides There are many herbicides that will control common knotweed, but they are not generally required in home garden situations. The selection of the herbicide is governed by the site and, should there be one, the crop. Remember that many of these herbicides can have negative effects on desirable plants as well and should be used with care, especially in a landscape situation. Preemergent herbicides must be applied before the knotweed seed germinates. Examples of preemergent herbicides available for home use include products containing benefin, dithiopyr, oryzalin, pendimethalin, prodiamine, and trifluralin. The following additional preemergent herbicides are only available to licensed pest control operators: atrazine, hexazinone, napropamide, oxadiazon, pronamide, and simazine. Postemergent herbicides like those containing dicamba (for use in turfgrass only), glyphosate, and pelargonic acid will control emerged common knotweed. For best results, these herbicides must be used while the weed is young, preferably the early seedling stage, before it becomes more established and hardened off. When knotweed is young (i.e., less than 3 inches in diameter), it can be controlled with 2,4-D, and there are a number of products available for home use that contain this chemical. Some postemergent herbicides kill the top growth of a plant, but it may regrow from buds on the crown of the plant.",

It is most prolific during the cooler times of the year, but can be found year-round near the coast or in shady areas. Although common groundsel grows best in moist fertile soil, it can grow in more trying environments such as along roadsides and other disturbed sites. It is also one of the major weeds in nurseries. It is a competitive plant in landscaped areas and gardens, but it is generally not a problem in lawns. In addition to the general weediness of this plant, it also can cause chronic liver poisoning to horses, cattle, and swine, even if only a small amount is eaten over a few weeks' time. The success of common groundsel as a weed lies in its seeds. It starts developing seeds very early in its life cycle and can produce 25,000 or more seeds per plant under optimal conditions, although about 1,700 seeds per plant are more likely. These seeds are easily spread by wind. Additionally, there can be three or more generations per year. Even when the plant is pulled from the ground or cut down, seeds from open flowers can still mature and germinate. This weed was also one of the first to have populations develop resistance to some common agricultural herbicides.",

Common groundsel plants that emerge after the crop is established are not effective competitors and have less of an impact. The most harmful consequence of the weed is liver poisoning of livestock. It is important to control common groundsel in and around areas where livestock may graze.",
    "managementPestNote": "Common groundsel is best controlled by eliminating the plant before it flowers. Since seeds can still mature even if the plant itself is killed, it is imperative to remove the plant from the area if there is any evidence of flowering. Seeds of common groundsel are not long-lived, usually remaining viable for about one year. Therefore, controlling this weed before flowering will have a great impact on the size of the next year's population. Shallow tilling or hoeing of young plants effectively controls common groundsel. Start monitoring for seedlings in early fall and remove seedlings and plants as soon as possible. Monitoring should continue through early summer. Even if all the weeds in your garden are controlled, common groundsel may still infest the area from seeds that are blown in from nearby sites. Cultural and Mechanical Control In most situations, common groundsel is easily controlled by hand removal or cutting the plant off at its taproot by hoeing. Monitoring the area on a regular basis and removing the weed throughout the growing season will greatly reduce the impact of the weed the next year. In larger areas, rototilling of young plants is effective. Mowing can be effective if the blade is set as close to the ground as possible. Mulches are very effective for controlling common groundsel. Seedlings cannot push through a 3-inch-deep layer of mulch. Blown-in seeds cannot establish on mulch if the surface is allowed to dry out. The key to control when using mulches is to choose a mulch size that is large enough to allow water to pass through and the mulch surface to dry out. This is best accomplished by using coarse mulch, usually sold as medium size. Fine mulch such as sawdust and potting compost will absorb water and actually become a suitable site for the common groundsel seeds to establish. Using mulch that has large pieces is also not recommended because these types will have too much space between the pieces. Seeds can drop to the soil underneath and grow up between the spaces. Synthetic mulches, such as landscape fabrics, provide a physical barrier to seedling development. However, these are only effective for controlling seeds that are already in the soil. They will not be effective in controlling seeds that have blown in during the current growing season. Biological Control The most promising method of biological control is the use of the rust fungus Puccinia lagenophorae. This fungus provided about 30% control in greenhouse tests. Research is being conducted to find ways to improve its efficacy. There are no insects that are effective for controlling common groundsel. Chemical Control Common groundsel in the home garden and landscape is best controlled using cultural and mechanical methods. If these methods cannot be used, herbicides containing diquat or glyphosate will control growing plants in home landscape beds. Only glyphosate can be used around edible crops and it will severely injure or kill any plant it touches. The sprayer tip should be shielded so that the spray does not contact any desirable plants, as either of these herbicides will injure many ornamental plants. There are no preemergent (before the plant emerges from the soil) chemical controls available for home use that are effective for controlling common groundsel.",

Turfgrass growing in soil that is low in nitrogen may receive supplemental nitrogen from old clover plants as their roots die and decay.",
    "damagePestNote": "Clover can be a concern in turfgrass or landscaped areas for at least three reasons. First, during the flowering period bees are attracted to the clover blooms and people playing or using the turfgrass may be stung. Second, clovers reduce the uniformity of the turfgrass because its texture, color, and growth rate are different from that of grasses. And third, the mature burs of burclover are a problem for people walking barefoot and when they become attached to clothing or pets.",
    "managementPestNote": "Clovers are relatively easy to control in the home garden by hand-pulling, cultivation, and the application of mulch. In large, landscaped areas herbicides may also be necessary. Because clover seed has a hard seed coat that is very heat tolerant, composting and solarization are not as effective in reducing clover’s seed viability as they are with other weed species. The hard seed coat also allows the seeds to survive longer in the soil than many other weed seeds; clover seeds can germinate over many years, making the control of these plants an ongoing effort. Once clovers are controlled, change cultural practices in the landscape and turfgrass to reduce the chance of reinfestation. Insuring a thick stand of grass can help exclude clovers in turf. Fertilization can also influence clover growth. For instance, adjust the fertilizer program to include more nitrogen and less phosphorus in turfgrass. Mulches can be effective in excluding clovers and other weeds in landscapes. Landscaped Areas Annual clovers can be easily controlled by hand-pulling, hoeing, or cultivation. Mulching, depending on the size and depth of the mulch, can prevent seedling establishment. Before seeds germinate, a 4-inch thick organic mulch (e.g., compost, wood chips, etc.) can prevent establishment of clovers. Organic mulch can also be applied after the seedlings have germinated but must be applied in a thicker layer (4 to 6 inches) and must cover the plants completely to block out all light. Organic mulches need to be reapplied each year to maintain the 4-inch-thick layer because they decompose and the thickness of the mulch declines over time. Woven black landscape fabric can exclude weeds over a number of years. Larger plants are more difficult to control with mulching, but they can be hand-pulled or hoed. Preemergent Control Preemergent herbicides available for landscape use are effective but generally unnecessary in the home landscape where annual clovers are easily controlled by the methods mentioned. For landscape professionals, herbicide formulations that contain isoxaben are effective for controlling annual clovers and can be used around many woody shrubs and trees. Most established annual flowers tolerate this herbicide. Herbicide formulations containing oryzalin, trifluralin, or pendimethalin will control most grass species and some broadleaf weeds but will miss many other broadleaf species (mustard, aster, legume, and cheeseweed families). Postemergent Control Postemergent control of clover is difficult. If the seedlings are small, glyphosate can be used in open areas provided desirable plants are not sprayed. Once annual clover plants reach 3 to 4 inches in height, control with herbicides is more difficult. The top may be burned, but the plants often regrow. None of the herbicides used in turfgrass for clover control is safe to use in ornamental plantings because they can damage desirable plants. Perennial clovers can also be controlled with glyphosate when the plants are seedlings, but once the clover is established, it cannot be controlled except by digging it out. Glyphosate at high rates will suppress some clovers. Turfgrass Areas Yellow turf and green clover is a good indication of low nitrogen fertility. The invasion of clover into turfgrass can be reduced by using levels of nitrogen fertilizer that will promote grass growth but not the growth of clover; this can be achieved by applying 1 pound of active nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of turfgrass during each month of active turfgrass growth (not to exceed 4 lb active nitrogen/1,000 sq ft/year). Also, high phosphorus in the soil promotes the invasion of clovers. However, nitrogen applications should be carefully calculated and applied to avoid runoff of excess fertilizer to municipal drainage systems. Clover in established turfgrass cannot be controlled by fertilization or mowing of the grass. Once clover is established, the annual clovers can be controlled by hand-pulling before seeds are formed. Hand-pulling will need to be repeated as new germination occurs and desirable turfgrass is planted in weeded areas. Herbicide Both established annual and perennial clovers can be controlled with postemergent herbicides. The best herbicide to use depends upon the species of turfgrass. Warm-season turfgrasses such as bermudagrass, zoysiagrass, and kikuyugrass will tolerate products containing mecoprop and dicamba but not triclopyr. Cool-season turfgrasses will tolerate all of the herbicides that control clover. The herbicide 2,4-D is not effective for clover control; it will injure the plant but does not control it.",

Seeds can germinate (sprout) soon after they disperse from the plant and require no further ripening as do seeds of many other weeds.",
    "damagePestNote": "When growing without competition from other plants, common chickweed can produce approximately 800 seeds and it takes 7 to 8 years for the seed bank (supply of viable seeds in soil) to be 95% depleted, ensuring an infestation for many years. Because of its ability to produce large numbers of seeds under cool temperatures, common chickweed rapidly colonizes any cool, moist area before winter or spring crops can become competitive. In commercial situations common chickweed can limit winter vegetable production by competing for space, light, and nitrogen. Additionally, common chickweed can serve as a host for insect pests such as lygus bugs and thrips as well as a reservoir host for tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV) and cucumber mosaic virus (CMV). In turf and landscape plantings, common and sticky chickweed can be unsightly, reducing the aesthetic value. In cool, wet conditions common chickweed forms a dense mat of spreading stems that may root at the nodes. This increases the difficulty of hand weeding or hoeing.",
    "managementPestNote": "Home gardeners should rely primarily on nonchemical control methods such as hand weeding, cultivation, mulches, and solarization when possible. Herbicides should only be used where the weed covers a very large area or where nonchemical weed management methods are difficult to adapt to the site. The likelihood of crop injury or application to plants that are not on the herbicide label is very high due to the wide variety of plants grown by home gardeners. Chickweed should be controlled before it flowers. This can be difficult due to the short period between germination and flower production. However, regular monitoring and removal of plants from the site will prevent seeds from developing and accumulating in the soil (seed bank). It is important not to only remove the plants from the ground but also remove them from the site; common chickweed can reroot from stem nodes in moist areas. Cultural Control Cultivation, including hand weeding, will effectively control chickweed if done early. It is most effective if the soil is dry and plants are small. Cultivation when plants are large and soil is moist can lead to spread of the weed through re-rooting. Under this situation, the weeded debris should be removed. Chickweed germination decreases with depth of the seed. Turning the soil over can reduce seed germination, but may also bring other weed seeds closer to the surface. Monitor the soil surface for chickweed seedlings throughout late fall and winter and then remove them by shallow cultivation or by hand pulling. Solarization using clear plastic mulch is a method of heating the soil to temperatures lethal to seeds and other pests. It is an effective method for controlling many annual weeds including the chickweeds. If solarization is done in late summer and the soil is not disturbed, subsequent winter crops can develop a canopy and become more competitive before other winter weeds germinate. See Soil Solarization for details of soil solarization. Using an organic mulch such as wood chips, at least two inches deep, will reduce the amount of weed seeds germinating by limiting light and serving as a physical barrier. Synthetic mulches such as landscape fabrics may also be used. In landscaped areas, they should be covered with an additional layer of mulch (rock or bark) to reduce deterioration of the fabric by UV radiation. Vegetable gardens also can utilize black plastic, both as mulch into which seeds or transplants are placed and also between rows. In turf, the primary method of control is to maintain a thick vigorous lawn. This will prevent chickweed seedlings from getting established. Deep, infrequent irrigation also discourages chickweed infestations. Follow fertilization guidelines as recommended for a particular turf species and avoid overapplication of nitrogen. For more detailed fertilizing information see the online UC Guide to Healthy Lawns, or download Practical Lawn Fertilization. Biological Control Other than grazing by sheep and birds, there are no commercially available biocontrol agents for the chickweed species. Chemical Control In general, nonchemical controls are the safest method for weed control in home gardens and landscapes. When cultural control methods cannot be used, such as on very large areas, in weakly growing turf, or in professionally managed landscapes, herbicides may be an alternative. However, they must be applied at a time when they are most effective for controlling chickweeds and in a way that prevents injury to desired plants. In both vegetable gardens and landscaped areas, mulches, cultivation, and hand weeding would be preferred. For professional landscapers, an herbicide can be helpful as a preemergent treatment when transplanting annuals for fall color or in woody perennial beds where mulches are not used. Preemergent products Preemergent herbicides must be applied before weed seeds germinate. Therefore, they are most effective if applied in late fall or early winter. It is important to follow the label directions regarding application method. Always check to see if the material should be mixed into the soil or not and whether the soil can be disturbed after application. Some products can only be used in ornamental areas or turf and must not be applied to areas where food crops will be grown. The label will also contain that information. Postemergent products Postemergent herbicides are applied to weeds after they have emerged from the soil. These are most effective when applied to weed seedlings. Postemergent products will injure any plant that is susceptible, including desired plants. Products containing diquat, glyphosate, or glufosinate are nonselective postemergent herbicides; they will injure most plants they encounter and should not be used near desired plants. Other postemergent herbicides listed in Table 1 are selective against broadleaf species and generally will not injure most grasses. This makes them useful materials in turf lawns, but they should not be used in landscape beds unless the desired plants can be protected from the spray. Products containing triclopyr will injure warm-season grasses like bermudagrass and kikuyugrass, but are safe to use in cool-season grasses like fescue. As with the preemergent herbicides, information regarding plant safety and appropriate use of the herbicide can be found on the product label. Table 1 lists the active ingredient in herbicides that provided good control of chickweed in field tests and can be found in products sold for nonprofessional landscape and garden use.\tTable 1.

    "damagePestNote": "Bedstraw is a troublesome agricultural weed as well as an important weed problem in landscapes and home gardens. In agricultural situations, it can reduce yields of cereals by 30 to 60% and become tangled in harvest and tillage equipment; its seeds are extremely difficult to remove from harvested grain, vegetable seeds, and oilseed crops. Bedstraw also can host several nematode, insect, and disease pests. The weed also impacts animal agriculture, as its seed or vegetative material can contaminate and reduce the value of wool or fur. If livestock ingest bedstraw forage, it can reduce their productivity, since the weed can inflame the animal’s digestive tract or act as a diuretic. In landscapes and home gardens, bedstraw competes for nutrients, water, and light with desirable plants. Aside from competition, bedstraw can reduce aesthetic quality of the landscape and can be a serious nuisance in some cases by smothering desirable vegetation and causing physical injury to small plants. It makes the harvesting of fruits and vegetables difficult, as the tangled stems weave throughout the garden. For pet owners, bedstraw seed or vegetation often gets caught in the fur of pets and can be difficult to remove.\tHERBAL VALUE\tHistorically, catchweed bedstraw has had several beneficial uses. The roasted seeds make a good coffee substitute (coffee also is a member of the Madder family), and the young leaves can be used as a substitute for tea or steamed with butter and eaten.\tAs an herbal remedy, it is said to be a diuretic, an anti-inflammatory, and an antispasmodic and was used to treat psoriasis and eczema.\tThe name itself, bedstraw, comes from use of the plant as a mattress filling; the clinging characteristic of the prickly plants minimizes matting and compaction of the mattress filling.\tA filter made of bedstraw leaves and stems has been used to strain cow‘s hair out of milk, and the plant also has been used as feed for geese and other birds. The roots can be used to make a red dye. ",
    "managementPestNote": "Cultural Control Long-term control of catchweed bedstraw in home landscapes relies on removing existing plants before they flower and produce viable seed. Hand hoeing or weed pulling can be very effective, especially in the early spring when soil is damp. Installing and maintaining mulch (e.g. bark, wood chips, leaf litter, gravel, weed tarps, etc.) can reduce seedling emergence and eases the removal of plants that do become established. Cutting catchweed bedstraw to 2 to 3 inches usually is not effective and has been reported to actually increase biomass production up to 30% compared to uncut plants. The growth of bedstraw can be suppressed by sowing a competitive crop such as a grass and wildflower mixture in some parks or other nonagricultural areas. Biological Control No insects or other biological agents are known to control catchweed bedstraw. Although some insects might feed on the plant, bedstraw does not cause enough economic loss to agriculture to warrant the search of a biological control agent. Chemical Control Preemergent herbicides containing the active ingredient oryzalin can provide fair control of bedstraw. Once established, bedstraw can be controlled with several postemergent herbicides. Oxyfluorfen, glyphosate, quinclorac, diclobenil, or carfentrazone (available to professional applicators) can control small bedstraw plants, while products containing dicamba, 2,4-D, or MCPA can provide partial control. Organic clove oil-based herbicides such as Matratec or BurnOut will kill young plants if applied early in the season.",

    "damagePestNote": "Both burning and stinging nettle are aptly named. Their leaves and stems are covered with long, fine to bristly hairs that can irritate and blister skin when handled. When human skin comes into contact with a leaf or stem, it often rapidly develops reddish patches accompanied by itching and burning. Frequently, a prolonged tingling sensation may persist on the affected skin for more than 12 hours, even after visible symptoms have faded. The prickly hairs of both burning and stinging nettle consist of a minute tubelike structure that has a hard round bulb at the tip and a softer vessel at the base. This bulb breaks off after contact with skin and exposes a needlelike point. When the tip contacts and penetrates the skin, it puts pressure on the basal vessel and results in the needlelike injection of irritating substances under the skin. The contents of the structures are not fully known, but have been found to contain active concentrations of the neurotransmitter chemicals acetylcholine and histamine. Unlike poison oak, which causes a red, itchy, weepy reaction called allergic dermatitis in only a portion of the population, the nettles affect everyone equally. This is known as irritant dermatitis. Along the coast, burning nettle is particularly problematic because it grows year-round. Stinging nettle plants can become a nuisance for farmers when large stands block irrigation waterways. Stinging nettle prefers moist areas in wildlands, such as areas surrounding creeks or rivers. If these sites occur along hiking trails, plants can be a nuisance or even a health hazard to visitors.",
    "managementPestNote": "Burning and stinging nettles growing in the home garden and landscape are best controlled using cultural and mechanical methods. Cultural and Mechanical Control Burning and stinging nettles can be controlled by removing plants by hand. However, it is important to wear gloves to protect skin from the stinging hairs. For stinging nettle, ensure that the underground portion called rhizomes are removed or the plants will regrow. Because stinging nettles are native to California and the western United States, control should only be performed in areas where they cause economic or health problems. Close mowing can prevent the development of fruit. Be aware that cultivating the soil may spread the rhizomes of stinging nettle, thus increasing the size of the population. Repeated cultivation works best as a control for this weed. Chemical Control Herbicides listed to control burning and stinging nettles include isoxaben, oxadiazon and oxyfluorfen, but these materials are available only to licensed pesticide applicators. Refer to the herbicide label for proper use of these products.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "The two primary methods for managing brooms are mechanical removal and treatment with herbicides. Broom establishment is mainly through seed dispersal, so maintaining a healthy cover of desirable vegetation and reducing soil disturbance will minimize the potential of broom invasion. Mechanical Control You can use hand pulling or mechanical grubbing—using a shovel, pick, or Weed Wrench—to physically remove smaller infestations in wildlands or urban areas. Remove plants in early spring or late fall when the soil is moist and it is easy to dislodge roots. Some tools, however, are difficult to use in soils that are too moist, and hand pulling can create soil disturbance that can lead to rapid reinvasion. Grubbing when the soil is dry and hard usually will break off the stems, leaving rootstalks that will vigorously resprout. Other forms of mechanical control have not proven successful. Brush rakes and bulldozers often leave pieces of rootstalks that readily can resprout. In some cases, brush removal in late summer, when plants experience moisture stress, can slow their ability to recover. However, using large equipment to clear land creates a perfect environment for new seedling establishment, making follow-up control essential. Mowing broom plants gives poor control, unless you perform it repeatedly throughout the growing season. Within a couple months of germination, young plants usually have produced underground rootstalks large enough to recover from a single mowing. Use extreme caution when mowing during spring and summer because of the potential for wildfires. Mowing later in the season also can spread seeds. Lopping mature plants near the base will provide some control; you’ll want to do this when plants are moisture stressed in late summer or in late spring following a winter with little rainfall. Lopping at other times can lead to vigorous resprouting. Cultural Control Burning alone is not an effective method for controlling brooms. Although burning can remove large amounts of debris, in many cases it can increase the population as it removes competitive vegetation, releases nutrients into the soil, and stimulates the germination of broom seeds left in the soil. Cutting the above-ground vegetation of French or Scotch broom and allowing it to dry on site, followed by burning, can effectively control resprouting. Burning is more effective if you follow it with an herbicide application, subsequent burnings, and/or revegetation using desirable species. It is important to employ a control strategy following a burn, otherwise the broom population in subsequent years may become worse than before. Grazing can provide control in small areas if the grazing pressure is high enough to continually suppress growth. Goats have been shown to vigorously feed on resprouting vegetation and shrubs, including brooms. You can train goats to selectively feed on brooms or other undesirable species, but overgrazing can lead to nonselective damage to desirable vegetation. Biological Control In the 1960s, three insects were introduced as biological control agents on brooms—the Scotch broom seed beetle (Bruchidius villosus), the Scotch broom seed weevil (Apion fuscirostre), and the Scotch broom twig miner moth (Leucoptera spartifoliella). The latter two species are specific to Scotch broom, while the seed beetle also attacks Portuguese broom, Spanish broom, and French broom. Because brooms are serious problems in many countries, the International Broom Initiative is evaluating other insects and pathogens in their native countries to determine their control potential. Chemical Control California homeowners can purchase the post-emergent herbicides triclopyr and glyphosate, the most effective chemicals for controlling brooms. You can use these herbicides either alone or as a combination of glyphosate with triclopyr or imazapyr. In areas near rivers or streams, it is important to use the proper formulation of these herbicides. Ester formulations of triclopyr or imazapyr, for example, are not registered for use near water, and some glyphosate formulations cannot be used near water either. Depending on the compound, you can apply these herbicides as foliar sprays, a cut-stump treatment, or a basal bark application. When using herbicides, be sure to prevent them from getting on desirable plants. Because glyphosate is a nonselective compound, it will damage or kill other vegetation. Triclopyr is a broadleaf herbicide that will not injure grasses but will damage or kill other broadleaf plants. Homeowners and professional applicators should wear appropriate protective equipment as stated on the herbicide label. Foliar Sprays The effectiveness of herbicides depends on three factors—timing, achieving good coverage, and using a proper concentration. Timing Foliar application of herbicides to brooms is most effective after leaves are fully developed and when the plant is actively growing. This period normally is from April into June or July, when soil moisture remains adequate. The flowering stage is the optimum time to treat. Don’t apply herbicides before plants begin their spring growth or in mid-summer when plants are stressed. Although not typically a problem, dust can cover plants growing near roadsides. Herbicides, particularly glyphosate, can readily attach to dust or soil particles, thus reducing their effectiveness. Coverage and Concentration You can apply herbicides as a foliar spray using one of two methods. The first is spray-to-wet, where all leaves and stems should glisten following an application. Coverage, however, should not be to the point of runoff. The other method is a low-volume foliar application called drizzle. This technique uses a higher concentration of herbicide, but you spray it at a lower volume. This method is advantageous in dense shrubbery or where access is limited. To achieve proper coverage, spray the herbicide uniformly over the entire canopy in a “drizzle” pattern, using a spray gun. For spray-to-wet applications, products containing 41% glyphosate as the active ingredient can provide good to excellent control of brooms when applied at 2.5 ounces of product per gallon of water (2% of the total solution). Some products available for use in the home landscape with this concentration of active ingredient are Clearout 41 Plus, Honcho Herbicide, and Honcho Plus Herbicide. Glyphosate products that have a lower concentration of active ingredient, such as Roundup Concentrate (18% active ingredient), will require about 6 ounces of product per gallon of water (4.7% of the total solution) for effective control. Triclopyr is available in either amine or ester formulations, with triclopyr ester being more effective on brooms, since absorption of the herbicide into the foliage is not as good with the amine form. One product available for use by licensed applicators—and for homeowners that acquire an operator identification number from their county Department of Agriculture—is Garlon 4. This and other similar products formulated with a minimum of 61% active ingredient can provide good to excellent control when applied at 1 to 1.25 ounces of product per gallon of water (0.75% to 1.5% of the total solution). Mixing triclopyr ester with commercially available seed oils can offer better penetration. One available product is Hasten Spray Adjuvant; mix this at 1.25 ounces of product per gallon of herbicide solution (1% of the total solution). The best time to apply either form of the herbicide is late spring. When air temperatures are higher than 80°F, it is better to use the amine formulation, because the ester form is subject to vaporization. More than one ester formulation of triclopyr is available, with differing degrees of volatilization at high temperatures. You can use glyphosate and triclopyr in combination to achieve better control. Triclopyr is also available in retail stores for use in the home landscape in products formulated at a lower concentration than those available to licensed applicators. Carefully read and follow the label of these products—such as Brush-B-Gon Poison Ivy and Poison Oak & Brush Killer—to apply the correct amount. The drizzle application method is good in situations of dense planting or when it is difficult to cover an entire area due to topography. Glyphosate formulated into a product with 41% active ingredient can provide good to excellent control of brooms when applied at 19 ounces of product per gallon of water (15% of the total solution). You also can apply triclopyr using a drizzle application. If you are using triclopyr ester formulated into a product with 61% active ingredient, apply it using 13 ounces of product (10% of the total solution) and 25 ounces of seed oil (20% of the total solution) per gallon of water. Remember that although the drizzle technique uses a higher concentration of herbicide, you are applying it at a lower volume. One gallon of mixed herbicide solution should adequately treat one-half acre of densely populated broom. Cut Stump Application Cut stump treatments are most effective in spring during active plant growth or in the fall. Immediately after cutting, apply the herbicide to the cut surface with a paint brush, spray bottle, or plastic squeeze bottle. Delaying application will result in poor control, because the cut surface quickly will develop an air interface between the water in the vascular tissue and the herbicide solution, preventing movement of the chemical into the plant. For small stumps, completely cover the cut surface. For large stumps, it is necessary to wet only the cambium, the outer ring of wood next to and including the bark. For small-stemmed shrubs, cut the stems with loppers or clippers and paint or sponge the herbicide solution onto each cut end. For triclopyr products containing 61% active ingredient, use 1 part product and 4 parts water. The 8% material available to homeowners in nurseries and other stores will work well undiluted. You also can apply glyphosate as a cut-stump application. If using a brand that has 18% glyphosate listed in the active ingredients, make a 1:1 solution of the product and water. If the product contains 41% glyphosate, use 1 part product and 3 parts water. Basal Application You can apply concentrated forms of triclopyr ester to basal regions of brooms using a backpack sprayer with a solid cone, flat fan nozzle, straight-stream spray nozzle, or even a wick applicator. Thoroughly cover a 6- to 12-inch high basal section of the stem with spray but not to the point of runoff. You can make basal bark applications almost any time of the year, even after leaves have senesced. For triclopyr ester formulated into a product with 61% active ingredient, the application ratio is 13 ounces of product (10% of the total solution) and 25 ounces of seed oil (20% of the total solution) per gallon of water. Glyphosate and the amine formulation of triclopyr provide poor control using this technique. One application of an herbicide does not always completely control brooms. Retreat when new, sprouting leaves are fully expanded, generally when the plants are about 2 feet tall. Watch treated areas closely for at least a year, and retreat as necessary.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Bermudagrass is not an easy weed to control, especially when it must be controlled selectively within an already planted turf, garden, or landscaped area. It can be managed nonchemically with a persistent program of removal, or over large areas by cultivation and by withholding water during the summer to desiccate the stolons and rhizomes. Mulches of black plastic or geotextile landscape fabric can also be effective over large areas if light is excluded. Control with herbicides requires careful timing and often more than one application. Cultural Control Although bermudagrass tolerates some drought, it grows best when irrigated. If the area where the bermudagrass is growing can be dried in summer without injuring any nearby ornamentals, withhold water to dry the stems and rototill or spade the area two or three times during summer months. This will bring rhizomes to the surface where they dry out. Raking to remove rhizomes and stolons will also help. If water is applied during the process or it happens to rain, the remaining bermudagrass will regrow. A single, deep (down to 6 inches) cultivation may be adequate to bring the majority of shoots to the surface, but the time required to dry the remaining rhizomes still buried in the soil will add additional weeks to months. Be careful not to cultivate bermudagrass if the soil is moist or the weed will spread, because cultivation chops the stems into segments and each segment becomes a new plant. While cultivating and drying can effectively kill established plants and rhizomes, they do not kill seeds in the soil. Bermudagrass growth can be reduced by increasing shade from trees and tall shrubs. Shaded growth will be fine and spindly; plants are easier to remove than those growing in full sun. Shade from short shrubs or ground covers will not be effective; the bermudagrass will simply grow up through these plants. Because bermudagrass spreads vegetatively and by seed, it can be spread by clippings from mowing. If lawn clippings are to be used in the landscape, compost them thoroughly to kill seed and vegetative structures and reduce the spread of this weed. Mulching and Solarization Mulch can be used in a variety of ways to manage bermudagrass. Black polyethylene applied over bermudagrass to prevent sunlight from reaching the plant can effectively control established plants. Mow and irrigate the grass, place the plastic over the plants, and leave it for at least 6 to 8 weeks in summer. Placing plastic over bermudagrass in winter will not control it. Be sure that the plastic remains intact without holes, or bermudagrass will grow through the holes and survive. If ornamentals are planted in holes in the plastic, bermudagrass control is reduced. Clear plastic mulching (solarization) is effective for eradication of bermudagrass plants and seed if it is applied during periods of high solar radiation. In California’s Central Valley, this means during June to August, whereas in coastal areas the best time may be August to September or May to June when fog or wind is most likely to be at a minimum. Before applying the plastic, closely mow the bermudagrass, remove the clippings, and water the area well. It is not necessary to cultivate before solarization, but a shallow cultivation may improve control. Place clear, ultraviolet (UV) protected polyethylene over the area. The plastic should extend roughly 2 feet beyond the bermudagrass stolons to make sure the infested area is covered; it must be maintained intact for 4 to 6 weeks. Shade will reduce the effectiveness of solarization because it limits the amount of radiation. Solarization works most effectively when there is no slope in the land or if there is, the slope has a south or southwest exposure. Temperatures are not as high under plastic placed on a north-facing slope; consequently control is not as effective. After solarization, do not cultivate the area deeper than 3 inches to avoid bringing weed seed into the upper soil layer. (See the soil solarization publication). Mulching with products such as wood chips is not effective against bermudagrass because the weed can push up this mulch. If organic landscape (geotextile) fabrics are used under the mulch, however, control can be achieved. The fabric must be overlapped so the stolons do not grow between the fabric sheets. If holes or gaps are present in the fabric, control will be reduced because bermudagrass is likely to grow through the holes. Chemical Control of Established Plants Bermudagrass can be controlled in ornamental landscapes and turf with postemergent herbicides. Postemergent herbicides are applied to actively growing bermudagrass foliage and stems during spring and summer. The best time to apply a particular postemergent herbicide depends on the type of herbicide and the situation where the weedy bermudagrass is growing. There are two basic types of herbicides that can kill mature bermudagrass, nonselective herbicides that kill most plant species and grass-selective herbicides that only kill plants in the grass family (Poaceae). In addition, there are some herbicides that will suppress bermudagrass, which might give a desirable turf species a chance to outcompete the weed. Grass-Selective Herbicides These herbicides include the active ingredient sethoxydim (Grass Getter), fluazifop (Fusilade, Ornamec, and Grass-B-Gon), or clethodim (Envoy). Fusilade and Envoy are only available for sale to licensed pesticide applicators, the others are sold in most retail garden outlets. This is not a complete list of all retail products; look for similar herbicides with the same active ingredient. Early spring is the best time to apply a grass-selective herbicide. For best control with these herbicides, make the first application in spring when new bermudagrass growth is less than 6 inches in length, then re-apply the herbicide before the regrowth reaches 6 inches again. Additional applications on regrowth may be needed through the spring and summer. It is important to be consistent with treating regrowth in order to eliminate the weed, but read the label of each product for information on the total amount that can be used per year per area. The best control is achieved when the bermudagrass is growing vigorously, has lots of leaf surface and is not drought stressed, is not dusty, and has not been damaged by insects. Treating Around Ornamentals and in Turf. These herbicides can be used safely around most, but not all, ornamental trees, shrubs, and flowers. The product use labels include lists of ornamental plants that can be injured by these herbicides. Do not use these herbicides near ornamental grasses. The herbicide Fusilade can be used to kill bermudagrass in fescue turf when label conditions are followed. Nonselective Herbicides Glyphosate (Roundup and other brand names) is a nonselective herbicide that kills plants by translocating down into the root system, in addition to killing top-growth. For glyphosate to be most effective it must be applied to bermudagrass that is vigorously growing, not drought stressed, and has lots of leaf surface (do not mow the weed for 2 to 3 weeks before treating). The best time of the year to apply glyphosate is during late summer when the plant is storing food in the roots. Wait 7 days after applying to mow or cultivate the bermudagrass. Cultivation will bring the underground parts of the plant (stolons and rhizomes) to the surface of the soil so they can dry. If left uncultivated, deeper rhizomes and roots may survive the first application and regrow. Other Herbicides Some herbicides will suppress bermudagrass by killing green stems and leaves. Suppressing bermudagrass will not typically eliminate it permanently from an area, because there is no effect on the rhizome system, but it might be enough to foster the growth of a desirable turf species. Rigorous, repeated suppression may eliminate the weed if combined with control of bermudagrass seedlings. Herbicides that can suppress bermudagrass include nonselective contact herbicides such as diquat (sold mostly in formulation with other herbicides), pelargonic acid (Scythe), other fatty or weak acids, and glufosinate (Finale). These herbicides can be used in ornamental and turf situations, but they will also injure desirable vegetation that they contact. Triclopyr (Weed-B-Gon and Turflon) is a selective herbicide that kills broadleaf plants, but will suppress bermudagrass in cool season turfgrasses. Controlling Bermudagrass Seed Following the treatment of a stand of established bermudagrass, bermudagrass seed that is present in the soil can still be a problem. Bermudagrass seed will not be controlled with any of the previously mentioned treatments except solarization. Treating Around Ornamentals If bermudagrass seeds germinate in areas around ornamental plantings, the seedlings can be controlled with shallow cultivation, hoeing, or a thin layer of mulch. Treating Turfgrass Bermudagrass seedlings may emerge in turfgrass that has been treated with postemergent herbicides because postemergent herbicides do not control the seed. On recently planted or established cool-season turfgrass, herbicides can be used to selectively control germinating bermudagrass seed without injuring the turfgrass. Apply a product containing siduron at the time of planting the turfgrass; DCPA (available to licensed pesticide applicators only), trifluralin (Treflan), pendimethalin (Halts, Pendulum), or oryzalin (Surflan) can be used when the turfgrass is greening. Dithiopyr (Dimension) and prodiamine (Barricade, which is available to licensed pesticide applicators only) can be used in established turf. To effectively control new seedlings, apply these herbicides before the seeds germinate. Because bermudagrass seed is viable in the soil for 2 years, apply the herbicide each year for 2 years. Do not use preemergent herbicides, except those containing siduron, just before seeding or sodding a new lawn because they also affect germination of the desired grass species.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Annual bluegrass, Poa annua, is one of the most common weeds of residential and commercial turfgrass, ornamental plantings, and gardens in the United States. It is native to Europe but is distributed worldwide. Commonly referred to as “Poa,” it is a particular problem in golf course greens and fairways, but it can also be a troublesome weed in vegetable and agronomic crops grown in cool climates. Though present in tree and vine crops in California, it usually isn’t a significant problem. The genus Poa consists of about 200 species worldwide. Their typical boat-shaped leaf tips, which curve up like the bow of a boat, are a distinguishing characteristic of the genus. Three members of the genus Poa are commonly found in turfgrass sites in California. Kentucky bluegrass, P. pratensis, is a common cool-season turf species that is well adapted to cool, well-watered sites such as coastal and intermountain areas. Rough bluegrass, P. trivialis, is a less desirable turf species that does well in moist, shaded areas but lacks heat and drought tolerance, so it is short-lived and is generally considered a weed. Annual bluegrass is a weed species that, unlike Kentucky and rough bluegrass, is able to survive low mowing heights of less than 1 inch and still reseed. A fourth species, bulbose bluegrass, P. bulbosus, is sometimes found as a weed in Northern California turfgrass.",

    "damagePestNote": "Annual bluegrass can be a major weed problem in home lawns and is a continual nuisance for turf and landscape managers. Because it is a grass weed growing in turfgrass, selectively removing it is very challenging. In turf it forms a weak sod that provides poor footing for athletic fields and golf courses. In addition, unsightly seed heads of annual bluegrass reduce the aesthetic quality of the turf and disrupt the smooth rolling surface of putting greens. Because of its winter growth habit, it is more competitive than warm-season turf cultivars (e.g., common and hybrid bermudagrass, buffalograss, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass) during the cool season. This accounts for the severity of annual bluegrass invasions during winter. Although annual bluegrass can be a problem in all turf species, it visually blends into many cool-season turf species (e.g., Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, and perennial ryegrass) and is most obvious in closely mowed species, such as bentgrass and bermudagrass, especially the dwarf hybrids. In cool seasons, annual bluegrass grows faster than warm-season turf cultivars, which gives infested turf an undulating or irregular surface in as little as two days after mowing. When annual bluegrass infests ornamental plantings, it forms a dense mat that lowers the vigor of desirable landscape plants by reducing available nutrients in the soil surface. In established woody shrubs and trees, annual bluegrass probably has little detrimental effect but can be aesthetically distracting. Once a few annual bluegrass plants become established in turf or ornamental areas, spread can be rapid because of its prolific and rapid seed production. Mowing, foot traffic, birds, and cultivation all spread seed.",
    "managementPestNote": "A primary method of control is preventing new infestations. Maintenance gardeners frequently spread weeds from site to site when weed seeds contaminate mowers, string trimmers, and aerifiers. Cleaning landscape equipment after use in infested sites can help prevent annual bluegrass from spreading to uninfested areas. If solitary plants of annual bluegrass are found, they should be removed before seed production starts. Isolate small areas of infestation until control can be accomplished. Hand pulling or hoeing to remove annual bluegrass can be effective as long as it is done frequently. Because dense seedling infestations are common, open areas where old plants have been removed will often have new flushes of seedling plants, hence the need for frequent attention. Controlling annual bluegrass infestations manually is very expensive in commercially maintained landscapes and usually not practical or successful. However, it can be very appropriate for home gardeners. Maintaining turf and ornamental areas properly assures their maximum vigor, which helps these plantings become as competitive as possible and slows invasion of the weed. A dense sward of turf and closely spaced ornamentals shade the soil surface and make the establishment of annual bluegrass seedlings more difficult. Turfgrass No single control procedure has been successful in controlling annual bluegrass in turfgrass. Early removal of solitary infestations has been successful when practiced diligently. Open spots should be overseeded to establish a vigorous turfgrass. Removal of grass clippings might help reduce the number of seeds that reach the soil. Overwatering, especially in shady areas, will predispose turfgrass to annual bluegrass invasion. Use deep and infrequent irrigation to discourage the development of shallow-rooted annual bluegrass. Try withholding water until the desirable turf is beginning to show drought stress, rather than keeping the surface moist. Avoid fertilization and don’t aerate turf during the peak of annual bluegrass germination. Also, avoid cultural practices as well as use patterns that tend to promote soil compaction. Preemergent herbicides such as benefin, bensulide, dithiopyr, oryzalin, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, and prodiamine and their combinations such as benefin/oryzalin have been very successful in limiting germination of annual bluegrass. They should be applied a few weeks before weed seeds germinate to be most effective, as they have no effect on emerged plants (Table 1). Ethofumesate and pronamide are also available for preemergent use and have some postemergent activity on both varieties of Poa annua, but these herbicides can’t be used in all turf species. Although most of these products may be used on residential lawns, some of the products aren’t available for homeowner purchase and can be applied only by commercial applicators. To limit bluegrass germination during winter, apply preemergent herbicides in late summer or early fall when soil temperatures drop below 70°F. Where the perennial type is a large component of the bluegrass population, preemergent herbicides will be of little or no benefit. There are a few relatively new postemergent herbicides that control annual bluegrass, and none of them can be used in all turf species. They are usually applied to warm-season turfgrass species. These herbicides can be used on residential lawns by licensed or certified applicators, but they have been of little benefit when used as the sole method of control. Foramsulfuron, sulfosulfuron, and trifloxysulfuron can be used only on warm-season turfgrass species. Ethofumesate can be used in dormant bermudagrass, creeping bentgrass, Kentucky bluegrass, tall fescue, perennial ryegrass, and St. Augustine to reduce annual bluegrass infestations. Pronamide can be used in warm-season turfgrass for established annual bluegrass, but it is slow acting (15 to 21 days). Annual bluegrass infestations often become so severe in commercial turfgrass that complete renovation is necessary. This can be done by spraying the entire area with a nonselective herbicide such as glyphosate followed by replanting with a desirable turf species. Planting and establishment of the new turfgrass should take place during late spring and summer so that a solid cover of new turf can be obtained before the annual bluegrass germination period. Choose a species and variety that will compete well with bluegrass. Then preemergent herbicides can be used in late summer or fall to further limit annual bluegrass from establishing.\tTable 1.

Preventing germination and seeding is very important. Hand removal or spot spraying of solitary plants will save time and money in the long run. Cultivation or hand hoeing, although possible under some circumstances, generally isn’t useful unless continued throughout the germination period because seed that is buried in the soil is brought to the surface where it germinates. Mulching with landscape fabrics can be effective if the fabric is overlapped so no light is allowed to reach the soil. Use a polypropylene or polyester fabric or use a black polyethylene (plastic tarp) to block all plant growth. Plant-derived products (i.e., organic mulches) or rock can be used over the top of the synthetic fabrics. When used alone, plant-derived products should be 2 to 3 inches thick, depending on the coarseness of the mulch. Finer materials can be less thick than coarser ones. If seeds of annual bluegrass get into the mulch, they can germinate and establish, just as if they were in soil. In these cases annual bluegrass plants can be easily removed by hand or with a hoe. Mulch thickness will need to be replenished periodically to maintain cover and eliminate light penetration to the soil. Preemergent herbicides such as dithiopyr, oryzalin, oxadiazon, pendimethalin, prodiamine, and trifluralin or a combination such as benefin/oryzalin, benefin/trifluralin, or pendimethalin/dimethenamid can be used to limit seedling germination in sites where use of these materials is permitted (Table 1). Some of these products may be available only to commercial applicators. Make the application before seeds germinate in fall when soil temperatures go below 70°F. Preemergent herbicides will be of little benefit if established annual bluegrass plants or the perennial type of bluegrass is already present. However, if the existing bluegrass is removed, a preemergent herbicide can be applied to control seedlings that germinate later. Few postemergent herbicides are registered for use in established ornamental plantings. Clethodim, fluazifop, and sethoxydim are selective for grass weeds and safe on broadleaf ornamentals, but only clethodim has any effect on annual bluegrass. Spot treatment with diquat, glufosinate, glyphosate, nonanoic acid, or other nonselective herbicides can reduce annual bluegrass populations in ornamental beds, but extreme care is needed to prevent herbicide spray or drift onto desirable plants, or the herbicides will injure the plants. Clethodim and glufosinate are available only to licensed applicators at this time.",

    "damagePestNote": "Decay fungi destroy cell wall components; including cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, that make up the woody portion of a tree. Depending on the organism, decay fungi can destroy the living (sapwood) or the central core (heartwood) part of the tree. Decay isn't always visible on the outside of the tree, except where the bark has been cut or injured, when a cavity is present, or when rot fungi produce reproductive structures. Wood decay can make trees hazardous, as infected trunks and limbs become unable to support their own weight and fall, especially when stressed by wind, heavy rain, or other conditions. Decay can also be hidden, affecting wood strength without any outward sign of its presence. Decay fungi typically reduce the weight of wood by growing through the vascular tissues and degrading some or all major cell wall components and absorbing breakdown products of cellulose or hemicellulose. A 10% loss of wood weight can result in 70 to 90% loss in wood strength. Many branches that fall from trees appear sound, but upon analysis, they were colonized by wood decay organisms. Table 1 lists several wood decay fungi found on California trees and symptoms and signs commonly associated with each organism.\nHow to remove a branch or limb\tRemove a branch by making the pruning cut just outside the branch bark ridge and branch collar, as indicated by number 3. When removing a limb larger than about 2 inches in diameter, make three cuts in the order indicated. Make the first cut from below, about one-third of the way through the limb and 1 or 2 feet from the trunk. Make the second cut about 2 inches beyond the first cut, cutting from above until the limb drops. Make the final cut at number 3. ",
    "managementPestNote": "Wood decay is usually a disease of old trees. While difficult to manage, several factors can reduce its impact. Protect trees from injuries and provide proper cultural care to keep them vigorous. Prune young trees properly to promote sound structure and minimize the need to remove large limbs from older trees, which creates large wounds. Large wounds provide greater surface area and exposure to heartwood for potential colonization by decay organisms. Remove dead or diseased limbs. Make pruning cuts properly. Prune just outside the branch bark ridge, leaving a uniform collar of cambial tissue around cuts on the trunk to facilitate wound closure. Avoid leaving stubs (branch protrusions that will eventually die) that provide an infection opportunity due to wound closure failure. Proper pruning cuts are circular, not oval, and not flush to the main stem (which damages the branch bark collar or ridge). Wound dressings are not recommended as they do not hasten wound closure or prevent decay and, in some cases, may hasten the development of decay behind the dressing. Tree failures can cause personal injury, property damage, or both. Trees near structures or other high-value potential targets should be regularly inspected by a qualified expert for signs of wood decay and other structural weakness. Hazardous trees should be assessed by a qualified arborist who can recommend mitigation, including appropriate pruning or cultural practices. Depending on the extent of decay and the structural weakness, tree removal may be necessary.\tTable 1. Wood Decay Fungi on California Landscape Trees.\nFungus\tCommon hosts\tSymptoms\nArmillaria mellea oak root fungus\nMany coniferous and broadleaved woody species; peach, fig (F. carica) and Peruvian pepper are highly susceptible hosts.\tOne of the most widespread plant pathogens in California. Causes a white butt and root rot. When bark is removed, white or cream-colored mycelial plaques —the vegetative part of fungi—are present between the bark and wood of roots and trunk near or slightly above the soil line. Mushrooms can form at the base of affected trees following fall and winter rains. Fungi enter susceptible plants by means of dark, rootlike structures called rhizomorphs found on the surface of affected roots. Fungal growth is most rapid under warm and wet conditions; decay has been slowed or stopped in some instances by removing soil from around the base of the tree and allowing areas to dry.\nGanoderma applanatum\tartist's conk\nWide variety of landscape and forest trees including acacia, alder, ash, birch, carob, citrus, elm, eucalyptus, fir, magnolia, maple, mulberry, oak, Peruvian pepper tree, pine, poplar, sweet gum, sycamore, tulip tree, and willow.\tThe fungus invades trees through wounds, kills the sapwood of some species, and causes white rot of the sapwood and heartwood in roots and trunks. Forms semicircular conks that are 2–30 inches wide and 1–8 inches thick. Upper surface of conk is brown, and the lower surface is white, but turns dark when scratched, hence the common name “artist’s conk.” Stalks are absent. Fungus can spread through natural root grafting. Conks usually are found near ground level. Columns of decaying wood can extend as far as 15 feet above and below the conk.\nGanoderma polychromum (formerly G. lucidum) varnish fungus\nAcacia, apple, ash, birch, boxwood, cherry, citrus, elm, hackberry, sweet gum, black locust, honey locust, magnolia, maple, oak, olive, peach, Peruvian pepper tree, pine, poplar, redbud, spruce, and willow.\tThe fungus causes a white rot and can attack living trees, causing extensive decay of roots and the trunk. Can kill the host during a period of 3–5 years. On some trees, such as oaks and maples, the rate of decay is rapid. The red-brown, annual conks are up to 14 inches wide and coated on top with a distinctive reddish varnish-like crust; they generally appear at base of the trunk during summer. Causes decline in hardwood trees. Environmental stress, such as drought and wounding, can predispose trees to infection from this fungus.\nLaetiporus gilbertsonii\tL. conifericola sulfur fungus\nAcacia, ash, beech, birch, cherry, chestnut, elm, eucalyptus, fir, hackberry, black locust, honey locust, maple, oak, pepper tree, pine, poplar, spruce, tulip tree, walnut, and yew.\tThe fungus causes a brown heart rot of living trees but also will decay dead trees. It is one of the few brown rot fungi of hardwood trees. It can enter trees through bark wounds and dead branch stubs. This fungus is one of the most serious causes of decay in oaks and eucalyptus, and one of the few fungi that cause decay in yew. The soft, fleshy, moist conks range from 2 inches to over 20 inches wide and are bright orange yellow above and red yellow below. Conks are produced annually and appear singly or in clusters, usually in fall; they become hard, brittle, and white with age. Conks do not appear until many years after the onset of decay and indicate extensive internal damage.\nPleurotus ostreatus oyster mushroom\nAcacia, alder, ash, beech, birch, chestnut, elm, eucalyptus, fir, hackberry, holly, horse chestnut, linden, magnolia, maple, oak, olive, pecan, persimmon, poplar, spruce, tulip tree, walnut, and willow.\tThis fungus decays heartwood and sapwood, causing a white, flaky rot. Infections occur through open wounds, and decay is most extreme when wounds are large. A cluster of shelf-like mushrooms, each 2–8 inches wide, is produced annually and can indicate localized decay or heart rot that extends 10 feet in either direction. The mushrooms are smooth on the upper surface with gills that characteristically extend down along the stalk on the lower surface.\nSchizophyllum commune common split gill fungus\nMore than 75 species of landscape trees including acacia, ash, birch, camphor, elm, eucalyptus, fir, juniper, laurel, locust, magnolia, oak, oleander, pepper tree, pine, plane tree, poplar, sequoia, spruce, sweet gum, tulip tree, walnut, and willow.\tThis fungus causes a white rot of sapwood and produces annual fruiting bodies that are hairy and white to pale brown when young but darken with age. The stalkless brackets are tough, leathery, about 1–4 inches wide, and usually found in clusters. The pale gills on the underside have the appearance of being longitudinally split, hence the common name. The fungus colonizes trees stressed by heat, sunburn, drought, or major wounds. It generally fruits on cut and fallen wood and dead parts of living trees.\nStereum species parchment fungus\nAcacia, alder, birch, catalpa, cherry, chestnut, elm, eucalyptus, fir, juniper, magnolia, maple, oak, pine, sequoia, spruce, sweet gum, tulip tree, and willow.\tThis group of fungi are commonly found on dead trees, branches, and stumps but rarely cause serious decay in living trees. They can cause heart rot on trees wounded by pruning or bark injury. The annual fruiting bodies are thin, leathery, and bracket-like, lack stalks, and are 1 inch or more across. The upper surface is gray brown, and the lower side is buff to brown and smooth, lacking tubes or pores.\nTrametes hirsuta hairy turkey tail fungus\nAlder, ash, birch, catalpa, cherry, chestnut, citrus, elm, eucalyptus, fir, ginkgo, holly, juniper, locust, magnolia, maple, oak, pine, poplar, redbud, spruce, sweet gum, sycamore, tulip tree, walnut, and willow.\tThis fungus, which causes white rot, can enter a tree through dead wood exposed by fire scarring; decay begins as a sap rot and can continue as a heart rot on some woody species. It often produces fruiting bodies on the dead portions of live hardwoods; fruiting bodies are tough, leathery, usually stalkless, shelf-like, and 1–10 inches wide. The outer surface is dry, velvety, and has concentric zones. The under surface is poroid.\nTrametes versicolor turkey tail fungus\nAlder, apple, ash, beech, birch, catalpa, cherry, chestnut, crape myrtle, elm, eucalyptus, fir, gingko, hackberry, holly, juniper, laurel, lilac, linden, locust, London plane tree, maple, nectarine, oak, pepper tree, poplar, redbud, sweet gum, tulip tree, walnut, and willow.\tThis fungus commonly is found on cut and fallen wood and on wounded areas of living trees; it also is capable of colonizing sapwood of trees and shrubs stressed by water shortage, sunburn, freeze damage, or wounding. The fungus, which causes a white, spongy rot of wood, can actively invade and rapidly kill the cambium (the tissue between the bark and wood), causing cankers with papery bark and dieback. The annual conks are thin, leathery, stalkless, bracketlike, 1–4 inches across, and often found in groups. The upper surface is velvety with concentric zones of various colors, and the lower surface is cream colored and minutely poroid.\nPhellinus\tigniarius and other Phellinus spp.\nAmerican sweetgum, apple, bay tree, birch, elm, cottonwood, locust, lilac, poplar, pear, walnut, oak, sycamore, willow.\tPhellinus produce perennial conks with a “hoof” like appearance—dark and cracked above and tan or ochre below, with small pores. A new hymenium or spore bearing layer is added each year. These are white rotting fungi that are common on various species of hardwoods and softwoods. These cause heart rots on intact trunks.\nBiscogniauxia mediterranea, B. atropunctata\nSycamore, oaks, maple, pecan, golden raintree, ash, walnut.\tBiscogniauxia is an Ascomycete fungus that resides in trees as a latent infection not causing symptoms. When trees are stressed by drought, the fungus invades the sapwood, decaying it extensively and cutting water supplies to the canopy. Fruiting bodies are long sheets of charcoal-like stroma that emerge through and from under the bark of affected hardwoods. Conidia proceed the dark charcoal sexual fruiting bodies.\nAnnulohypoxylon spp.\tCoast live oak, maple, alder, birch, apple, cottonwood, willow, elm, persimmon, mountain lilac.\tAnnulohypoxylon spp. are in the same group as Biscogniauxia but fruiting bodies form on the surface of bark in a concentric- or globe-shaped stroma. They only form on dead wood and indicate that the sap rot fungus has killed that portion of the standing tree. The young fruiting bodies are cream-colored and covered in asexual spores called conidia in early summer or late spring. These later darken into structures that contain the sexual ascospores.\nOxyporus latemarginatus\nVictorian box, coast live oak, maples, albizia, citrus, ash, locust, walnut, American sweetgum, magnolia, apple, cottonwood, peach, plum, apricot, willow, and elm.\tThis fungus produces its white poroid fruiting body covering the lower portions of trees sometimes spreading over soil around the root collar. It is annual and disappears a few weeks after its occurrence. It is a potent sap rot fungus that leads to extensive white rot, sometimes colonizing the entire trunk.\t",

    "damagePestNote": "Phytophthora ramorum affects different species in different ways. It can be lethal to trunk hosts and madrone (Arbutus menziesii) saplings, while it might cause only a minor leaf or needle disease for the numerous foliar hosts. Depending on a number of factors, some trees might never become infected, some might become infected and survive for various lengths of time, and others might become infected and die quickly. In a few, rare cases, trees have recovered on their own. Because Sudden oak death is a relatively new disease in California, it will take time to determine how likely different outcomes are for different tree species. Initial observations tell us that once infected, tanoak has a high probability of P. ramorum killing it, but some trees will survive. Coast live oaks appear to have a lower mortality rate than tanoaks, although the disease has killed many of them. There is little mortality information on California black oak at this time, so it is difficult to predict how this species will fare. Trees growing in a mixed woodland or forest environment seem more likely to become infected by P. ramorum, as it spreads naturally in forest settings along coastal California. Oaks in residential landscapes seem less likely to be infected with Sudden oak death, because they usually are not growing as close to foliar hosts such as California bay laurel. An exception would be when horticultural hosts such as rhododendrons and camellias are growing close to oak trunks.",
    "managementPestNote": "Once Sudden oak death infects oak trees, there is no known way to cure them. Therefore, most of the management practices discussed below are directed at preventing the spread of the disease to new plants or areas and protecting susceptible trees before they are infected. Inspecting Nursery Plants Before Making a Purchase Many common horticultural plants are hosts for P. ramorum, and nurseries in California, other states, and other countries have found the pathogen on their plants. Plants are shipped all across the country, but they are strictly regulated. All P. ramorum host plants in California’s regulated counties must be inspected and approved prior to shipment out of the regulated area, although sales within the regulated zone of 14 counties are not. In either case, carefully inspect the leaves of host plants for symptoms before making a purchase. Nurseries often use general fungicides that can mask P. ramorum symptoms, and some plants might have asymptomatic or latent infections that might not be visible at the time of purchase. Even if you do not see signs of infections when you make a purchase, consider quarantining the new plant in moist area of your yard for up to 8 weeks to see if symptoms manifest before you transplant it. You might want to refrain from planting any of these horticultural hosts near susceptible oaks in your yard. Removing Infected Oaks A tree with Sudden oak death needs to be considered and treated differently than a tree without the disease, but the disease alone is not justification for removal. In some cases, oak trees infected with the disease can remain relatively healthy for some time. Since data indicate nonoak foliar hosts actually spread the pathogen, removing infected oak trees probably will have little or no impact on local disease levels and spread. However, an important consideration with respect to any tree is whether it presents a hazard to life or property. All trees present some hazard, depending on the tree’s structural integrity and its potential to do harm should it die or portions of it break off. Preliminary research has shown that trees P. ramorum has infected or killed are prone to rapid decay and unpredictable failure. Green infected trees and trees already dead from P. ramorum and/or secondary pests are at an increased risk of trunk and limb breakage. The decision to remove a hazardous tree ultimately lies with the property owner. In order to get an objective assessment of hazardous conditions, contact a certified arborist or other qualified professional. While a dead tree has an increased risk of causing damage, consider leaving it standing if there is not a risk to life or property, such as when the tree is in a natural area. Standing dead trees provide important wildlife habitat, and after they fall and decay, they are a source of nutrients to be recycled into the soil. Always consult regulatory officials regarding local tree ordinances before deciding to remove trees. Experienced tree service technicians should conduct tree felling, as infected trees might have an abundance of structural wood decay. If there is an acute emergency, contact your city arborist or local fire or police department. Removing Nonoak Host Trees Large-scale removal of nonoak host plants is not a recommended way to prevent disease spread at a residential level. However, selective removal and/or pruning of these foliar hosts when they are in close proximity to uninfected, susceptible oaks might be helpful in preventing particular oaks from becoming infected, especially if there are few other disease hosts nearby. For more information, see Sudden Oak Death and Residential Oak Care: Protecting Trees in Advance of Local Disease Establishment. Disposing of Plant Debris Since P. ramorum has been present in many areas of coastal California for a decade or longer, complete eradication is impossible. However, the disease is not uniformly distributed, and there are still many areas that remain uninfested. If infested plant materials are moved, they inadvertently can transfer the pathogen to uninfested areas. Disposal of infested material is extremely important, because branches, twigs, and leaves from California bay laurel, rhododendron, and other host plants can harbor P. ramorum, even after they are removed from the plant. In infested areas, the best option is to leave infested material on site, chipping the small material for use as ground cover and using larger pieces for firewood. Since inoculum levels already are thought to be high in these infested areas, leaving the additional inoculum from the infested plant material on site will not significantly worsen local disease conditions. Composting also can successfully kill the pathogen, but the compost must reach temperatures that probably are not possible or practical in a home-composting site. Removing plant debris from the property is recommended only if it is the first infected tree detected in the area or if fire risk is high. If infected wood is removed from your property, make sure it is utilized or disposed of in a way that does not spread the disease. Avoid leaving wood next to roads where it could be picked up and transported off site by unauthorized parties. Regulations prohibit the movement of host plants and plant parts out of the quarantined area. If you have infected trees cut down, make sure the wood and other tree parts are not moved outside of the quarantine area. Sanitation Measures to Minimize Pathogen Spread As a precaution against spreading the pathogen, clean and disinfect pruning tools after use on confirmed or suspected infested trees or in known infested areas. Sanitize pruning tools before pruning healthy trees or working in a pathogen-free area. Clean vehicles and shoes of mud, dirt, leaves, and woody debris before leaving a P. ramorum- infested site and before entering a site with susceptible hosts. Replanting After Removing an Infected Tree If you want to replant, it is important to choose a tree that will suit your needs and adapt well to the site. There are many resources available that can guide you in making the right choice. Check to see if there are any local ordinances or guidelines that govern tree replacement or planting. Resistance to P. ramorum in oak trees is just beginning to be explored. Resistant planting stock is not available at this time nor is it known if it ever will be available. Coast live oaks do not seem to be infected by P. ramorum until they reach about 4 inches in diameter, so small, new trees should be immune for a number of years, and high value trees can be preventatively treated once they reach a susceptible size. (See Preventative Phosphonate Treatments below.) Species in the white oak group (e.g., valley oak, Garry oak, and blue oak) are not susceptible to P. ramorum . If you have space for replanting many trees, consider replanting the lost species in combination with other trees that do not get the disease. Then, if some trees succumb to P. ramorum there still will be others that survive. Preventative Phosphonate Treatments One phosphonate fungicide, Agri-Fos, is registered as a preventative treatment for P. ramorum for use on individual, high-value tanoak and oak trees. Treatment is not recommended in areas where infested plants are not already present. This treatment is not a cure, but it can help protect trees from infection and suppress disease progression in very early infections. The phosphonate compound can be injected or mixed with a surfactant and sprayed on the trunk for absorption through the bark. Booster treatments need to be made every 1 to 2 years. Since the treatment must be made to healthy trees and the pathogen’s distribution and activity is patchy and somewhat unpredictable, it is difficult to determine which trees need treatment. Generally, you should consider treating healthy, high-value oak or tanoak trees within 150 feet of other infested plants. You also might want to treat healthy, high-value oaks or tanoaks if they are surrounded by healthy California bay laurel and there are known infections within 150 to 1,000 feet. For more information, see Sudden Oak Death and Residential Oak Care: Protecting Trees in Advance of Local Disease Establishment . Insecticides Using insecticides to treat or prevent P. ramorum infections provides no control and is not justified. However, treating individual, high-value landscape trees displaying early bleeding symptoms of Sudden oak death might be justified to control damage from secondary bark beetle attacks. If using an insecticide, apply it only if the disease is not at an advanced stage and with the realization it might prolong the life of the tree only for a relatively short time. For more information, see Pest Notes: Bark Beetles .",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Sooty mold is the common name applied to several species of fungi that grow on honeydew secretions on plant parts and other surfaces. The fungi’s dark, threadlike growth (mycelium) gives plants or other substrates the appearance of being covered with a layer of soot. Sooty molds don’t infect plants but grow on surfaces where honeydew deposits accumulate. Honeydew is a sweet, sticky liquid that plant-sucking insects excrete as they ingest large quantities of sap from a plant. Because the insect can’t completely utilize all the nutrients in this large volume of fluid, it assimilates what it needs and excretes the rest as “honeydew.” Wherever honeydew lands—e.g., leaves, twigs, fruit, yard furniture, concrete, sidewalks, or statuary—sooty molds can become established. Although sooty molds don’t infect plants, they can indirectly damage the plant by coating the leaves to the point that it reduces or inhibits sunlight penetration. Without adequate sunlight, the plant’s ability to carry on photosynthesis is reduced, which can stunt plant growth. Coated leaves also might prematurely age (senesce) and die, causing premature leaf drop. Fruits or vegetables covered with sooty molds are edible. Simply remove the mold with a solution of mild soap and warm water. Fungi that most commonly cause sooty molds in garden and landscape situations are in the genera Capnodium, Fumago, and Scorias. Less common genera include Antennariella, Aureobasidium, and Limacinula . The species of sooty molds present are determined by a combination of the environment, host, and insect species present. Some sooty mold species are specific to particular plants or insects, while others might colonize many types of surfaces and use honeydew produced by several kinds of insects. A number of insects can produce the honeydew sooty molds need for growth. Their common characteristic is that they all suck sap from plants. The insects include aphids, leafhoppers, mealybugs, psyllids (including eucalyptus lerp psyllid), soft scales, and whiteflies . Both the immature and adult stages of these insects feed by sucking sap from plants, producing honeydew.",

    "managementPestNote": "Most plants will tolerate a small insect population and light amounts of sooty mold. When sooty molds are present on any surface in the landscape, it indicates there is, or has been, a sucking insect population present in the vicinity. Control of sooty molds begins with managing the insect creating the honeydew. For example, populations of aphids usually are highest on succulent, new growth. In some situations a strong stream of water can dislodge the insects. Also fertilize and water to keep plants healthy but not excessively vigorous. Another important consideration can be ant management. Ants are attracted to and use honeydew as a source of food. Because of this, they will protect honeydew-producing insects from predators and parasites in order to harvest the honeydew. In many cases, predators and parasites are sufficiently abundant and quickly begin feeding on and reducing populations of scale insects, aphids, psyllids, whiteflies, or mealybugs once ants have been eliminated. If populations fail to decline, apply horticultural oils, neem oil, or insecticidal soap to suppress the problem insects. One or more applications might be needed. For detailed information on managing these pests see the appropriate Pest Notes listed in References. Sometimes judicious pruning can be helpful in removing most of the infested plant parts. Also, keep ants out of trees and away from honeydew-producing insects by applying a sticky compound around the trunk and trimming limbs touching buildings or other access points. Baits, such as ant stakes placed under trees and shrubs, may help reduce ant foraging in some cases. More information on ant management can be found in Pest Notes: Ants . Once honeydew-producing insects are suppressed, sooty molds will gradually weather away. In some instances, if necessary, sooty molds can be washed off with a strong stream of water or soap and water. However, it can be difficult to remove sooty mold even with soap and water.\tTable 1.

    "descriptionPestNote": "A variety of plant pathogens (bacteria, fungi, and viruses) can attack roses and lead to diseases. The most common rose disease in California gardens and landscapes is powdery mildew, but other diseases including rust, black spot, botrytis, downy mildew, and anthracnose may cause problems where moist conditions prevail. In addition to diseases caused by plant pathogens, roses may display damage symptoms resulting from chemical toxicities, mineral deficiencies, or environmental problems. Such problems are termed abiotic disorders and improving environmental conditions can often correct these symptoms. This publication helps readers manage rose diseases and problems by offering an integrated approach which includes choosing varieties and irrigation practices carefully, promoting air circulation by pruning correctly and providing sufficient space between plants, and removing severely infested material promptly. Although some rose enthusiasts consider regular application of fungicides a necessary component of rose culture, many gardeners can grow plants with little to no use of fungicides, especially in California’s dry interior valleys. LEAF AND SHOOT DISEASES AND DISORDERS Fungal diseases Powdery mildew, caused by the fungus Podosphaera (previously Sphaerotheca) pannosa var. rosae, produces white-to-gray powdery growth on both sides of leaves, as well as shoots, sepals, buds, and occasionally on petals. Leaves may distort and drop. Powdery mildew does not require free water on plant surfaces to develop and can even infect roses during California’s warm, dry summers. Overhead sprinkling, such as irrigation or washing, during midday may limit the disease by disrupting the daily spore-release cycle, yet allows time for foliage to dry before evening. The pathogen requires living tissue to survive, so pruning, collecting, and disposing of leaves during the dormant season can limit infestations. However, these sanitation practices may not entirely eradicate powdery mildew since airborne spores from other locations can provide fresh inoculum. Rose varieties vary greatly in resistance to powdery mildew, with landscape (shrub) varieties among the most resistant. Glossy-foliaged varieties of hybrid teas and grandifloras often have good resistance to powdery mildew as well. Plants grown in sunny locations with good air circulation are less likely to have serious powdery mildew problems. Fungicides may be available, but generally you must apply them to prevent rather than eradicate infections, so timing is critical and repeat applications may be necessary. In addition to synthetic fungicides, other materials having fungicidal properties are available, including horticultural oils, neem oil, sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, and the biological fungicide Bacillus subtilis. Except for the oils, these fungicides are primarily preventive, although potassium bicarbonate has some eradicant activity. Oils work best as eradicants but also have some protectant activity. Do not apply oils to water-stressed plants or within two weeks of a sulfur spray. See the Pest Notes: Powdery Mildew on Ornamentals for more details on management. Downy mildew, caused by the oomycete Peronospora sparsa, requires a narrow range of temperature and humidity to thrive. Angular purple, red, or brown spots appear between veins on leaves, which then become yellow and drop. Sometimes, downy mildew may produce pale, felty patches of fruiting bodies on the undersides of leaves, helping to distinguish it from powdery mildew, which typically produces visible mycelial growth on both sides of leaves, as well as shoots and buds. Because downy mildew requires moist, humid conditions, it is most likely to cause problems in coastal areas of California and, during a narrow period of time in spring and fall, in the Central Valley. To reduce downy mildew, increase air circulation through pruning and avoid frequent overhead irrigation that results in prolonged periods of wet foliage. Downy mildew spores can survive on fallen leaves for weeks when humidity is high and temperatures are mild, so sanitation is essential if these conditions are present. These spores become dormant at relative humidity levels below about 80%, and are killed when exposed to temperatures greater than 85°F for several days. Control with fungicides is very difficult. Environmental management is much more likely to be effective. Rust, caused by the fungus Phragmidium mucronatum (formerly P. disciflorum), prefers cool, moist weather such as that found in coastal areas of California but may also be a problem inland during wet years. Infected leaves may drop prematurely, and exhibit small, orange pustules on the undersides, while the upper sides often discolor. Avoid overhead watering and prune back severely affected canes. During the winter, collect and dispose of any leaves remaining on the plants and those that have fallen off. Plants can tolerate low levels of damage without significant losses. You can use preventive applications of fungicides, but attempting to keep plants rust-free may require frequent applications, which may not be justifiable in garden or landscape situations. Black spot, caused by the fungus Diplocarpon rosae, produces black spots with feathery or fibrous margins on the upper surfaces of leaves and stems. Small, black fruiting bodies are often present in spots on the upper sides of leaves. No fungal growth occurs on the undersides. This fungus requires free water to reproduce and grows when leaves remain wet for more than seven hours. If washing plants, for example to reduce aphid numbers, do it in the morning or midday, so leaves have a chance to dry before evening. Provide good air circulation around plants. Remove fallen leaves and other infested material, and prune out infected stems during the dormant season. Black spot is usually not a problem in the interior of California, but may be present in humid, coastal areas. In general, miniature roses are more susceptible than other types, although a few varieties are reliably resistant to all strains of black spot. Oils, including neem oil, or other fungicides such as potassium bicarbonate and sulfur, have been shown to be effective in reducing black spot. If cultural controls prove to be inadequate, fungicides such as chlorothalonil may be preventative options for the next season. Anthracnose, caused by the fungus Elsinoe rosarum (formerly Sphaceloma\trosarum), results in leaf spots. When first formed, spots are red or sometimes brown to purple. Later the centers turn gray or white and have a dark red margin. Fruiting bodies may appear in the middle of the spot, and the lesion may fall out, creating a shot-hole appearance. Rose anthracnose spreads during extended wet weather when temperatures are moderate. Because these conditions are infrequent in California, it is not a common problem. However, it can be an issue where sprinkler irrigation is routine, so the use of soaker hoses or drip systems may prevent this disease. Sanitation and adequate spacing between plants also limit disease development. Hybrid teas and old-fashioned climbing and rambler roses are the most affected. Viral diseases Viruses and virus-like diseases occur wherever roses grow. For home gardeners, the problem is most often one of unsightly foliage, with possible decreased plant vigor and flowers that are smaller, fewer, or both. These viruses are most commonly spread during propagation through budding an infected scion onto a healthy rootstock or a healthy scion to an infected rootstock. Disease symptoms are not always obvious, which is why the use of virus-tested planting stock is advantageous. Pruning tools cannot spread rose viruses. Rose mosaic disease (RMD) is common wherever roses are grown and is named after the leaf symptoms. Ringspots, line patterns, mosaics, and distortion or puckering are typical. Leaf symptoms will vary depending on which virus or viruses are present, the rose cultivar, the time of year, and growing conditions. Visual symptoms also can be transient; for example, hot, bright days can cause the symptoms to appear milder or disappear. However, the virus remains, and the plant becomes a symptomless carrier. In the United States, RMD is the result of an infection with Prunus necrotic ringspot virus, Apple mosaic virus, or both. In other countries, Arabis mosaic virus also contributes to RMD. These viruses may be present alone or in combination, accounting in part for the array of symptoms observed on infected plants. An accurate diagnosis may require laboratory tests. As with many viruses, transmission occurs when virus-infected plant material is grafted onto healthy plant material. Experimental evidence indicates rose mosaic can spread via root grafts. RMD is controlled by removing infected plants and using virus-tested propagative material. Rose rosette disease (RRD) is a very destructive disease of roses east of the Rocky Mountains in the United States. Symptoms include excessive lateral shoot growth and thorniness, witches’ broom, leaf proliferation and malformation, mosaic, red pigmentation, and eventually death. Rose rosette disease was positively identified in two locations in Kern County, California, in 2018. RRD was first described in the 1940s, but the viral pathogen rose rosette virus was only recently identified. The virus has long been known to be transmitted by the eriophyid mite, Phyllocoptes fructiphilus . Multiflora rose, an invasive species in many areas, is highly susceptible to RRD and may serve as a source of inoculum. Plants suspected of RRD should be removed, including roots, and destroyed. Effective control of eriophyid mites can reduce the risk of spread, but is very difficult and impractical in most gardens and landscapes. Using clean plants is the best method of preventing the disease. Rose spring dwarf disease (RSD) has been found in California and other parts of the United States. RSD causes rosetting or a balled appearance in the new growth following budbreak. The leaves first emerging in the spring are recurved or very short and show conspicuous vein clearing or a netted appearance. These symptoms become less apparent as shoots eventually elongate. Canes may develop a zigzag pattern of growth as the season progresses. RSD is caused by infection with the virus Rose spring dwarf-associated virus . Transmission studies have identified rose-grass aphid and yellow rose aphid as vectors for this virus, which has a wide host range. RSD is controlled by removing infected plants and using virus-tested propagative material. Other viruses, such as Rose yellow vein virus, Rosa rugose leaf distortion virus, and Rose yellow mosaic virus, have been recently identified as a result of advances in diagnostic technologies. These viruses, in addition to previously identified viruses such as Blackberry chlorotic ringspot virus, Tobacco streak virus, Strawberry latent ringspot virus, Tomato ringspot virus, and Tobacco ringspot virus present problems to commercial rose growers. Rose gardeners, retailers, and regulatory officials don’t like the look of the symptoms. Cut flower producers may see a significant decrease in production, bloom quality, or both, depending on the variety of rose and type of virus. Nursery plant producers may face rejection of interstate shipments. Using clean planting stock is the best management practice to limit viruses in roses. Plant material that has been tested for and found free of viruses known to cause disease symptoms is referred to as clean stock. For the home rose grower, no effective method exists for eliminating rose viruses. Use of virus-indexed stock—plants that have tested negative for these viruses by laboratory and field methods—for field propagation is the recommended preventative practice for commercial producers. FLOWER PETAL AND BUD DISEASES AND DISORDERS Botrytis blight, caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, thrives under conditions of high humidity and cool temperatures. Affected plants have spotted flower petals and buds that fail to open, often with woolly, gray fungal spores on decaying tissue. Twigs die back, and large, diffuse, target-like splotches may form on canes. Decrease the humidity around plants by modifying irrigation and pruning techniques and reducing ground cover. Remove and dispose of fallen leaves and petals and prune out infested canes, buds, and flowers. Botrytis blight is a problem usually only during spring and fall in most of California and during summer along coastal areas when the climate is cool and foggy. Rose phyllody is a flower abnormality recognized for more than 200 years in which leaf-like structures replace flower organs. The fundamental cause seems to be changes in plant hormone balance, brought about by abiotic conditions such as environmental stress, or by living infectious agents. Some rose varieties such as floribundas are more likely to exhibit phyllody symptoms, probably due to genetic susceptibility. In fact, one floribunda ancestor is Rosa chinensis, from which came the “Green Rose,” a curious variety that has a stable mutation causing phyllody in all its flowers. Phytoplasmas and viruses can disrupt normal hormone production, inducing phyllody in many plant species, but play less important roles in rose phyllody. Although a few reports exist of rose phyllody caused by phytoplasmas, the association is poorly documented. Insects—most often leafhoppers—can spread these pathogens, so the appearance of phyllody often raises concerns about possible disease spread through the garden. In roses, the most common cause of phyllody is environmental stress, such as hot weather when flower buds are forming, or water stress. If environmental factors are the cause, affected plants usually have normal and abnormal flowers simultaneously but otherwise look healthy. When the weather cools, the bush resumes producing only normal flowers. Rose growers familiar with the characteristics of individual varieties can assess if phyllody is caused by disease or environmental stress by carefully examining plants. A lack of stunting or yellowing and good overall growth indicate a virus or phytoplasma is not likely the cause, but instead an individual flower is responding to specific environmental conditionals. No management practices are suggested other than pruning out individual blooms. CANE DISEASES AND DISORDERS Botrytis blight, as described above, can cause twig dieback and large, diffuse, target-like blotches on canes. Winter injury from cold temperatures results in dead or dying flowers, twigs, and stems. A thick layer of leaf mulch may protect roses during the winter in cold mountain areas. Stem canker diseases caused by pathogens that move into injured tissue may follow winter injury. It is important to provide proper care to keep plants vigorous to prevent problems. Prune out diseased or dead tissue, making cuts at an angle in healthy tissue just above a node, and avoid wounding canes. Cankers often develop after cold temperature injury, so early spring pruning may not effectively eliminate them if late frosts occur. Additional late spring pruning may be necessary. Sunburn appears as blackened areas, especially on the south and west sides of canes. Excessive heat from the sun or reflected heat from masonry, vinyl siding, or rock mulch on rose canes causes sunburn. Often, sunburn occurs as an indirect result of drought stress or spider mite pressure leading to defoliation. Crown gall, caused by the bacterium Agrobacterium\ttumefaciens, affects many woody plants including fruit trees, ornamentals, and roses as well as some herbaceous plants including chrysanthemums and daisies. Crown gall bacteria invade plant tissue after wounding. Galls, in the form of large, distorted tissue growth, can form at the base of the cane, on roots, or farther up on stems. Infected canes can be stunted and discolored. Do not plant susceptible plants in infested soil or near infected plants. Do not accept rose plants dug from someone’s yard that have crown gall symptoms. Purchase and plant only high-quality stock. ABIOTIC DISORDERS Nutrient deficiencies cause various symptoms such as interveinal chlorosis (yellowing), vein yellowing, tip and marginal necrosis, and premature leaf drop. Many California soils have low percentages of organic matter and the nitrogen reserve is typically low, so nitrogen must be added as organic or inorganic fertilizer. Micronutrient deficiencies, especially iron and zinc, appear as interveinal chlorosis of new leaves. These elements may be deficient because soils are too wet or too alkaline, or because the soil type, such as sandy loam, is low in micronutrient content. Because inorganic forms of iron and zinc form insoluble precipitates in alkaline soils, you can apply iron and zinc directly to foliage. You can apply iron and zinc in a chelated form to either soil or foliage. Nutrient excesses may limit rose growth if the total salt level becomes too high. A value of less than or equal to 2 dS/m (decisiemens per meter) is recommended. At a higher concentration of total salts, plants may show a lack of vigor and short shoots, although no definitive leaf symptoms may appear. If salt concentrations are found to be greater than 4 dS/m, you also may see browning of the leaves . A few nutrients cause specific toxicities. Boron, which is found at high levels in some California soils, will cause stunting of plants, chlorosis, and marginal browning of the newest leaves. A soil concentration of less than or equal to 1 part per million is recommended. To remediate a problem with high boron, soil must be leached. That is, good quality water (low in boron) is applied and moves down through the soil profile, dissolving boron and carrying it below the root zone. Herbicide damage may manifest itself in a variety of symptoms, which include cupped, curled, or yellowed leaves, small leaves, or death of the entire plant. The herbicide class and dosage to the plant determine which symptoms appear and their severity. Injury from glyphosate (e.g., Roundup) is relatively common. Damage symptoms from glyphosate may not appear during the application season, especially if the application occurred in autumn, but may appear the following spring as a proliferation of small shoots and leaves. The plant will outgrow the injury if the dosage was not too high.",

    "managementPestNote": "The best method of control is prevention. Planting resistant vegetable varieties when available, or avoiding the most susceptible varieties, planting in the full sun, and following good cultural practices will adequately control powdery mildew in many cases (Table 1). However, very susceptible vegetables such as cucurbits (cucumber, melons, squash, and pumpkins) may require fungicide treatment. Several least-toxic fungicides are available but must be applied no later than the first sign of disease. Resistant Varieties In some cases, varieties resistant to powdery mildew may be available. If available, plant resistant varieties of cantaloupe, cole crops, cucumber, melons, peas, pumpkins, and squash. If you plant more susceptible varieties, you may need to take control measures.\tTable 1.

A good alternative is to use a slow-release fertilizer. Overhead sprinkling may help reduce powdery mildew because spores are washed off the plant. However, overhead sprinklers are not usually recommended as a control method in vegetables because their use may contribute to other pest problems. Fungicide Application In some situations, especially in the production of susceptible cucurbits, fungicides may be needed. Fungicides function as protectants, eradicants, or both. A protectant fungicide prevents new infections from occurring whereas an eradicant can kill an existing infection. Apply protectant fungicides to highly susceptible plants before the disease appears. Use eradicants at the earliest signs of the disease. Once mildew growth is extensive, control with any fungicide becomes more difficult. The products listed here are for home garden use. Commercial growers should consult the UC Pest Management Guidelines. Fungicides Several least-toxic fungicides are available, including horticultural oils, neem oil, jojoba oil, sulfur, and the biological fungicide Serenade. With the exception of the oils, these materials are primarily preventive. Oils work best as eradicants but also have some protectant activity. Oils To eradicate mild to moderate powdery mildew infections, use a horticultural oil such as Saf-T-Side Spray Oil, Sunspray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil, or one of the plant-based oils such as neem oil or jojoba oil (e.g., E-rase). Be careful, however, to never apply an oil spray within 2 weeks of a sulfur spray or plants may be injured. Also, oils should never be applied when temperatures are above 90°F or to drought-stressed plants. Some plants may be more sensitive than others, however, and the interval required between sulfur and oil sprays may be even longer; always consult the fungicide label for any special precautions. Sulfur Sulfur products have been used to manage powdery mildew for centuries but are only effective when applied before disease symptoms appear. The best sulfur products to use for powdery mildew control in gardens are wettable sulfurs that are specially formulated with surfactants similar to those in dishwashing detergent (e.g., Safer Garden Fungicide) However, sulfur can be damaging to some squash and melon varieties. To avoid injuring any plant, do not apply sulfur when air temperature is near or over 90°F and do not apply it within 2 weeks of an oil spray . Other sulfur products, such as sulfur dust, are much more difficult to use, irritating to skin and eyes, and limited in terms of the plants they can safely be used on. Copper is also available to control powdery mildew but is not very effective. Biological Fungicides Biological fungicides (such as Serenade) are commercially available beneficial microorganisms formulated into a product that, when sprayed on the plant, destroys fungal pathogens. The active ingredient in Serenade is a bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, that helps prevent the powdery mildew from infecting the plant. While this product functions to kill the powdery mildew organism and is nontoxic to people, pets, and beneficial insects, it has not proven to be as effective as the oils or sulfur in controlling this disease. How to Use Apply protectant fungicides, such as wettable sulfur, to susceptible plants before or in the earliest stages of disease development. The protectant fungicides are only effective on contact, so applications must provide thorough coverage of all susceptible plant parts. As plants grow and produce new tissue, additional applications may be necessary at 7- to 10-day intervals as long as conditions are conducive to disease growth. If mild to moderate powdery mildew symptoms are present, the horticultural oils and plant-based oils such as neem oil and jojoba oil can be used to reduce or eliminate the infection.",

Avoiding the most susceptible cultivars, placing plants in full sun, and following good cultural practices will adequately control powdery mildew in many situations. Some ornamentals do require protection with fungicide sprays if mildew conditions are more favorable, especially susceptible varieties of rose and crape myrtle. (See Table 1.)

Choose resistant varieties to reduce the likelihood of having to apply sprays.\tTable 3.

Locate plants in sunny areas as much as possible, provide good air circulation, and avoid excess fertilizing or use a slow-release fertilizer. Overhead sprinkling actually may reduce the spread of powdery mildew, because it washes spores off the plant. Also, if spores land in water, they die. The best time to irrigate is mid-morning, so plants dry rapidly, reducing the likelihood of infections by other fungi, such as ones that cause rust or black spot on roses. As new shoots begin to develop on perennial plants, watch closely for signs of powdery mildew. Fungicide Applications In some situations, especially when growing roses, you may need to use fungicides, which function as protectants, eradicants, or both. A protectant fungicide prevents new infections from occurring, whereas an eradicant can kill an existing infection. Apply protectant fungicides to highly susceptible plants before the disease appears. Use eradicants at the earliest signs of the disease. Once mildew growth is extensive, controlling the situation with any fungicide becomes more difficult. Fungicides Several least-toxic fungicides are available, including horticultural oils, neem oil, jojoba oil, sulfur, potassium bicarbonate, and the biological fungicide Serenade. With the exception of the oils, these materials are primarily preventive, although potassium bicarbonate has some eradicant activity. Oils work best as eradicants but also have some protectant activity. Oils To eradicate mild to heavy powdery mildew infections, use a horticultural oil such as JMS Stylet Oil, Saf-T-Side Spray Oil, Sunspray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil, or one of the plant-based oils such as neem oil (e.g., Powdery Mildew Killer) or jojoba oil (e.g., E-rase). Be careful, however, never to apply an oil spray within 2 weeks of a sulfur spray, or it may injure plants. Also, you never should apply oils when temperatures are above 90°F or to water-stressed plants. Some plants may be more sensitive than others, and the interval required between sulfur and oil sprays may need to be even longer. Always consult the fungicide label for any special precautions. Of the horticultural oils, JMS Stylet Oil is the most highly refined and therefore the least likely to damage plants, but it may be more difficult to obtain than the others. Sulfur Sulfur products have been used to manage powdery mildew for centuries but are effective only when applied before the disease appears. The best sulfur products to use for powdery mildew control in gardens are wettable sulfurs that are specially formulated with surfactants similar to those in dishwashing detergent (e.g., Safer Garden Fungicide). However, you shouldn’t use dishwashing detergent with sulfur. Additionally, sulfur can damage some ornamental cultivars. To avoid injuring any plant, do not apply sulfur when the temperature is near or higher than 90°F, and do not apply it within 2 weeks of an oil spray. Other sulfur products, such as liquid lime sulfur or sulfur dust, are much more difficult to use, irritate skin and eyes, and are limited in the types plants you safely can use them on. Bicarbonates Also available to licensed applicators only is a fungicide containing potassium bicarbonate (e.g., Kaligreen). Sprays of potassium bicarbonate can injure the plant, so use these products with caution. Biological Fungicides Biological fungicides (e.g., Serenade) are commercially available beneficial microorganisms formulated into a product that, when sprayed on the plant, destroys fungal pathogens. The active ingredient in Serenade is a bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, that helps prevent the powdery mildew from infecting the plant. These products have some effect in killing the powdery mildew organism but are not as effective as the oils or sulfur in controlling it. Synthetic Fungicides Myclobutanil (Immunox) also is available to the home gardener and functions as an eradicant and protectant against both powdery mildew and rust. How to Use Apply protectant fungicides to susceptible plants before or in the earliest stages of disease development. Once mildew growth is mild to moderate, it generally is too late for effective control with protectant fungicides. These are effective only on contact, so applications must thoroughly cover all susceptible plant parts. As plants grow and produce new tissue, additional applications may be necessary at 7- to 10-day intervals as long as conditions favor disease growth. If mild to moderate powdery mildew is present, you can use horticultural and plant-based oils such as neem or jojoba oil.",

Infected tissue can be recognized by the young emerging leaves being deformed or showing a puckered condition. Soon after emergence infected leaves begin to exhibit white mycelial growth on the leaf surface. This combination of symptoms is characteristic of early season mildew onset. If powdery mildew has been present during the season on woody species, prune out infected tissue during the dormant season. Prune grapevines during dormancy and position shoots during the growing season to allow exposure of fruit to sunlight and good air flow through the canopy. Pruning and training are also helpful in controlling Botrytis bunch rot. Because one common powdery mildew fungus, Sphaerotheca pannosa, often spreads disease from roses to stone fruits, try to avoid planting apricot or plum trees near highly susceptible rose bushes. If roses are nearby and can’t be removed, control powdery mildew infections on them. On apple trees, look carefully for infected shoots and buds in the dormant season and remove them. Infected buds are flattened or shriveled compared to normal buds. The buds and infected shoots have a thin layer of fuzzy white fungus on their surfaces that usually is easy to see. Where practical, remove and dispose of overwintering leaves on strawberry plants that are infected. If raspberry canes develop powdery mildew, remove the canes down to the roots during the dormant season. Infected canes of berries and grapevines have distinctive weblike russetting. Remove infected prunings from the garden area and destroy them. Fungicide Applications Where powdery mildew has been a problem in the past, fungicides may be needed. Fungicides function as protectants, eradicants, or both. A protectant fungicide can only prevent a new infection from occurring, but an eradicant will kill an existing infection. Apply protectant fungicides to highly susceptible plants before the disease appears. Eradicants should be used at the earliest appearance of the disease. Once mildew growth is extensive, control with fungicides becomes more difficult. Fungicides. Several least-toxic fungicides are available for backyard trees and vines, including horticultural oils, neem oil, jojoba oil, sulfur, and the biological fungicide Serenade. With the exception of the oils, these materials are primarily preventive. Oils work best as eradicants but also work as good protectants. The fungicides listed here are registered for home use. Commercial growers should consult the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines for fungicides for commercial use. Oils. To eradicate powdery mildew infections, use a horticultural oil such as Saf-T-Side Spray Oil, Sunspray Ultra-Fine Spray Oil or one of the plant-based oils such as neem oil (such as Green Light Neem Concentrate) or jojoba oil (such as E-rase). Be careful, however, never to apply an oil spray within 2 weeks of a sulfur spray or plants may be injured. Some plants may be more sensitive than others, however, and the interval required between sulfur and oil sprays may be even longer; always consult the fungicide label for any special precautions. Also, oils should never be applied when temperatures are above 90°F or to drought-stressed plants. Horticultural oils and neem and jojoba oils are registered on a wide variety of crops. Sulfur. Sulfur products have been used to manage powdery mildew for centuries but are only effective when applied before disease symptoms appear. The best sulfur products to use for powdery mildew control in gardens are wettable sulfurs that are specially formulated with surfactants similar to those in dishwashing detergent (such as Safer Garden Fungicide). To avoid injury to the plant or tree, sulfurs should not be applied within 2 weeks of an oil spray, used on any plant when the temperature is near or over 90°F (80°F for caneberries and strawberry), and never applied at any temperature to apricot trees.\tBiological Fungicides. Biological fungicides (Serenade) are commercially available beneficial microorganisms formulated into a product that, when sprayed on the plant, inhibit or destroy fungal pathogens. The active ingredient in Serenade is a bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, that helps prevent the powdery mildew from infecting the plant. While this product functions to kill the powdery mildew organism and is nontoxic to people, pets, and beneficial insects, it has not proven to be as effective as the oils or sulfur in controlling this disease. How to Use. Apply protectant fungicides to susceptible plants before disease develops. Once mildew growth is mild to moderate, it is generally too late for protective fungicides to effectively control powdery mildew except for on new plant growth. The protectant fungicides are only effective on contact, so applications must provide thorough coverage of all susceptible plant parts. As plants grow and produce new tissue, additional applications may be necessary at 7- to 10-day intervals as long as conditions are conducive to disease growth. On highly susceptible plants, sulfur can be applied early in the season when temperatures are below 90°F and then to switch to other materials as the season progresses. However, applying oil, which is both a protectant and an eradicant, for the early sprays provides the best control. If mild to moderate powdery mildew symptoms are present, the horticultural oils and plant-based oils such as neem oil and jojoba oil can be used. Caneberries and Grapevines. Dormant or delayed dormant sulfur sprays can be used as a preventive measure before canes begin to grow in spring. Fungicides registered for use on caneberries include wettable sulfur and oils including neem oil. Don’t apply sulfur when temperatures exceed 90°F. Strawberry. Treat as soon as symptoms appear. Be sure to spray both upper and lower leaf surfaces. It may help to remove and destroy affected leaves before treating the rest of the planting. Materials registered to control powdery mildew include sulfur and oils. The sulfur treatments also reduce mite populations, but don’t apply sulfur when temperatures exceed 80°F because it damages foliage and fruit. Apple and Stone Fruit. Sprays are not necessary in many backyard situations. However, if you have had serious powdery mildew damage in past years, treat at 2-week intervals, beginning when buds just start to open (green tip stage), until small, green fruit are present. (Caution: Do not use sulfur on apricot trees.) Sulfur, horticultural oils, neem oil, and Serenade are all registered for powdery mildew on backyard trees. Grapevines. Powdery mildew is a perennial problem in grapevines. Begin applying treatments when all buds have pushed. Thereafter, repeat at 10-day intervals if disease pressure is high; otherwise, extend intervals when temperatures are above 90°F until the sugar content of the grapes is 12 to 15%, which is when they begin to soften and approach ripeness and are no longer susceptible to infection. You can measure the sugar content with a refractometer, if you have access to one, or you can see if sample berries sink in a 15% sucrose solution. (Prepare the sucrose solution by dissolving 8-1/2 teaspoons of table sugar in a half cup of warm water, then mixing in enough cold water to make the total volume 1 cup.) Sulfur, horticultural oils, neem oil, jojoba oil, and Serenade are registered for controlling powdery mildew in home vineyards.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Pitch canker, a disease that affects many pine species, is caused by the fungus Fusarium circinatum. This fungus can also infect Douglas-fir, but symptoms are usually limited to tip dieback. Most pines native to California are susceptible to pitch canker, but Monterey pine, Pinus radiata, is the most widely affected host. The most recent severe outbreak of this disease in California was in populations of native bishop pine, P. muricata, at the Point Reyes National Seashore. Pitch canker was first observed in California in Santa Cruz County in 1986. Since then the disease has spread rapidly and now occurs in 18 coastal counties. Pitch canker also occurs in the southeastern United States and in Mexico, Chile, Japan, South Korea, Italy, France, Spain, Portugal, and South Africa. Evidence indicates the pathogen may have originated in Mexico, and its introduction into California came by way of the southeastern United States.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Pitch canker can result in extensive damage and even death of infected trees. However, not all infected trees become severely diseased, and of those that do, some recover. Experiments under controlled conditions show that susceptible Monterey pine trees repeatedly exposed to the pathogen may gain resistance over time, and field studies have confirmed that trees in areas where pitch canker has been present for 10 or more years tend to be more resistant to the disease than trees in areas where the pathogen has only recently become established. Therefore, landowners and land managers should take a conservative approach to removing diseased trees, because there is a possibility they may recover completely. Resistance to Pitch Canker Although Monterey pine is a susceptible species, some individual trees are resistant to the disease. Resistant Monterey pines can be vegetatively propagated as rooted cuttings, and trees that develop from cuttings of resistant trees retain the resistance of the parent tree. Resistance may be a useful tool for managing the disease in landscape settings, on Christmas tree farms, and in commercial forestry. However, genetic resistance may cease to be effective due to changes in the pathogen population over time. Trees that now appear resistant could become susceptible if more virulent strains of the fungus arise through mutations or genetic recombination due to sexual reproduction, or if new strains of the fungus are introduced from elsewhere in the world. Thus, Monterey pines will always be at some risk of future damage from pitch canker, and resistant Monterey pine stock should be used only where planting a nonsusceptible species isn't an option. Preventing Movement of the Pathogen In order to minimize damage caused by pitch canker, it is important to prevent movement of the pathogen to noninfested areas. With this in mind, the California State Board of Forestry designated a zone of infestation that includes most of coastal California as described on a site maintained by the Pitch Canker Task Force. You can also contact the agricultural commissioner in your county to determine whether you are within this zone. Local regulations may apply to moving potentially infested materials to areas outside the zone of infestation. Because the pathogen can survive in wood cut from infected trees, use or dispose of infected trees locally; see www.firewood.ca.gov. The pathogen can also survive in soil or seed and can infect seedlings that show no symptoms. Consequently, avoid moving any of these materials into areas where the disease doesn't already occur. Managing the Disease in Infected Trees Where trees have sustained a limited number of infections, removing symptomatic branches can effectively eliminate the disease. Of course, new infections can occur, and studies have shown that pruning doesn't slow the development of pitch canker in stands where the disease is well established. However, pruning can be used strategically to enhance the aesthetic quality of a tree and thereby delay its removal from the landscape. In areas where Monterey pine isn't native—most of California outside of Año Nuevo, Cambria, and Monterey—when replanting, select pines that are resistant to pitch canker (Table 2) or select other nonsusceptible trees. Although insects often initiate infections, insecticides don't offer a practical way to control pitch canker. Likewise, fungicides with activity against the pitch canker pathogen are available, but no effective techniques for using them to control the disease have yet been demonstrated. For more information about managing pitch canker, consult the Web site of the Pitch Canker Task Force listed in Online Resources.\tTable 2.

Species are rated as susceptible (S) if they sustained definite lesions at the site of inoculation or resistant (R) if there was little or no lesion development. For species rated as S-, most tested individuals were resistant, but a small percentage appeared moderately susceptible. N indicates a species that hasn't been tested.\t3 Field susceptibility is based on observations of natural infections. Species are rated as susceptible (S) if numerous trees are known to be infected, if some trees have sustained severe damage from pitch canker, or both. Species that have frequently been observed in otherwise infested areas, for which few or no trees are known to have sustained natural infections and none has been heavily damaged by pitch canker are rated as resistant (R); the level of resistance differs within this group. For species rated as S-, one or more infected trees have been observed, but the number of observations is too limited to provide a meaningful estimate of their relative susceptibility. For species rated as N, no infected trees have been observed, but the occurrence of this species in proximity to natural inoculum is too infrequent to conclude that the lack of disease is indicative of resistance.\nREFERENCES Bonello, P., T.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Several species of soilborne pathogens in the genus Phytophthora cause crown and root rot diseases of herbaceous and woody plants. Almost all fruit and nut trees, as well as most ornamental trees and shrubs (including many California natives), can develop Phytophthora rot if soil around the base of the plant remains wet for prolonged periods, or when planted too deeply. Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and other vegetable crops can also be affected by Phytophthora rot. In trees and shrubs, the pathogen kills plants by growing from the roots up through the root crown and into the lower trunk, where it kills the inner bark and causes a browning of the outer layer of sapwood. In many of these crops, different species of Phytophthora are involved. Losses to Phytophthora are minimized by providing good soil drainage and selecting the most tolerant rootstocks or varieties available. In general, Phytophthora requires warm, moist soils in order to cause disease. Another species of Phytophthora, Phytophthora ramorum, causes sudden oak death, which has very different symptoms and management than the species discussed here. See Pest Note: Sudden Oak Death in California. SYMPTOMS The leaves of plants affected by Phytophthora rot appear drought stressed. Trees or plants often wilt and die rapidly with the first warm weather of the season. Leaves may turn dull green, yellow, or in some cases red or purplish. Often, only plants in the most poorly drained area of the field or garden are affected. Phytophthora infections typically kill young trees, because their root systems and crown areas are small compared to those of mature trees. Symptoms may develop first on one branch or stem then spread to the rest of a tree or plant. Trees may decline over a period of years before finally dying or they may be killed in a single season. Slow decline occurs when the roots are attacked; rapid decline occurs when the crown or basal stem is attacked and girdled, the damage completely encircling the stem in a single season. Symptoms on roots and crowns may vary somewhat depending on the species of Phytophthora involved, the plant being attacked, the resistance of the plant variety, and soil moisture and temperature. In general, trees affected by Phytophthora develop darkened areas in the bark around the crown and upper roots. Gum or dark sap may ooze from the margins of the diseased trunk area. If bark tissue is carefully cut away, reddish brown streaks or zones can be seen in the inner bark and outer layer of wood. No mycelium (slender filaments of a fungus body) is visible in between the bark and wood in trees affected by Phytophthora, distinguishing this disease from Armillaria root rot, which is caused by a true fungus. When tomatoes and eggplants are affected by Phytophthora root rot, roots of all sizes develop water-soaked spots that dry out and turn a chocolate brown as the disease becomes advanced. Early infections, caused by Phytophthora and other pathogens that cause damping-off diseases, kill seedlings. For more information on damping-off diseases, see Pest Notes: Damping-Off Diseases in the Garden . Later infections reduce plant vigor and may cause collapse and death of the plant. If you cut infected tap roots in cross section, you will see that the stele (central core of conducting tissue) is brownish above the rot lesions. Stele discoloration may extend into the lower stem. BIOLOGY Phytophthora species are soil-inhabiting pathogens that are favored by wet conditions. Although previously considered fungi, Phytophthora species are now considered to be in a separate classification called oomycetes. Species of Phytophthora produce resting spores that survive for years in moist soil in the absence of a suitable host. However, if the soil is completely dried out, these spores are less likely to survive for more than a few months. When a host is nearby and free water (water in soil pore spaces) is present in the soil, resting spores germinate to produce motile spores that can directly penetrate roots, branches, or crowns as long as free water is present. Wounds are not required for infection. Resting spores, decaying host tissue in the soil, and active cankers (disease-infected dead, sunken lesions in plant parts) can all be sources for new infections. The pathogen can be spread in splashing rain or irrigation water, in surface irrigation, and runoff water, and by movement of contaminated soil, equipment, or plant parts. Flooded and saturated soil favors the spread of Phytophthora to healthy plants. Some Phytophthora species are favored by warm weather, some by cool weather. Root rots of avocado, citrus, and tomato are favored by warm conditions, developing most extensively in late spring and early summer. Decay of crown, trunk, and branches of other tree species are favored by cool, wet conditions. These decays develop most rapidly in late fall and early spring.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "The most important factor in reducing the threat of Phytophthora rot is good water management. Avoid prolonged saturation of the soil or standing water around the base of trees or other susceptible plants. Irrigate only as much and as often as necessary; in an orchard, keep track of the soil moisture around each tree and water only when necessary. If you irrigate trees with sprinklers, use low-angle sprinkler heads and splitters to avoid wetting the trunk and lower branches. If using a drip system, place the emitters at least a foot away from the trunk. Avoid planting susceptible species on poorly drained or shallow soils. Water stress and/or salinity make some plant species more susceptible to infection when wetted subsequently by irrigation or rains. For all vegetable and orchard plants, provide good soil drainage. Good soil drainage is best provided before planting. Drainage should be plentiful to the rooting depth of the plants, generally 3 to 6 feet for trees, 2 to 4 feet for shrubs, and 1 to 2 feet for bedding plants. During favorable weather you do not want the roots and crown of a plant to remain wet for the 4 to 8 hours that are required for Phytophthora to infect the plant. Provide adequate drainage by breaking through soil compaction and hardpan. In poorly drained soils, or in an area where you know Phytophthora is present, consider planting trees and shrubs on mounds. The mounds should be 8 to 10 inches high. Planting depth after settling should be no deeper than as received from the nursery, with the upper roots near the soil level and the graft union well above the soil line. Do not install irrigated turf around the base of trees, remove all weeds, and do not water the crown area directly. Never cover the graft union with soil or mulch. If you are not sure where the graft union is, ask someone at the nursery to show you and mark it. Raised beds provide good drainage in vegetable garden situations also. Group plants according to their irrigation needs. Separate those needing frequent, light irrigations, such as potatoes and strawberries, from those needing infrequent, deep irrigations, such as tomatoes and melons. At the first signs of aboveground symptoms, examine the tree at the soil line for crown rot. Carefully cut away bark that looks affected. If crown rot is present, trees can sometimes be saved by removing soil from the base of the tree down to the top of the main roots and allowing the crown tissue to dry out. Sanitation It may be possible to slow the spread of Phytophthora within an orchard by avoiding movement of infested soil, water, and plant parts from an area where Phytophthora rot has developed. Surface and subsurface drainage water and anything that can move moist soil can carry the pathogen to a new area, including boots, car tires, and tools. If the physical setting allows drainage water to flow from infested to uninfected areas within the garden during wet weather, consider putting in drains to channel the water away from healthy plants. Selection of planting stock Plant only certified nursery stock from a reputable source, and choose the most resistant rootstocks or varieties available for your area. Less susceptible rootstocks or varieties are available for almonds and stone fruit, apples, cauliflower, and strawberries. Carefully select individual plants that are free of symptoms and/or that come from healthy lots of material. Rotation If tomatoes have been affected by Phytophthora root rot, avoid planting tomatoes or other susceptible plants such as eggplant or peppers in the same soil for at least one or two seasons. Plant a resistant crop such as corn instead, or leave the soil unplanted and do not irrigate, but keep it well worked to allow the soil to dry as deeply as possible. Different species of Phytophthora attack beans and cole crops, so these plants can be substituted as well. Consult a nursery or farm advisor for possible alternatives in your area. Chemical control The most effective way of preventing Phytophthora rot diseases is to provide good drainage and to practice good water management. Along with the appropriate cultural controls, the fungicide fosetyl-al (Aliette) may be used on a number of ornamental plant species to help prevent Phytophthora infections. When applied as a foliar spray it is absorbed by foliage and moves into roots. However, do not rely on fungicide applications alone to control root and crown rot diseases.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "To prevent peach leaf curl, use resistant peach and nectarine varieties where possible. (See the Resistant Varieties section below.) For nonresistant varieties, treat trees with a fungicide every year after leaves have fallen. In cooler northern locations leaf fall usually is in late November. In warmer southern locations leaf fall can be as late as early January. Generally a single early treatment when the tree is dormant is effective, although in areas of high rainfall or during a particularly wet winter, it might be advisable to apply a second spray late in the dormant season, preferably as flower buds begin to swell but before green leaf tips are first visible. Resistant Varieties A few peach varieties are available that are resistant or partially resistant to leaf curl. Currently available resistant varieties include Frost, Indian Free, Muir, and Q-1-8. The peach cultivar Frost is reportedly very tolerant but must receive fungicide applications the first 2 to 3 years. Redhaven peach and most cultivars derived from it are tolerant to peach leaf curl, whereas Redskin peach and cultivars derived from it range from susceptible to highly susceptible to the disease. There are fewer resistant nectarines, although Kreibich is one such variety. Fungicides Copper Historically, the most commonly used fungicides available to home gardeners have been the fixed copper products. For all copper-containing products, the active ingredient, copper, is listed as “metallic copper equivalent,” or MCE, on the label. Various product formulations differ widely in their metallic copper content. The higher the MCE, the greater the amount of copper and the more effective the product will be. However, other factors such as coverage, use of additives as such stickers and spreaders, and frequency and duration of rain, which can wash off the copper, also will impact product effectiveness. In all cases, the copper is active only when it is wet, when the copper ions are in solution. Fixed copper products include tribasic or basic copper sulfate, cupric hydroxide, and copper oxychloride sulfate (C-O-C-S), but currently only liquid products containing copper ammonium complex products with 8% MCE (e.g., Kop R Spray Concentrate [Lilly Miller brands] and Liqui-Cop [Monterey Lawn and Garden]) are available to consumers. The most effective copper product, 90% tribasic copper sulfate with a 50% MCE (Microcop), is no longer available to retail outlets, because the manufacturer withdrew the product in 2010, although remaining supplies still can be sold. The copper ammonium complex products can be made more effective by adding 1% horticultural spray oil to the application mix; the oil also aids in controlling some aphids, scale insects, and mites. Copper soap (copper octanoate) fungicides are also available, and preliminary research indicates they may provide some protection of trees. Be aware that repeated annual use of copper products over many seasons can result in a buildup of copper in the soil, which eventually can become toxic to soil organisms, and if it moves into waterways, can harm some aquatic species. Bordeaux Mixture Copper sulfate is not a fixed copper and, when used alone, is less effective than tribasic copper sulfate or other fixed copper products. However, if copper sulfate is mixed with hydrated lime to make a Bordeaux mixture, the copper sulfate and calcium in the lime react together to form a fixed copper product that is effective against peach leaf curl. Bordeaux mixture is not available for sale; it must be mixed up just before application, and the ingredients can be very difficult to find. For information on preparing Bordeaux mixture see Pest Notes: Bordeaux Mixture. Other Fungicides The synthetic fungicide chlorothalonil currently is the only other noncopper fungicide available for managing peach leaf curl on backyard trees. Lime sulfur (calcium polysulfide) products no longer are registered for backyard use. Application Thorough coverage with any fungicide is essential to obtain adequate disease control. Trees should be sprayed to the point of runoff or until they are dripping. When using pesticides, always read and follow the label for usage, rates, toxicity, and proper disposal. Proper protective clothing and gear including goggles should be used when handling any pesticides. Physical Controls Although symptoms of leaf curl are seen primarily in spring as new leaves develop, there is little you can do to control the disease at this time. Some people remove diseased leaves or prune infected shoots, but this has not been shown to improve control. Normally, diseased leaves fall off within a few weeks and are replaced by new, healthy leaves, unless it is rainy. If a tree is severely affected with peach leaf curl this can stunt its growth, so consider thinning fruit later in the season. Pruning in fall prior to applying any fungicides can reduce spore numbers overwintering on the tree and reduce the amount of fungicide needed. If leaf curl symptoms occurred on your trees in spring, be sure to treat the following fall and/or winter to prevent more serious losses the following year.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Peach leaf curl is a fungal disease that affects only peach and nectarine trees. Distorted, reddened foliage in spring is a distinctive symptom. New leaves and shoots thicken, pucker, and may later die and fall off. If you allow an infection to go untreated for several years, it can lead to tree decline. To prevent peach leaf curl, treat peach and nectarine trees with a preventive fungicide every year after leaves fall. Treating after symptoms appear won’t be effective. When planting, consider tree varieties resistant to the disease. Look for symptoms in spring. New leaves and shoots redden and pucker. Leaves may yellow or be covered with powdery gray spores; they might also drop. Cool, wet spring weather prolongs disease development. A second set of normal leaves will replace fallen leaves, and tree growth will appear normal after weather turns dry and warm (79° to 87°F), although spores that can infect next year’s growth may remain. Symptoms won’t appear later in the season. What about pesticides? The safest, effective fungicides available for backyard trees are copper soap (copper octanoate) or the fixed copper fungicide, copper ammonium. Apply either of these copper products with 1% spray oil to increase effectiveness. Bordeaux mixture is a home-made copper sulfate and lime mixture that must be carefully mixed up just prior to treatment. However, the raw materials are difficult to find. For more information, see Pest Notes : Bordeaux Mixture. The synthetic fungicide chlorothalonil is also effective. Treat trees with a fungicide in late fall and winter. The fungal spores that cause the disease spend the winter on twigs and buds and germinate in the spring. For effective control, treat trees just after leaves have fallen, usually late November or December. A second application in late winter before buds swell is advisable, especially in areas with high rainfall or during wet winters. Don’t apply fungicides during the growing season because they won’t be effective. Make fungicide applications effective and safe. All peach leaf curl fungicides have environmental and health risks. Wear protective clothing and follow label directions to stop drift or runoff. When you spray, thoroughly cover all branches and twigs until dripping to ensure all spores are killed. After many years of use, copper ions from copper-based fungicides can accumulate in soil. This can harm soil microorganisms and, through runoff, aquatic organisms. Take care when using these materials to avoid excessive runoff. ",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Several major, potentially lethal diseases can attack landscape palms in California. The best strategy for managing these diseases is an integrated approach that combines prevention, exclusion, sanitation, appropriate species selection, and proper care. Selecting the right palm for the right spot, then planting and caring for it properly, are critical to avoid most diseases or help palms recover from some diseases. Maintain healthy, vigorous palms through appropriate selection and cultivation.\tSelect the right palm for the right place.\tPlant and transplant palms correctly.\tFollow appropriate irrigation practices.\tApply a specialized palm fertilizer—one high in nitrogen and potassium with half as much magnesium as potassium—following label rates and directions.\tKeep turfgrass, groundcovers, shrubs, and weeds at least 2 feet away from the trunk, and maintain mulch several inches deep over this area.\tApply mulch.\tMinimize pruning and other cultivation practices that can wound palms.\tAvoid using chain saws and tree spikes, because they can spread inoculum and cause wounds.\tUse straight-edge, manual saws, thoroughly disinfect blades before use on each palm, and prune out and appropriately discard of infected material and palms.\tDon't recycle or chip infected material for use as mulch, because it might contain and spread the pathogens.\tEven if you inherit a poorly adapted or managed palm, providing proper care can significantly reduce the chances for disease development and help reduce disease severity. Prevention is usually better than treating a disease after it develops, and in some instances, it is the only option. Use fungicides only as a last resort. Table 1 provides quick identification of the major palm diseases discussed in this publication. Table 2 lists common palms in California, their botanical names, and their resistance or susceptibility to these diseases. DIAMOND SCALE Despite the name, diamond scale is not an insect pest. Instead the fungus Phaeochoropsis neowashingtoniae causes this common foliar disease, which derives its name from its characteristic black, diamond-shaped fruiting bodies. Hosts: Diamond scale attacks primarily the California fan palm in coastal regions and the intermediate and interior valleys of California subject to marine influence; it rarely occurs in arid regions such as the Central Valley or the deserts of Southern California. Diamond scale can occur on hybrids of the California fan palm with the Mexican fan palm, and the incidence and severity usually are proportional to the amount of California fan palm in the hybrid. Diamond scale has not been observed on pure Mexican fan palm or any other palm species in California. Symptoms and Biology: The palm typically has a much reduced canopy of leaves. Older or lower leaves prematurely yellow and die. Close inspection reveals shiny black, diamond-shaped fruiting bodies 1/8 to 1/3-inch long by 1/16 to 1/8-inch wide on leaf blades and petioles. Lower, older leaves are most severely affected because the longer the leaf remains exposed, the greater the number of infections; however, even upper, new green leaves will have some black fruiting bodies. Initial infection sites are dark, water-soaked spots the size of a pinprick that eventually turn black and enlarge. Heavily infected leaves have a black, sooty dust that rubs off easily when you brush against or handle them during removal, making the plant a nuisance to work with. Disease severity often is cyclical. The dry, warm seasons of summer and fall favor growth of California fan palm rather than diamond scale. Palms tend to grow quickly, producing leaves faster than the pathogen can colonize them. In contrast, the moist, cool seasons of winter and spring favor the pathogen over the host. Palms tend to grow more slowly, and the disease advances higher into the canopy, resulting in a sparse canopy of leaves. Because of their more vigorous growth rate, young palms tend to have less disease and a fuller canopy of leaves than older, less vigorously growing plants. Although not particularly lethal by itself, diamond scale reduces vigor and stresses the palm, leaving it vulnerable to other diseases such as pink rot. Management: The best option in areas where the disease occurs is to replace the California fan palm with diamond scale-resistant species of similar habit, such as the Mexican blue palm, San Jose hesper palm, Guadalupe palm, Australian fountain palm, Chinese fountain or fan palm, Chinese windmill palm, and pure Mexican fan palm. Keep existing California fan palms as vigorous as possible by irrigating regularly, especially in the summer and during winters with little rainfall. Fertilize regularly to encourage rapid growth. The fungal spores that cause diamond scale are everywhere and can travel by wind and water; therefore, removing and disposing of infected leaves is probably not a viable management strategy.\tTable 1.

The fungus destroys the vascular tissue of the palm, leading to decreased water uptake, wilt, and death. Host: Different forms of Fusarium oxysporum exist, and they typically are host-species-specific. The form in California, and referred to as forma specialis canariensis, causes disease only on Canary Island date palms in the landscape. However, in a field experiment forma specialis canariensis also attacked California fan palm and Senegal date palm. Keep in mind that forma specialis canariensis has only been observed attacking Canary Island date palms, not other kinds of palm, in a landscape setting. Other forms of Fusarium oxysporum cause wilts on other kinds of date palms and other palm species but in other parts of the world. Symptoms and Biology: The palm has a much reduced canopy of leaves. Symptoms usually appear in older or lower leaves in the canopy first, then move toward the upper or newest leaves, although occasionally mid-canopy leaves are affected first. Leaves turn yellow then brown but remain hanging on the palm. Initially symptoms might affect the leaflets or pinnae on only one side of the leaf. Pinnae on the other side remain green, although they eventually also will turn brown and die. This pattern was once thought to be diagnostic for Fusarium wilt, but other diseases such as petiole and rachis blights and pink rot also can cause one-sided death of leaves. Pinnae death typically occurs first at the base then moves progressively toward the leaf tip, although this pattern sometimes is reversed. In contrast to petiole and rachis blights (see later), which also produce one-sided leaf death but only on a few leaves, typically with Fusarium wilt many leaves in the canopy are affected or dead. The quantity of diseased or dead leaves or green, healthy leaves in the canopy can help to identify most cases of Fusarium wilt. Typically with Fusarium wilt a preponderance of leaves in the canopy will be affected or dead. Similarly, if the palm is frequently pruned to remove dead leaves and constantly appears to have a much reduced canopy of living leaves, it likely has Fusarium wilt. Another common symptom of Fusarium wilt is extensive, external, brown to black discoloration or streaking along the petiole and rachis. This streaking corresponds to internal discoloration of vascular tissue when viewed in transverse section. Internally the tissue is reddish-brown and often has a slight pinkish blush ; although incompletely understood, this pinkish discoloration might be diagnostic for the disease. In the landscape, Fusarium wilt nearly always spreads on pruning tools, especially chain saws. The pathogen enters cut petioles and, in extreme cases, the cut and exposed vascular tissue of severely pruned or skinned trunks (trunks where the persistent leaf bases have been skinned or peeled off). The pathogen can spread indirectly during pruning, because contaminated sawdust can drift as far as 100 feet. The pathogen also can spread by entering the palm through its roots. Canary Island date palms tend to form a dense, extensive network of above-ground roots called pneumatophores, especially under excessively damp or wet conditions, and these may facilitate pathogen entry. Fusarium wilt might spread if people dispose of diseased palms or their seeds using a municipal yard-waste program that recycles debris into mulch. The pathogen can survive in the soil for at least 25 years. Infected palms can die within a few months after symptoms appear, or they can linger for several years. Because wilt diseases decrease the ability of the host to take up water, palms with Fusarium wilt in cooler, more humid environments such as near the coast, might show reduced disease severity and survive for many years. Infected palms in hotter, drier interior climates might show severe symptoms and die rapidly. Because Fusarium wilt stresses palms, the opportunistic and mostly secondary disease pink rot is frequently present and can obscure or mask symptoms and hasten death. In fact, pink rot might kill a palm before Fusarium wilt runs its course. Management: Because no cure exists for Fusarium wilt and it is nearly 100 percent fatal, prevention and exclusion are critical to disease management. When first planting, obtain palms from a reliable source, and avoid poorly drained soils and excessive irrigation that can increase the formation of above-ground roots. Keep the area around the base of the trunk free of plants, which can damage above-ground roots, and avoid using municipal yard waste as mulch on Canary Island date palms. Do not replant a Canary Island date palm in the same site where one died or was removed because of Fusarium wilt. The fungus surviving can infect a new, healthy palm. Instead, use other species of palms including Mexican blue palm, San Jose hesper palm, Guadalupe palm, pindo palm, queen palm, and Mexican fan palm. If you want the date palm \"look,\" consider staminate (male) plants of the date palm (Phoenix dactylifera), which are more robust than the pistillate (female) fruit-bearing plants and more closely imitate the larger, robust habit of Canary Island date palms. Frequently pruned Canary Island date palms are more likely to suffer from Fusarium wilt than those in an unmaintained setting. If you must prune, thoroughly clean and disinfect all tools prior to work on each palm by vigorously brushing them to remove sawdust and other particles. Disinfect the tools for 10 minutes in a 1:3 pine-oil-to-water solution, 1:1 solution of household bleach, or heat saw blades for at least 10 seconds per side with a handheld butane torch. Clean and disinfect (as described above) all tools used in the root zones of Canary Island date palms such as shovels, spades, rakes, hoes, and weeders, because they can spread the disease. Use manual pruning saws rather than chain saws whenever possible, because chain saws are difficult if not impossible to clean and disinfect adequately. If you have extremely valuable palms, consider using a new saw for each tree, which you either could discard after one use or dedicate for future use on that one palm only. Avoid pruning palms in windy weather to minimize the spread of sawdust. Because a Canary Island date palm with Fusarium wilt eventually will die, it is prudent to remove it as soon as possible. To avoid spreading the pathogen, excavate the root ball and use a crane to remove the palm with its crown of leaves, trunk, and root ball still attached, if possible. Keep cutting, grinding, and digging to a minimum. Use plastic or wooden barriers to contain sawdust and other diseased plant parts during removal. After collecting and securely bagging all debris, prepare removed palms for incineration or removal to a landfill; do not use a waste recycling program. Removing the soil will likely not prevent the spread of Fusarium wilt because just one small piece of infected root is all that is necessary to infect a newly planted palm.\tTable 2.

The diseases cause the petiole (the slender stalk holding the leaf blade to the leaf base) and sometimes the rachis (the extension of the petiole with pinnae along its length), and then the entire leaf to die. Although typically not lethal, they can stress the palm sufficiently that other diseases kill it. Hosts: Petiole and rachis blights primarily attack date palms and California and Mexican fan palms. Symptoms and Biology: The palm often has a reduced canopy of leaves . Lower or older leaves are first and most severely affected. In the pinnate-leaved date palms pinnae typically die on one side of leaf blade first, with those on the opposing side remaining green (compare with Fusarium wilt earlier). In the fan palms, segments in the leaf blade yellow and die in a wedge-shape pattern . In both types of palms the petiole and rachis typically have a reddish brown, dark brown, or even black streak that corresponds to internal discoloration of vascular tissue when viewed in transverse section. Close examination of diseased petioles and rachises might reveal fungal structures of the pathogen, especially fruiting bodies, causing the blight. Eventually the entire leaf dies. In contrast to Fusarium wilt on Canary Island date palms, which also produces one-sided leaf death and affects many leaves in the canopy, typically with petiole and rachis blights only a few leaves in the canopy are diseased. While pinnae (of a pinnate leaf) or segments (of a fan or palmate leaf) die, they are not infected; only the petiole or rachis is infected. Pinnae and segments die because the pathogen has caused vascular tissues in the petiole or rachis to die. Although the disease can move higher into the canopy, killing more leaves, it rarely kills the palm; however, it can weaken or stress a palm so that another disease like pink rot can kill it. Management: Little is known about management of petiole and rachis blights and environmental factors that favor disease development. Because fungal spores are probably the primary methods of disease spread and high humidity is likely an important factor encouraging disease development, sanitation and water management are critical in managing these blights. Removal and disposal of affected leaves might be a means of reducing disease spread to nearby palms. On smaller palms avoid overhead irrigation. Maintain palms in optimal cultivation and health as described earlier. PINK ROT The fungus Nalanthamala\tvermoeseni (previously called Penicillium vermoeseni or Gliocladium vermoeseni) causes the disease pink rot. Caused by a weak but opportunistic pathogen, pink rot primarily is a secondary disease that affects stressed, weakened, and or wounded palms. While it can attack all parts of a palm, it is most problematic in the growing tips, or apical meristem where new leaves are produced, and in newly emerged leaves. Its role in causing trunk decay on queen palm and other species is unconfirmed. Hosts: Pink rot can affect nearly all outdoor landscape and indoor palms in California, including king palms, bamboo palms, some date palms, Chinese windmill palms, kentia palms, queen palms, and California fan palms. Symptoms and Biology: Symptoms of pink rot are variable and include spotting and rotting on nearly any part of the palm. Symptoms occur on leaf bases, petioles, rachises, blades, the apical meristem area where leaves are produced, inflorescences (flower stalks), roots, and even the trunk although this latter occurrence is unconfirmed in many cases. Stunting, distortion, discoloration and even death of new leaves as they emerge from the apical meristem is common. Pinkish spore masses, from which the disease derives its name, are often present, especially when protected behind overlapping leaf bases or other structures. Brownish syrupy exudate also might be present. Infected plants weaken and decline and eventually can die, especially if the apical meristem is attacked. Like diamond scale, disease severity frequently can be cyclical in large, established palms. For example, the pathogen can infect growing tips and spear leaves, the youngest leaves that have not yet unfolded, during the cooler, moist weather of winter and spring when leaf production and growth are slow. This scenario is especially true of California fan palms. As weather warms in late spring and early summer and the winter-produced spear leaves push out and unfold, previous damage appears even though the disease no longer is active. The palm then produces an abundance of disease-free leaves during vigorous summer and fall growth. As leaf production and growth slow in the winter, the disease becomes more active again. This cyclical nature and the way palms produce leaves sequentially in the crown often results in a distinctive pattern of a few damaged leaves regularly distributed among otherwise healthy ones. Cultivation or environmental conditions can stress or weaken palms, making them susceptible to pink rot. These conditions include:\tpalms planted too deeply\ttransplanted palms, especially when done at the incorrect time of year, such as the fall and winter\texcessive irrigation\tpoor drainage\tpoorly aerated root zones\timproper nutrition\tpest infestations and other diseases and disorders\tcold weather or freeze damage\tinappropriate pruning and leaf-base removal\tpoorly adapted species\tAlthough not always necessary for disease development, wounds facilitate pathogen entry and increase infection risks. Avoid injuring palms when pruning and performing other horticultural procedures. Especially avoid premature leaf-base removal, which can tear and wound the trunk, causing permanent damage and increasing infection risk. High humidity and temperatures of 65° to 80°F favor the pathogen and disease development. Palms grown in cool, humid, coastal areas are more susceptible to pink rot than those grown in warmer, more arid, inland sites. Pink rot is unusually problematic on bamboo palms produced in humid greenhouses nurseries, especially if overhead sprinkler irrigation is used; in these situations it causes leaf and trunk rot, bleeding, wilt, and death. The fungal spores that cause pink rot are everywhere and can travel by wind and water; therefore, removing and disposing of infected leaves is probably not a viable management strategy. The judicious and temporary use of some fungicides can be effective in suppression of pink rot until the cultivation problems stressing the palm can be corrected; however, fungicidal treatment alone is not a viable management strategy. Fungicides can be beneficial after heavy pruning to protect wounds and freshly cut, immature tissue, or both, or temporarily to protect stressed palms in unfavorable environmental conditions. SUDDEN CROWN DROP Sudden crown drop is a lethal disease where, as the name implies, the entire crown, including the canopy of leaves and upper part of the trunk, which can weigh several tons, fails and drops from the top of the trunk with little or no warning. Hidden internal decay weakened the trunk until it could no longer support the crown. Although the fungus Thielaviopsis paradoxa has been isolated from Canary Island date palms that have failed due to sudden crown drop, it is unconfirmed that this pathogen is the primary cause of the disease. Other pathogens might be involved, either alone or in tandem with T. paradoxa . Hosts: Sudden crown drop primarily affects Canary Island date palms and, to a lesser extent, date palms. Symptoms and Biology: Unfortunately, no conspicuous symptoms of sudden crown drop occur. The canopy of leaves typically remains green and healthy and the outer layer of trunk tissue (pseudobark) appears normal and intact, making this disease extremely problematic to detect. However, internally hidden decay is destroying the trunk in a roughly hourglass shape, with the healthy tissue on the inside and the decayed tissue on the outside still within the intact pseudobark. Sufficient healthy tissue remains inside the trunk to maintain a normal-appearing canopy of leaves. Eventually, the healthy tissue in the “waist\" or constricted part of the hourglass is insufficient to support the weight above it, and the trunk fails, suddenly dropping the crown of leaves and attached portion of trunk. Although cultural factors, including drought stress, may promote disease development and severity in Canary Island date palms, the extensive use of chain saws to prune leaves and to shape and sculpt \"pineapples,\" the ball-like mass of persistent leaf bases just below the leaves, and especially to “skin” or “peel” trunks of old, persistent leaf bases can create gaping wounds that facilitate pathogen entry and onset of decay. Thus, annual screening or testing is essential for detection. Frequently pruned Canary Island date palms, especially those with a history of chain saw pruning, are the most susceptible to sudden crown drop. Look for palms with sculpted pineapples or, especially, skinned or peeled trunks below the leaves where the surface appears smooth, devoid of elliptic leaf base scars, or even straight-sided instead of round, sure indicators of past chain saw use. Not only can such severe pruning create entry sites for the pathogen, the typical position of such pruning, high up on the trunk where tissues have yet to attain anywhere near their maximum strength and resistance to decay, increases the likelihood of decay and crown drop. Management: Avoid pruning practices such as sculpting pineapples, and skinning or peeling trunks of old leaf bases, which typically create large wounds that facilitate pathogen entry. Thoroughly clean and disinfect all pruning tools prior to work on each palm by vigorously brushing them to remove sawdust and other particles. Disinfect the tools for 10 minutes in a 1:3 pine-oil-to-water solution, 1:1 solution of household bleach and water, or heat the saw blades for at least 10 seconds per side with a handheld butane torch. Clean and disinfect as described all tools used in the root zones of Canary Island date palms, such as shovels, spades, rakes, hoes, and weeders, which can spread the disease. For detection of sudden crown drop use a heavy rubber mallet or sturdy wooden stick to sound and listen for hidden decay in the upper part of the trunk. When sharply struck, healthy tissue emits a solid, sharp, resonating tone and the stick bounces back quickly. In contrast, decayed tissue emits a low, dull thud when sharply struck and the stick does not bounce back with much force. If sounding detects decayed tissue, then the area can be probed with a long, sharp, slender tool to determine extent of decay. If decay is extensive, the palm should be removed. Because a Canary Island date palm with sudden crown drop will eventually die and poses an extreme and imminent hazard, it is prudent to remove it as soon as possible following the same procedures outlined earlier under Fusarium wilt to prevent the spread of pathogens.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Olive knot disease on olive, Olea europaea, is distributed in olive-growing regions worldwide, and reports of the disease in California date back to the late 19th century. The disease is caused by Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. savastanoi (Psv), a bacterial pathogen that is spread short distances during the winter and spring rain events associated with California's Mediterranean climate. Consequently, in California, disease severity is greatest in the northern part of the state where heightened rainfall promotes disease development. Olive knot disease has become more common and serious during the past decade, in part due to increased plantings of the Manzanillo olive, a highly susceptible cultivar, and the introduction of super high-density olive plantings for oil production, a system where mechanized cultural practices can promote disease development.",

    "damagePestNote": "Galls produced as a result of infection by Psv can girdle and kill affected twigs. The death of infected shoots directly reduces yield; however, the disease also affects fruit size and quality. Flavor sensory tests have demonstrated that even trees with few galls can yield off-flavor fruit. The impact of the disease on yield, fruit size, and quality render olive knot of economic import to both commercial table olive growers and growers of olives for oil. Additionally, severe symptoms of olive knot detract from the aesthetics of olive trees used in commercial and private landscapes.",
    "managementPestNote": "Although olive knot disease generally is caused by Psv, it is important to note that olives also can become infected by a related bacterium, Pseudomonas savastanoi pv. nerii (Psvn). Both pathogens affect plants in the family Oleacae; however, Psvn is more commonly associated with knot formation on Nerium oleander, a disease referred to as oleander knot. While Psvn infects both oleander and olive, Psv infects only olive. The relative frequency of olive infections caused by Psvn in California is unknown. Effective management of both oleander knot and olive knot disease relies on reducing pathogen populations on the plant surface. Though commercial olive growers might utilize copper-based bacteriacides as a component of an integrated pest management program, products known to be effective aren't registered for use on backyard trees. Bacteriocidal compounds available to homeowners haven't been evaluated for efficacy in management of Psv . For the homeowner, a combination of cultural practices and sanitation is the most appropriate method of disease management. Exclusion For landscape plantings of olive, the primary defense against disease is pathogen exclusion. By planting disease-free nursery stock, a homeowner or commercial landscaper might avoid pathogen introduction into a landscape. When purchasing an olive tree, consider the potential for the plant to harbor latent infections. For example, purchasing a plant in winter heightens the potential for asymptomatic infections to evade observation. Gall formation can be complete by late spring, allowing for visual selection of uninfected plants. Sanitation and Cultural Practices Galls exude bacterial ooze during rain events; therefore, removing them from infected trees reduces the potential for disease spread. Because galls might form on small branches and twigs as well as large structural branches (scaffolds), tools ranging in size from small pruning shears to pruning saws might be needed to remove affected tissues from the tree. All tools should be routinely sterilized with a 10% bleach solution to prevent disease transmission both within and between trees. Galls shouldn't be removed during the winter and spring rainy season, because the resulting wounds can serve as new infection courts. Pruning wounds made in the dry summer months aren't susceptible to infection, thereby reducing the need to sanitize tools during summer pruning.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Oleander leaf scorch is a disease found mainly in southern California. It is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa, which is the same species (although a different strain) that causes Pierce's disease of grapevines and almond leaf scorch. The strain of X. fastidiosa that causes oleander leaf scorch will not cause Pierce's disease, so removing oleanders will not reduce the source of X. fastidiosa that can affect grapes. As with other diseases caused by X. fastidiosa, the bacterium is vectored by insects, primarily sharpshooters, which feed on the water-conducting tissue (xylem) of the plant. This disease was first noticed on oleanders in the Palm Springs-Indio area of Riverside County and in Tustin (Orange County) in the early 1990s and has spread to other parts of southern California including Santa Barbara, Ventura, San Diego, San Bernardino, and Los Angeles counties. Evidence to date suggests that the disease resulted from the introduction of a strain of X. fastidiosa new to California. The disease has now been reported across the southern United States. While the disease has not yet been recorded north of Santa Barbara County, it is believed that it could spread north through California's Central Valley and along the coast where the glassy-winged sharpshooter is established. Oleanders affected by this disease decline and then die, usually within 3 to 5 years of the first symptoms. There is no known cure.",

    "managementPestNote": "There is no known cure for oleander leaf scorch. Pruning out the part of the plant showing symptoms may help the appearance of the oleander tree or shrub but will not save the plant. The bacteria by then have already moved throughout the plant via the xylem, and limbs that show symptoms are only the first to become affected. Research indicates that some cultivars of oleander may express symptoms to lesser degrees than others and may live longer than other varieties when infected. Because of the year-round abundance of the glassy-winged sharpshooter, currently available insecticides are not effective in stopping the spread of the disease. The best management may be early removal of plants infected with the oleander leaf scorch bacteria to reduce the source of inoculum, but there are no experimental data to validate this method. Although only a few plant species have been tested as hosts of the oleander leaf scorch strain of X. fastidiosa, it is possible that other plant species may harbor the bacteria without showing disease symptoms.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Maintaining a healthy, vigorously growing lawn is the best way to prevent a severe disease outbreak in turfgrass. Each square foot of turf contains about 500 to 1,000 individual plants, each requiring optimum amounts of water and fertilizer, the right mowing regime, and an aerated, well-drained soil. If any of these factors are missing or in excess, the grass may become stressed and more susceptible to disease. For a disease to occur, all three sides of the “disease triangle” must be present (Fig. 1). Even if a disease-causing pathogen is present, infection won’t occur unless the environment (i.e., temperature, quantity of water, etc.) is conducive to disease development and susceptible grass is available. Selecting a turfgrass species that is adapted to the local climate and intended use, then following through with cultural practices that favor the grass rather than the pathogen, are important steps a home gardener can take to avoid severe lawn diseases. Many common diseases are active only under specific environmental conditions and will affect the lawn only for a short time. When the weather becomes more favorable to growth of the turfgrass, the lawn will often recover on its own if proper cultural practices are followed. However, if conditions and practices that favor disease are allowed to continue, the result can be long-term damage to the lawn that is difficult to recover from. Although we can’t control the weather, selecting the right grass and good cultural practices are keys to reducing disease. Fungicides are rarely needed for lawns when the right grass is planted and maintained correctly. IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM The cause of lawn damage is often difficult to identify, and diseases aren’t always the primary cause. It’s a good idea to inspect your lawn once a week to immediately identify problems and act quickly to determine the cause before it’s too late. Diseases tend to start off as small patches or spots of dying grasses that spread over time. If the damage is sudden, widespread, and severe, other pests or problems such as insects, pathogens, weeds, or environmental stress—such as too much or too little moisture or fertilizer—may be contributing to the observed symptoms. Damage that resembles disease symptoms may also result from incorrect watering, fertilizing, or mowing practices; damage from dog urine, herbicides, and other chemicals; poor drainage; compaction; vertebrate or insect damage; extremely high or low temperatures; competing vegetation; or thatch that is more than 1/2 inch thick. Irrigation problems are the most common cause of discolored lawns. Fixing broken sprinklers and conducting “catch can tests” to ensure even water coverage might be all that is necessary to improve the health and appearance of a lawn. (See the Irrigation section.) No amount of fungicide will control a problem that results from poor watering practices. Almost all lawn diseases are the result of pathogenic fungi that infect the blades, stems, or roots of turfgrass plants. Such diseases often are diagnosed by identifying symptoms of the disease and signs of the causal agent. Typical signs and symptoms include leaf spots; white, powdery growth; thin, open grass; and small to large areas of discolored or dying lawn. Visible parts of the pathogen (called signs)—such as whitish, cottony growth or small, hard, dormant structures (sclerotia)—are very useful in the identification process. Other typical symptoms of lawn diseases include “frog-eye” patterns (e.g., a circular area of dead grass with healthy grass in the center), leaf spots, rotted crowns and roots, yellow leaves, stunting, and wilting. Affected lawn areas can become discolored and lose density quickly.\tTable 1 lists and describes the most common diseases occurring in home lawns in California. See The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns for more information about how to manage lawns and diagnose problems. SELECTING A SUITABLE LAWN GRASS All types of turfgrass have positive and negative characteristics. There is no one perfect turfgrass suitable for all lawns. The type of grass you choose for your lawn should be compatible with your climate, anticipated use and maintenance level, and aesthetic desires; it also should have some resistance to common diseases. Cool-season grasses (e.g., bluegrasses, fescues, ryegrasses, etc.) perform best at daytime temperatures between 70° to 85°F. Warm-season grasses (e.g., bermudagrass, seashore paspalum, St. Augustinegrass, and zoysiagrass) perform best between 80° to 95°F. Often, diseases most impact grasses when they aren’t vigorously growing. Cool-season grass is more prone to disease infestations during the summer, while warm-season grasses are more prone to diseases in late fall through early spring. Make every effort to choose a grass that grows well in your conditions. For instance, too much shade causes stress that can lead to disease development. Similarly, some species are more heat- or drought-tolerant than others. New and improved cultivars of lawn grasses offering greater disease resistance, color, texture, density, and uniformity have been developed the past several years. Contact a reputable nursery or the UC Cooperative Extension office in your county for specific recommendations. Also see the publication Turfgrass Selection for the Home Landscape listed in References. CULTURAL PRACTICES TO REDUCE LAWN DISEASE To prevent lawn diseases, employ cultural practices that promote a dense, vigorous, actively growing grass with good recuperative ability. Good cultural practices include irrigation, fertilization, mowing, soil cultivation, and thatch removal. Table 1 outlines cultural practices that help prevent specific diseases. Irrigation Much of California has a Mediterranean climate characterized by rainfall in winter and spring and very little rain during summer and fall. Throughout the state, lawns require irrigation. It’s important to follow sound watering practices—whether watering by hand or using an automated system—to promote an environment favoring growth of the lawn rather than disease. Applying too much or not enough water can result in unhealthy, slow-growing grass that is vulnerable to pathogens. SAMPLING FOR COMMERCIAL LABORATORY DIAGNOSIS\tWhen a disease outbreak in a home lawn is suspected, the best course of action may be to seek the professional services of a plant disease diagnostic laboratory. Accurately identifying the problem before symptoms become severe allows for corrective action to be taken before there is an unnecessary loss of large lawn areas. Contact a nursery or your local UC Cooperative Extension office for a list of diagnostic laboratories.\tAn accurate diagnosis depends on the quality of the sample submitted, so the way a sample is taken is important. Collect entire grass plant samples— leaves, stems, roots, and soil —from several lawn areas that appear to exhibit different stages of the observed symptoms. It is a good idea to sample on the edge of an infected area, making sure to include plants that are just beginning to show symptoms. Remember that the pathogen isn’t always active in the part of the grass plant exhibiting disease symptoms, so be sure to include the entire plant. For example, symptoms observed in the foliage such as chlorosis (yellowing) or wilting could be associated with a vascular wilt or a root rot. Also, take samples from plants just beginning to show symptoms; often dead turf will be overrun with secondary fungi and bacteria that may be decomposing the dead turf, making accurate diagnosis difficult.\tPlace samples in a plastic bag and carefully label it. Placing a moist paper towel in the bag will help keep the samples as fresh as possible during transport. Don’t allow roots to dry out. Attach a written description of the type of lawn and symptoms you observed. Also include information on cultural management practices, any chemical applications that have been made, and any other relevant information that might be useful in making an accurate diagnosis as well as the date the sample was collected and your name and contact information.\tKeep the samples cool and moist, and submit them as soon as possible; refrigerate as necessary, but don’t freeze them. Sending the samples by Priority Mail or Next Day delivery is optimum.\tWaterlogged soils are poorly aerated, which restricts root growth, promotes some diseases, and allows algae and moss to thrive. In general, a deeply watered lawn develops a deeper and more extensive vertical root system, which provides it with greater drought and disease resistance than a shallowly watered lawn. Turfgrasses vary in water requirements. Warm-season turfgrasses are more drought-resistant than cool-season grasses and require about 20% less water. See Table 2 for information on how many minutes to water warm- and cool-season lawns each week in various parts of California, based on the output of the irrigation system or hose-end sprinkler. It is best to water the lawn thoroughly at longer intervals, until runoff just begins, rather than watering a little every day. The number of times to water each week depends on how long the irrigation system can run before water just starts to puddle or run off the soil surface. For example, if a grass needs 40 minutes of irrigation each week but runoff begins after 20 minutes, water twice a week for 20 minutes. In cases where soil takes up water so slowly that runoff occurs before 10 minutes, water cycling is necessary. To cycle, irrigate until runoff just begins, turn the system off, and repeat the process in 30 minutes before the soil surface dries out. Several cycles per day might be necessary to apply the desired amount of water. To determine sprinkler output, conduct “ catch can tests ” by setting small, empty, straight-sided, equal-sized containers such as tuna or cat food cans on top of your lawn every 10 to 15 feet between sprinkler heads operated by the same valve (Fig. 2) and run the system for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, turn off the system and measure the amount of water in each can with a ruler to determine the average amount of water per can. To find the average, add up the measurements from all the cans and divide this number by the number of cans used. Multiply this number by four to calculate the sprinkler output rate per hour. Compare this number to the outputs listed in Table 2 to determine how many minutes you need to irrigate weekly. Conducting can tests regularly also is useful for determining how evenly irrigation water is distributed over the area watered and allows for sprinkler head misalignments and other mechanical problems to be discovered and corrected. The best time to water is early in the morning, when evaporation rates are lowest and water pressure is at its peak. Irrigating in the afternoon is wasteful because of higher evaporation rates; also, prolonged damp conditions in the evening can encourage disease development. Remember that irrigation requirements change from month to month and irrigation might not be needed at all if it has rained. Reset your sprinkler system to meet your lawn’s changing irrigation needs. Fertilization Applying the correct amount of fertilizer is an important aspect of maintaining a healthy, dense lawn with good disease resistance. Fertilization influences turfgrass growth, which in turn influences the recuperative ability of stressed grass. All turfgrasses require nitrogen, and certain sites may also require other nutrients, including iron, on a regular basis. Applying too much nitrogen, especially in a highly soluble, fast-release form, can result in excessive, succulent leaf and stem growth, leading to increased opportunities for fungal penetration that might result in diseases such as brown patch, Pythium blight, and leaf spot. Over-fertilized lawns also require more frequent mowing and watering. Conversely, lawns grown under nitrogen-deficient conditions are prone to dollar spot, rust, and red thread diseases. For moderate, even growth, apply a total of 4 to 6 pounds of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet of lawn area annually. Avoid applying more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per application. Sandy soils require the same amount of nitrogen as clay soils, but apply it at lower rates and more frequently. Fertilizer should be applied during the active growing season of the grass, which generally is during spring and summer for warm-season grasses and during fall and spring for cool-season lawns. Mowing Maintaining a lawn at the recommended mowing height will improve its ability to resist diseases and give it greater aesthetic appeal. The frequency with which the lawn is mowed should be based on the growth rate of the grass. Lawns should be mowed often enough so that no more than one-third the length of the grass blade is removed at any time. Removing too much of the grass blade can increase the susceptibility to several diseases by depleting food reserves in the plant, making it difficult for the plant to recover from stress and injury. Repeated scalping kills or greatly reduces the vigor of a turfgrass. Maintain sharp mower blades to avoid mechanical damage to turf. When grass is mowed regularly, clippings can be left on the lawn, a practice called “grasscycling.” Grasscycling hasn’t been found to significantly increase thatch or disease incidence. For additional information, see Mowing Your Lawn and “Grass­cycling” listed in References . Soil Cultivation and Thatch Removal Soil compaction reduces root growth as well as recuperative ability, thus increasing a lawn’s relative susceptibility to diseases. Soil cultivation, such as coring or aerification, will improve shoot and root growth and recuperative ability while decreasing the likelihood of disease and insect damage. Cultivation should be done during times when the grass is growing vigorously and can take advantage of the reduction in soil compaction (spring and fall for cool-season turf and early summer for warm-season grass). Thatch is a partially decomposed layer comprised of roots, stems, rhizomes, crowns, and stolons above the soil surface. Up to 1/2 inch of thatch is beneficial: it provides insulation to roots, reduces soil water evaporation, cushions playing surfaces, and can prevent soil compaction. However, thatch layers greater than 1/2 inch should be removed to avoid restricting water entry into the root zone. Several turfgrass pathogens can survive in the thatch layer, including those that cause summer patch, leaf spot, and melting-out diseases. Heavy thatch may also lead to fairy ring problems. Bermudagrass, Kentucky bluegrass, and kikuyugrass produce more thatch than most other turfgrasses and require regular dethatching. Equipment rental businesses often carry dethatching (verticutting) machines that are specifically designed to remove thatch from home lawns. The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns provides additional information on how to choose turfgrass species as well as how to irrigate, fertilize, and manage your lawn to prevent disease. Table 1.

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Fire blight development is influenced primarily by seasonal weather. When temperatures of 75° to 85°F are accompanied by intermittent rain or hail, conditions are ideal for disease development. The succulent tissue of rapidly growing trees is especially vulnerable; thus excess nitrogen fertilization and heavy pruning, which promote such growth, should be avoided. Trees shouldn’t be irrigated during bloom. Monitor trees regularly, and remove and destroy fire blight infections. (See Removing Diseased Wood.) If fire blight has been a problem in the past, apply blossom sprays. Sprays prevent new infections but won’t eliminate wood infections; these must be pruned out. In years when weather conditions are very conducive to fire blight development, it can be difficult if not impossible to control the disease. Choosing Tolerant Varieties Most pear tree varieties, including Asian pears (with the exception of Shinko) and red pear varieties, are very susceptible to fire blight. Varieties of ornamental pear trees that are less susceptible to fire blight are Bradford, Capitol, and Red Spire; Aristocrat is highly susceptible. Among the more susceptible apple varieties are Fuji, Gala, Golden Delicious, Granny Smith, Gravenstein, Jonathan, Mutsu, Pink Lady, and Yellow Newtown. Wherever possible, plant varieties less prone to fire blight damage. Because most infections originate in the flowers, trees that bloom late or throughout the season (i.e., rat-tail bloom) often have severe fire blight damage. Removing Diseased Wood Successful removal of fire blight infections is done in summer or winter when the bacteria no longer are spreading through the tree. At these times infections have ceased enlarging, canker margins are clearly visible, and cleaning pruning shears is unnecessary. Rapidly advancing infections on very susceptible trees (pear, Asian pear, and some apple varieties) should be removed as soon as they appear in spring. In these cases, dipping shears in 10% bleach between cuts might be wise. However, the location of the cut is far more important than the cleansing of tools. New infections that originate at pruning cuts haven’t been observed on orchard trees; instead, the greater risk is “short cutting,” wherein the cut isn’t made far enough below the canker to remove all the infected tissue. To locate the correct cutting site, find the lower edge of the visible infection in the branch, trace that infected branch back to its point of attachment, and cut at the next branch juncture down without harming the branch collar. This will remove the infected branch and the branch to which it is attached. If a fire blight infection occurs on a trunk or major limb, the wood often can be saved by scraping off the bark down to the cambium layer in infected areas (i.e., removing both the outer and inner bark). When scraping, look for long, narrow infections that can extend beyond the margin of the canker or infection site. If any are detected, remove all discolored tissue plus 6 to 8 inches more beyond the infection. This procedure is best done in winter when trees are dormant and bacteria aren’t active in the tree. Don’t apply any dressing to the wound. If the limb has been girdled, scraping won’t work, and the whole limb must be removed. Chemical Control Copper products are the only materials available to homeowners for fire blight control, and they often don’t provide adequate control even with multiple applications. A very weak (about 0.5%) Bordeaux mixture or other copper product applied several times as blossoms open might reduce new infections but won’t eliminate all new infections or those already existing in wood. The spray must be applied to open blossoms; thus the number of applications needed depends on the length of the bloom period. Once blossoms begin to open, make the first application when the average temperature (average of the maximum and minimum temperatures for a 24-hour period) exceeds 60°F. Apply at four- to five-day intervals during periods of high humidity and until late bloom is over. For pear trees, this might mean five to 12 applications per season. Copper products also might cause russeting or scarring of the fruit surface. The risk of this damage begins during bloom and increases as fruits enlarge.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74132.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "In the field, garden, or planter box, seedlings often fail to come up, or die soon after they have emerged from the soil. Seeds may rot before they germinate, shoots may be decayed before they emerge, or stems of seedlings may be attacked near the soil line, causing young plants to collapse. These diseases often are collectively referred to as “damping-off,” and may be caused by a number of soil-inhabiting pathogens. Species of the soil organism Pythium are most often responsible for damping-off, but several other pathogens, including species of Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, and Phytophthora, can also cause decay. Decay is most likely to occur when old seeds or seed pieces are planted in cold wet soil, and is further increased by poor soil drainage, the use of green compost, and planting too deeply. SYMPTOMS The first evidence of damping-off or seed piece decay (as in potatoes) is the failure of some plants to emerge. If seeds are attacked before they germinate, they become soft and mushy, turn dark brown, and decay. They may have a layer of soil clinging to them when they are dug up because the soil is interwoven with fine, threadlike fungus growth. Germinating seedlings shrivel and may darken. If seedlings are attacked after they emerge, stem tissue near the soil line is decayed and weakened, usually causing plants to topple and die. When only roots are decayed, plants may continue standing but remain stunted, wilt and eventually die. As seedlings get older, they become less susceptible to damping-off pathogens. SIMILAR INJURY Garden pests such as cutworms, earwigs, flea beetles, snails and slugs, and root maggots may also damage seedlings in the garden. It’s important to distinguish the damage done by pests from damping-off injury.\tCutworms are dull-brownish, smooth-skinned caterpillars that emerge from the soil at night to feed on newly emerged seedlings and newly set transplants. They are called “cutworms” because they frequently snip plants off at or just below the soil surface. Look for cutoff plants, and dig around the base of injured plants to look for cutworms.\tEarwigs feed most actively at night, and can cause substantial damage to seedling plants. Damaged seedlings may be missing all or parts of their leaves and stem.\tFlea beetles are small, shiny beetles with large hind legs used for jumping. They are common in newly planted vegetable gardens, and may seriously damage seedlings by chewing dozens of holes in leaves or removing leaves completely. Feeding by large numbers of beetles gives leaves a shot-hole appearance and slows plant growth.\tSnails and slugs are most active at night and on cloudy or foggy days. Snails and slugs chew irregular holes with smooth edges in leaves, and can clip succulent plant parts and seedlings. Look for the silvery mucous trails to confirm damage was caused by slugs or snails and not damping-off pathogens or other causes.\tRoot maggots are small, legless, and white. Look for their brown pupal cases in or around damaged seeds or seedlings. Seedcorn maggots infest newly sprouted seed before plants can emerge. Cabbage maggots attack older plants, riddling roots with tunnels.\tBIOLOGY The pathogens that cause damping-off and seed piece decay are present in virtually all soils. They survive on dead organic matter and also produce spores or other structures that survive for long periods of time. The young tissue of emerging seedlings is least resistant to infection when plants are growing slowly in cold, wet soil. Vigorously growing seedlings are fairly resistant to infection. Damping-off pathogens can be divided into two main groups. The “true fungi” include Rhizoctonia, Fusarium, and Thielaviopsis genera. A second group, previously considered fungi but now placed in a separate classification called oomycetes, includes the Pythium and Phytophthora genera.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Damping-off is controlled primarily through good sanitation, high quality planting material, and proper cultural and environmental controls. Damping-off is worse when soil is wet or compacted. Prepare planting beds so that the soil has good drainage. Drainage can be improved by using raised beds and soil amendments such as redwood shavings, peat moss, or fir bark. Use only well-decomposed compost. The overly moist environment of green compost will encourage a damping-off problem. Use aerobic (well aerated) composting procedures to reduce the population of disease-causing pathogens in the compost. Composted hardwood bark has been reported to reduce damping-off. Plant when temperatures are favorable for rapid seedling growth. Shallow planting will speed up germination outdoors if conditions are marginal. Planting too deeply can delay germination and emergence of the seedling and increase damping-off problems. If you want to start seedlings before temperatures are favorable, start them in the greenhouse or other protected areas and transplant them into the field when temperatures get warmer. Do not transplant into cold, wet soil. Use only the highest quality seed available. Use light sprinkler irrigations to encourage germination and emergence, and do not overwater. After plants emerge, thin them so that there is good air circulation among the plants. Avoid putting on too much nitrogen fertilizer. Avoid planting the same crops in the same place year after year. Potatoes are a special case. If growing potatoes, plant seed pieces in moist soil that is at least 50° F, and start them at a time of year when irrigations will not be necessary before sprouts emerge from the ground. Sanitation Sanitation is important because spores of the organisms that cause damping-off can survive in dust, planting medium, or soil particles in flats and pots. To reduce survival of the pathogens, remove and discard diseased plants and sterilize containers. If starting plants indoors, in cold frames, or in greenhouses, plant seeds in steam treated soil or pasteurized potting mix. You can purchase treated potting soil or prepare your own. Soil mix must be held at 140° F for at least 30 minutes. Soil can be heated in a conventional or microwave oven in a paper bag, by raising the temperature with boiling water, or by placing moist soil in a clear plastic bag in direct sunlight. Use a soil thermometer to make sure soil reaches the proper temperature for the correct time. For outdoor planting beds, in the warmer regions of California, soil solarization during fallow periods can reduce pathogens. To solarize, place clear plastic tarps over moist, bare soil for 4 to 6 weeks during the hottest part of the year.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Armillaria root rot is a disease of trees and woody plants, although it also affects palms, succulents, ferns and other herbaceous plants. This disease is caused by fungi in the genus Armillaria, also known as “oak root fungus,” although the fungus has no specificity for oaks. Several species of Armillaria are known to occur in California, but Armillaria mellea is the species commonly found in home gardens, parks, vineyards, tree crops, and natural landscapes. This pathogen has a broad host range, potentially affecting thousands of ornamental and crop plants. Other species of Armillaria occur in forests, causing heart rot and acting as saprophytes. The oak root fungus attacks and kills the vascular cambium (the tissue that generates bark and wood) in woody roots, then spreads laterally to the main stem, which can girdle the base of the trunk and kill the entire tree. Armillaria is also a white rot wood decay fungus which destroys the strength of wood in roots and at the base of infected tree trunks, thereby increasing the likelihood of tree failure. This dual nature of Armillaria, both as a pathogen (killing the living tissues in a tree) and a saprobe (living on dead or non-functional wood after the infected host dies), presents a challenge to management because its inoculum (infective tissue or propagules) can persist for decades below ground as mycelium (vegetative fungal tissue) living in partially-decayed woody roots (residual roots) long after the infected host plants have died or were removed.",

    "damagePestNote": "The first and most obvious symptom of Armillaria root rot may be decline or death of a tree or woody plant. Often, death occurs so rapidly that the leaves turn brown, but don’t yet fall off the tree. Sometimes this decline may be slower, characterized by dieback of shoot tips over the course of months or even years. Armillaria infects woody plants and destroys their vascular cambium and the underlying root wood. The pathogen can also attack non-woody monocots and some herbaceous plant tissues. The infection typically begins when plant roots grow into direct contact with infected residual roots. Although the mushrooms release wind-dispersed spores, these are not a common means of infection. After the cambium has been killed and the underlying root wood has been invaded, a mycelial fan usually grows to colonize the main stem, where it may continue to invade other roots or move up and around the root collar. Where the cambium of the main stem or large roots has been destroyed by the fungus, the formation of new wood and bark ceases, and a flat lesion on the surface of the bark (visible as an external canker) develops—these are the best places to look for mycelial fans under the bark, especially on trees that have canopy symptoms. Other visible symptoms at the surface include flat cankers on the trunk or main stem near the ground, flat surfaces on an otherwise round stem, cracking bark, and bleeding sap (gummosis, common in Prunus species). With continued destruction of its roots, a tree loses its ability to conduct water, and symptoms of decline begin to appear in the canopy. Canopy symptoms include leaf wilting, defoliation, twig and branch dieback, and thinning out. Development of canopy symptoms may be gradual, over the course of years. The course of symptom development likely depends on the progress and pace of infection. When disease progress is slow, initial symptoms may be subtle: defoliation at the top of the tree or plant may be the sole indication, sometimes accompanied by increasing proportion of dead twigs (thinning out). In some cases, early leaf loss or dormancy and leaf color changes are also possible. By the time canopy symptoms appear, it is very likely that mycelial fans are well developed under the bark low on the trunk, on the large roots, or both.",
    "managementPestNote": "Prevention There are no known cultivars or varieties of plants that are completely immune to Armillaria root rot, and some plant plants are very susceptible to the pathogen. For example, peach (Prunus\tpersica and related Prunus hybrids) and Peruvian pepper (Schinus molle) are highly susceptible. Susceptible plants should not be planted in landscapes where trees have died from Armillaria root rot, especially when large dead roots may remain in the soil. Reducing tree stress and ensuring good tree condition are the principal beneficial practices in preventing rapid decline. Although A. mellea is considered highly virulent, most deaths of infected trees in California landscapes can be attributed to excessive irrigation or other stresses. Avoid physical damage to roots, soil compaction in the root zone, and addition of soil on top of the existing grade (especially during construction). Most importantly, prevent the waterlogging of soils around trees from excessive or inappropriate irrigation, especially in summer. Do not irrigate trees that are mature, established, and have never been irrigated. Excessive irrigation can be especially common for drought-adapted trees planted in lawns. In such cases, it is preferable to maintain a mulched turf-free zone out to the dripline of each tree, if possible, and allow the soil under the tree to dry out between irrigations. Cultural and Biological Control In a landscape with plants known or suspected to be infected, the principal cultural management strategy involves carefully regulating irrigation. Immediately correct any over-watering and poor soil drainage, and, during the warm summer months, ensure that the root collar of trees stays dry (i.e., do not set up the sprinkler to hit the base of the trunk). This is especially important for native California oaks, which evolved in the absence of summer water. Remove from the nearby landscape (and do not establish) any plants that require a lot of water (e.g., annual flowers). Deeply planted trees or trees with soil covering the root collar area are often more susceptible. Research indicates that root collar excavations can limit development of existing infections and possibly even prevent infections. Using hand tools or compressed air excavators, remove the soil from the base of infected trees to expose the large structural roots and the root flare. Never use construction machinery that may wound the root collar or roots. The bark needs to be kept undamaged and intact in such excavations. Although there is no biological control product registered for use against Armillaria root rot, it is clear from studies that multiple naturally occurring soilborne fungi attack Armillaria and likely limit its effects in landscapes and in natural ecosystems worldwide. Trichoderma is a common fungus present in mulches and wherever woody materials occur in landscapes. Trichoderma readily colonizes small pieces of wood (such as wood chips in mulch), where it can also colonize Armillaria that might be present. This effect, however, is not reliably observed in large pieces of wood, so removing, grinding, or chipping stumps and large dead roots may be beneficial in two ways: by reducing the overall Armillaria inoculum in the landscape (removal of large roots for decay by the fungus) and by facilitating Trichoderma attack on Armillaria (chipping and grinding the wood increases its surface area for greater attack by Trichoderma). In addition, because Trichoderma growth is stimulated by higher soil temperatures and dry soil (both of which inhibit Armillaria), soil solarization could be beneficial, by simultaneously damaging Armillaria present in the soil and stimulating the growth of Trichoderma. Soil solarization may not affect deep roots, stumps, or large buried roots at depths below approximately 4 inches, so excavation and removal of residual roots will be the best method of minimizing disease risk. There may be some advantage to planting trees in large holes amended with fresh organic matter. The soil disturbance from making a large hole and the organic matter amendment both facilitate Trichoderma attack of Armillaria . Be sure to add nitrogen fertilizers if fresh organic matter is added to soil. Also, be careful that drainage is adequate to allow for decomposition of the organic matter. Although adding organic matter to planting pits is usually not recommended, the practice may have value in landscapes or gardens where Armillaria root rot has killed other trees in the past. Chemical Control There are no registered fungicides for Armillaria control in California for several reasons. Fungicide delivery to Armillaria is difficult since mycelial fans are hidden under the bark and enclosed in a protective envelope; rhizomorphs have a protective rind on the outside; and initial infection occurs in soil where fungicide efficacy is easily reduced by microbial activity. Armillaria ’s ability to persist in dead wood means that any fungicide would need to be applied repeatedly.",

Defoliation follows severe, early leaf infection. Late-season infections generally can be tolerated in backyard trees, because peeling the fruit will remove the pinpoint-sized scab lesions.",
    "managementPestNote": "Several techniques are available for controlling scab. Advantages of one method over another depend on the number of trees you are managing and whether conditions are ideal for disease development. Cultural Control For a single, backyard tree, removing—then composting or destroying—its dropped leaves in autumn or winter can limit the disease to tolerable levels. In plantings of several trees, additional steps might be necessary to effectively control this disease, especially in cool, moist coastal areas. These include applying zinc and fertilizer-grade urea (or some other nitrogen source) to leaves in autumn to hasten leaf fall and adding lime to leaf piles beneath the tree. In pears, apply urea by itself, because zinc can be phytotoxic. If you are using sprinklers that wet any of the tree’s foliage, irrigate between sunrise and noon to allow adequate drying time, or reduce the angle of the sprinkler. Disease-resistant Cultivars Table 1 lists the relative susceptibility of different apple varieties to apple scab. Major breeding efforts for disease resistance are ongoing in New York, where Enterprise, Liberty, Prima, Priscilla, and many newer varieties appear to be resistant to scab. Scab-resistant crabapples also are available. European pear cultivars with negligible scab risk include Arganche, Barnett Perry, Batjarka, Brandy, Erabasma, Harrow Delight, Muscat, Orcas, and Passe Crassane. Because Asian pears (Pyrus pyrifolia) are a different species, they are less susceptible to scab than European pears (P. communis).\nTABLE 1.

Fungicide applications require careful attention to timing, as preventing early infection is the most important step toward successfully controlling later fruit infections. It is difficult to prevent secondary fruit infections once primary infections occur. Unlike peach leaf curl, treatments for scab made when trees are completely dormant aren’t effective and aren’t recommended. If treatments are needed, the generally recommended time is between when buds begin to break and a month after petal fall. If rain threatens, it is important to apply a fungicide as soon as you see the tips of the leaves emerge. A second application might be needed 10 to 14 days later if it is still rainy, once you can see blossom clusters but before they have opened. If rainy weather continues, apply a third spray toward the end of the bloom period, when most of the petals have fallen. The surfaces of the fruit and foliage become more resistant to infection as the season progresses, although extended wet, foggy weather can lead to an infection period due to secondary spores that develop on leaves and fruit. If no scab infections are evident 1 month after petal fall, secondary infections probably won’t be a problem, and fungicide sprays can stop. However, continue to watch for pinpoint scab symptoms, especially if late rains occur. Several fungicides are available for controlling apple and pear scab. These include fixed copper, Bordeaux mixtures, copper soaps (copper octanoate), sulfur, mineral or neem oils, and myclobutanil. All these products except myclobutanil are considered organically acceptable. Generally copper or Bordeaux sprays should be used only from green tip to full bloom. Later applications increase the risk of fruit russetting, a chemical burning of the fruit skin, although in some years this occurs even if you’ve used these materials only before full bloom. Fixed copper products include Lilly Miller Kop-R-Spray concentrate and Monterey Liqui-Cop. Bordeaux mixture is a combination of copper sulfate and hydrated lime that must be mixed just before application. For more information about how to prepare this fungicide, see Pest Notes: Bordeaux Mixture . You can apply wettable sulfur through bloom and early fruit set. When using sulfur-containing compounds such as wettable sulfur, never apply them within 3 weeks of an oil application or when temperatures are near or higher than 90°F. Bordeaux has a narrower application time frame than other sulfur-containing products, because it contains copper, and shouldn’t be applied after full bloom. Myclobutanil (Spectracide Immunox Multipurpose Fungicide Spray Concentrate) is a synthetic fungicide that is effective against apple scab. You can apply it any time from green tip until after petal fall.",

    "managementPestNote": "With careful management, some cultivars of susceptible landscape plants can be aesthetically pleasing despite the presence of anthracnose. For new plantings, choose cultivars that are resistant to anthracnose-causing fungi, and space the plants far enough apart to maximize air circulation and increase sunlight. Some pesticides are available to prevent anthracnose infections, but they don’t reliably control the disease. Preventative treatments have been shown to work best on Modesto ash; see the section on Chemical Control. Once symptoms develop or become severe in a growing season, anthracnose can’t be effectively controlled. Environmental factors also play an important role in managing anthracnose. Monitor current conditions such as rain and irrigation to determine if either favors anthracnose development. Dry spring weather could mean that disease management isn’t necessary. A wet spring or an irrigation system that wets the foliage could result in a disease outbreak that might warrant using control measures. Resistant Varieties Avoid planting highly susceptible species including Modesto ash (Fraxinus velutina ‘Modesto’), American sycamore (Platanus occidentalis), and some cultivars of the London plane tree (Platanus x hispanica). California sycamore (Platanus racemosa) is very susceptible to anthracnose which disfigures the tree, giving it a twisted appearance. Trees usually survive these attacks but may lose apical control temporarily, resulting in increased lateral growth and decreased height. Among ash trees, the cultivars Moraine, Raywood, and the Evergreen Ash (Shamel) are more resistant to anthracnose than others. For Chinese elm, plant the more resistant Drake cultivar instead of True Green or Evergreen. Table 1 shows the relative susceptibility of some landscape trees to anthracnose. When planting London plane, also called plane tree, decide whether anthracnose or powdery mildew resistance is more needed based on prevailing environmental conditions at that site and the planned pruning method; see Cultural Practices. For instance, the Bloodgood London plane tree cultivar is resistant to the fungus that causes anthracnose but not to the fungus that causes powdery mildew. On the other hand, the anthracnose-susceptible cultivar Yarwood is resistant to powdery mildew. Cultural Practices Pruning. Prune and destroy or bury infected leaves, twigs, and branches during fall or winter. Severe pruning of larger diameter branches is not a good practice for most trees, because it triggers bushy watersprouts, which are poorly attached to the trunk and are susceptible to diseases such as powdery mildew. To stimulate vigorous growth of severely infected trees, fertilize after the leaves open and spring rains have stopped. Avoid irrigation systems that wet leaves. Sanitation . Rake and dispose of fallen leaves and twigs during the growing season and in fall. Prune during winter to increase air circulation in the canopy and remove the previous season’s dead and diseased twigs and branches. When planting, space the plants far enough apart to maximize air circulation and increase sunlight, both of which facilitate faster drying of leaf surfaces when trees are fully grown. Sycamores are often pollarded. Pollarding is a practice where trees are severely pruned to remove all of the previous year’s growth. Pollarding isn’t recommended for most trees but can be useful for London plane trees to control anthracnose since the practice removes all pathogen-infected shoots. However, pollarding increases susceptibility of London plane trees to powdery mildew because it stimulates the growth of new shoots and foliage. If you wish to annually pollard London plane trees, the cultivar Yarwood is a good choice, because it is highly resistant to powdery mildew. Chemical Control Several fungicides are available that provide varying degrees of anthracnose control on Modesto ash. Fungicides can protect only healthy tissue and don’t eradicate existing infections. Complete spray coverage and timing are crucial in preventing the disease. Thoroughly spray all new growth as buds begin to open in spring. Apply pesticides before rainy periods. If no rains are predicted, you can delay this application. If moist weather prevails, additional applications may be required at intervals of about 2 weeks to protect new growth. The most effective fungicides for control are the protective fungicides containing chlorothalonil e.g., Daconil), copper sprays containing copper diammonia diacetate (e.g., Liquicop), propiconazole (e.g., Banner Maxx II), and the systemic fungicide thiophanate-methyl (e.g., Cleary’s 3336, for professional use only). Chlorothalonil and thiophanate-methyl offer the greatest control in Modesto ash. Always follow label directions. Complete coverage of large, tall trees is difficult to achieve; spraying is not very efficient and might not be justified or feasible. While control might occur in some situations, anthracnose can return annually and warrant a continued, preventative spray program. Fungicide applications for anthracnose control generally work well on ash but their efficacy has not been proven on other species in California.\tTable 1.

    "managementPestNote": "Zoropsis spiders are harmless and control of them is unnecessary. The ones you encounter will be wandering adults so there is little you can do to prevent them from showing up in your home. If you feel you must do something, general spider preventive measures include reducing the clutter around your home, which eliminates hiding places that spiders find attractive. Adding weather-stripping around the base of doors will help keep spiders and insects from entering your home. It is unlikely that you will encounter more than one of these spiders at once; Zoropsis spiders do not appear in groups or invade in large numbers. Capturing and placing the spider outside will probably end your arachnid encounter and will not increase the probability of running into the spider later on. You can remove a spider from your home by placing a jar over it and slipping a piece of paper under the jar so that it seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up.",

Some social wasps are predators for most or all of the year and provide a great benefit by killing large numbers of plant-feeding insects and nuisance flies; others are exclusively scavengers.

Wasps become a problem only when they threaten to sting humans. In California, yellowjackets are the primary pests among the social wasps.",
    "damagePestNote": "Concern about yellowjackets is based on their persistent, pugnacious behavior around food sources and their aggressive defense of their colony. Usually stinging behavior is encountered at nesting sites, but sometimes scavenging yellowjackets will sting if someone tries to swat them away from a potential food source. When scavenging at picnics or other outdoor meals, wasps will crawl into soda cans and can sting your lips or the inside of your mouth or throat. Reactions to wasp stings vary from only short-term, intense sensations to substantial swelling and tenderness, some itching, or life-threatening allergic responses. These reactions are discussed in detail in Pest Notes: Bee and Wasp Stings. Of specific concern is a condition that results from multiple-sting encounters, sometimes unfamiliar to attending health professionals, that is induced by the volume of foreign protein injected and the tissue damage caused by destructive enzymes in wasp venom. Red blood cells and other tissues in the body become damaged, and tissue debris and other breakdown products are carried to the kidneys, to be eliminated from the body. Too much debris and waste products can cause blockages in the kidneys, resulting in renal insufficiency or renal failure. Patients in this condition require medical intervention, which can include dialysis.",
    "managementPestNote": "Most social wasps provide an extremely beneficial service by eliminating large numbers of other pest insects through predation and should be protected and encouraged to nest in areas of little human or animal activity. Although many animals prey on social wasps—including birds, reptiles, amphibians, skunks, bears, raccoons, spiders, praying mantids, and bald-faced hornets—none provides satisfactory biological control in home situations. The best way to prevent unpleasant encounters with social wasps is to avoid them. If you know where they are, try not to go near their nesting places. Wasps can become very defensive when their nest is disturbed. Be on the lookout for nests when outdoors. Wasps that are flying directly in and out of a single location are probably flying to and from their nest. Usually, scavenging wasps won’t become a problem if there is no food around to attract them. When nuisance wasps are present outdoors, keep foods including pet food and drinks covered or inside the house, and keep garbage in tightly sealed garbage cans. Once wasps discover food, they will continue to hunt around that location long after the source has been removed. If wasp nests must be eliminated, it is easiest and safest to call for professional help. In some areas of California, personnel from a local mosquito and vector control district may be available to remove nests. To determine if this service is available in your area, call the Mosquito & Vector Control Association of California at (916) 440-0826. If a rapid solution to a severe yellow­jacket problem is essential, seek the assistance of a professional pest control operator or consider installing bait stations. Trapping Wasps Trapping is one method that can be employed to try to reduce yellowjacket problems. Trapping isn’t suggested for other social wasp species. Lure traps The easiest to use are lure traps, which are available for purchase at many retail stores that sell pest control supplies. Lure traps can help reduce the number of localized foraging workers, but they don’t eliminate large populations. Lure traps contain a chemical that attracts yellow­jackets into the traps, but the common lure in traps, heptyl butyrate, attracts primarily the western yellowjacket and not other species. Meat such as chicken can be added as an attractant and is believed to improve catches of the German yellowjacket and V. vulgaris. Replace meat frequently, because yellowjackets aren’t attracted to rotting meat. Also, periodically check the trap to remove trapped yellowjackets and make sure workers are still attracted to the trap. Lures need to be replaced periodically; follow trap directions regarding replacement. To reduce the number of yellowjackets foraging in specific areas such as patios, picnic tables, concession stands, and Dumpsters, place lure traps with hepytl butyrate around the periphery. In large areas such as parks, place traps about 200 feet from the area to be protected and about every 150 feet along the circumference. In backyards, place them along the edge of the property line as far away from the patio or other protected area as possible. To intercept foraging yellowjackets, it is important to place the traps between the area to be protected and the native landscapes serving as nesting sites. Typically yellowjackets will forage about 1/4 mile. Water traps Water traps generally are homemade and consist of a 5-gallon bucket, string, and protein bait such as turkey, ham, fish, or liver. Fill the bucket with soapy water, and suspend the protein bait 1 to 2 inches above the water. A wide mesh screen over the bucket will help prevent other animals from reaching and consuming the bait. After the yellowjacket removes the protein, the yellowjacket flies down and becomes trapped in the water and drowns. Like the lure trap, these traps also work best as queen traps in late winter to early spring. In summer and fall they might assist in reducing localized foraging workers but usually not to acceptable levels. Place water traps away from patio or picnic areas, so wasps aren’t attracted to your food as well. Bait Stations In the past, poison bait products were available to reduce yellowjacket populations later in the season when their prey is no longer available and some species turn to scavenging. However, reliable products were taken off the market in the early 2000s. Esfenvalerate products that recently became available haven’t been shown to be effective in research trials. Discouraging or Eliminating Nests Early in the season, simply knocking down newly started paper wasp nests will cause the founding female to go elsewhere to start again or to join a neighboring nest as a worker. As there is little activity around newly started wasp nests, they are very difficult to find. Wasps are more likely to be noticed after nests and populations grow. Nest removal for controlling subterranean or cavity-dwelling yellowjackets isn’t practical, because the nests are underground or otherwise inaccessible. Nest Sprays Aerosol formulations of insecticides labeled for use on wasp and hornet nests can be effective against yellowjackets and paper wasps, but the products must be used with extreme caution. Wasps will attack if they sense a poison being applied to their nests, and even the freeze-type products aren’t guaranteed to stop all wasps that come flying out. It is prudent to wear protective clothing that covers the entire body, including a veil over your face and gloves. In addition, you need to wear protective eyewear and other clothing to protect yourself from pesticide hazards. Wasps are most likely to be in the nest at night, but even after dark and using formulations that shoot an insecticide stream up to 20 feet, stinging incidents are likely. Underground nests can be quite a distance from the visible entrance, and the spray might not get back far enough to hit the wasps. Partially intoxicated, agitated wasps are likely to be encountered at some distance from the nest entrance, even the day after an insecticidal treatment. Hiring a pest control professional will reduce risks to you and your family; in some areas of California, this service might be available through your local mosquito and vector control district.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7407.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "The names “wood wasp” and “horntail” describe several kinds of wood-boring insects in the order Hymenoptera, family Siricidae. Of greatest concern are the large, nonstinging wasps that normally are attracted to and complete their life cycles in newly dead or dying conifer trees. Timber salvaged from these trees can be processed into infested lumber. This can lead to adult wasps emerging in recently completed buildings or structures. Although these insects are extremely annoying, they aren’t harmful to humans or structures. They attack only trees and won’t bore into wood in buildings or furniture. See the Pest Note: Wood-boring Beetles in the Home for information on borers that will attack furniture or structures. IDENTIFICATION The dozen species of wood wasps in California, Oregon, and Washington look similar. They are large insects, generally 1 inch or longer, and wasplike in appearance but have an elongated, cylindrical body without a noticeable constriction or “waist.” They often are black or metallic dark blue or combinations of black, red, and yellow. They make a noisy buzz when flying. The male and female have a similar body shape, except the female is larger and has a long egg-laying apparatus (ovipositor) that can exceed her body length. The female can use her ovipositor only for egg laying; she can’t use it to sting in defense. Although these pests can chew through wood, they don’t bite people. LIFE CYCLE A female wood wasp drills her ovipositor nearly 3/4 inch into the wood of a weakened or dying tree and lays 1 to 7 eggs. At the same time, she squirts in a fungus from her abdominal gland. She continues this process, laying up to 200 eggs. Eggs hatch in 3 to 4 weeks, and larvae tunnel into the fungus-predigested wood parallel with the grain. Larvae are legless, cylindrical, whitish, and have a spine at the tip of their last abdominal segment. As they chew, larvae use a spine at the tip of their abdomen to help push themselves forward, through the wood. Larvae begin eating the softer wood (sapwood) just beneath the bark, following the fungus into the heartwood, then return to the sapwood to complete their feeding. Larval feeding continues through 5 or more immature stages, which take at least a year and as many as 5 years in cooler climates to complete. The tunnel, or gallery, usually measures 10 to 12 inches long at completion. Pupation takes place at the end of the gallery. After 5 or 6 weeks as a pupa, the adult emerges by chewing through about 3/4 inch of wood, leaving a round exit hole 1/4 to 1/2 inch in diameter. DAMAGE Wood wasp damage in buildings is more cosmetic than structurally weakening. The total number of insects emerging in any one house is limited, usually fewer than a dozen. Emerging wood wasps can chew through just about any substance, and you can see their large exit holes in wallboard or plaster walls, hardwood floors, linoleum, carpeting, nonceramic floor tiles, and other interior surfaces. Wood wasps don’t reinfest structures. Even if male and female wood wasps had the opportunity to mate in the building, the females would not be stimulated to lay eggs in dry, finished lumber. MANAGEMENT Wood wasps are likely to occur anywhere infested timber is used for construction. Even though salvaged timber is adequate for restricted, lower-grade construction purposes such as studs and subflooring, it isn’t valuable enough to warrant kiln drying. Kiln drying or vacuum fumigation of lumber is the only effective way to kill wood wasp larvae that have survived milling operations, but treatment is costly. Fumigation of milled lumber in boxcars, under tarpaulins, and in standing buildings hasn’t been successful. Even though wood wasps can be a noisy, and sometimes scary, nuisance, they aren’t a threat to anyone or anything. Waiting out the life cycle and repairing cosmetic damage is about all that can be done in an infested building.",

    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7418.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Three groups of wood-boring beetles—powderpost, deathwatch, and false powderpost (Table 1)—invade and damage wood furniture as well as structural and decorative wood inside of buildings. The beetle larvae feed in and do most of the damage to wood, and when they reach the adult stage, they emerge through round exit holes, which they create by chewing through the wood surface. Adults of some species also bore exit holes through plaster, plastic, and even soft metals that might cover the underlying wood. You might see other wood-boring beetles such as flatheaded or roundheaded borers and bark or ambrosia beetles in your home if you store infested firewood inside. However, these typically are forest insects that won’t attack wood structures or furniture. They begin their life cycles on declining trees that are old or that have sustained fire or insect damage. Sometimes these forest insects are present in trees when they are milled into wood products, and they might cause alarm when they emerge from infested wood used in newly constructed buildings. However, they aren’t able to reinfest the wood in these structures. Certain species of wood wasps also might emerge from infested wood used in new structures. See Pest Notes: Wood Wasps and Horntails for more information. Invasive wood-boring insects often arrive as hitchhikers from other continents on solid wood packing material such as pallets or in a ship’s dunnage, and some of the key beetle pests of wood in structures have likely established worldwide distributions this way.",
    "life_cycle": "Powderpost Beetles A subfamily of beetles in the family Bostrichidae (formerly referred to as the family Lyctidae) are known as powderpost beetles, because larvae create a fine, dustlike powdered frass (a mixture of feces and wood fragments) that has the consistency of baking flour or talcum powder. This boring dust is packed into the larval galleries (feeding channels) in the wood but occasionally falls out of exit holes into small piles on floors or other surfaces. This fine, powdery frass distinguishes powderpost beetles from other wood-boring beetles in homes. It also differs from the larger, granular, and almost pepperlike pellets drywood termites leave behind; if you look closely at termite pellets, you will see they have ridges on their sides. Powderpost beetles attack hardwoods, apparently because these woods have pores into which they can lay eggs; softwoods don’t have such pores. The large pores in bamboo also make it a favored host material for powderpost beetles. In addition to large pore size, powderpost beetles also prefer wood with high starch content; the starch content in softwoods is nutritionally low for these beetles. They will attack wood that is very dry and that has a moisture content as low as 8%. Adult powderpost beetles most often select and lay eggs in wood such as oak, ash, hickory, mahogany, and walnut, and infestations are most likely to occur in wood paneling, molding, flooring, window and door frames, plywood, bamboo articles, and furniture. Infestations can occur if beetles or larvae are brought into a building in furniture, firewood, or wooden decorative articles. Sometimes the only sign of infestation is the tiny, round exit holes made by the emerging adult beetles. Once they emerge, the winged adults spread to other wood surfaces where they deposit eggs onto unfinished surfaces or in cracks or other openings. They also tend to fly toward light, so you’ll typically find dead adults on windowsills after they have tried to disperse. They have a life cycle ranging from 3 months to more than 1 year, depending on temperature, humidity, and the nutritional quality of the wood. Adult powderpost beetles usually are shades of brown to red. Species frequently encountered in California structures include the old world lyctus beetle, Lyctus brunneus; the southern lyctus beetle, Lyctus planicollis; and the western lyctus beetle, Lyctus cavicollis. Deathwatch Beetles Wood-boring beetles in the family Anobiidae are known as deathwatch beetles. They are closely related to the drugstore and cigarette beetles, which are stored-products pests. Adults communicate with each other and probably locate mates by tapping their heads against wood, usually at night. Deathwatch beetles might have acquired their name during medieval times in Europe when people heard the tapping while sitting up with a sick or dying person during the night. Legend has it they attributed the sound to the tapping of the staff of the scythe of the grim reaper coming to take away the soon-to-be deceased. Deathwatch beetles primarily infest softwoods, especially Douglas-fir, which is used in girders, beams, foundation timbers, and some types of furniture. You’ll typically find this beetle in old wood or wood that is partially decayed. Deathwatch beetles prefer wood that is more moist—greater than 14% moisture content—than what powderpost beetles prefer, so they might be less of a problem in houses with central heating and air conditioning; you are more likely to encounter them in damp sub areas, basements, or outbuildings. Unlike powderpost beetles, deathwatch beetles in California are more likely to invade structures from wild population sources located outdoors. Deathwatch beetle larvae fill their galleries with very small pellets of frass (smaller than the pellets drywood termites produce), which gives their frass a slightly grittier consistency than that of powderpost beetles but not as coarse as that of false powderpost beetles. However, like powderpost beetles, the larvae do most of the damage, and their frass is packed in the galleries and is visible only when larvae or adults push it out through emergence holes. Holes that deathwatch beetles leave can be of various sizes, whereas those from powderpost or false powderpost beetles tend to all be the same size. Adults are reddish to dark brown and lay eggs in crevices, small openings, or pores of unfinished wood. It can take 2 years to complete each generation. The species frequently encountered in California is the Pacific deathwatch beetle, Hemicoelus gibbicollis. False Powderpost Beetles Wood-boring beetles in the family Bostrichidae are sometimes known as false powderpost beetles. False powderpost beetles colonize a variety of hardwoods and sometimes softwoods. Tropical species of Bostrichidae frequently are imported into the United States on bamboo articles or on woods such as Philippine mahogany or lauan. Unlike female powderpost and deathwatch beetles, which lay their eggs while on the wood surface, false powderpost beetle females bore a tunnel, or egg gallery, into wood or other materials then deposit their eggs in pores or cracks within the tunnel. Larvae of false powderpost beetles pack their galleries very tightly with frass that has the consistency of coarse powder similar to powdered borax soap. The texture of this frass is the most gritty of the three groups and distinguishes false powderpost beetles from true powderpost beetles and deathwatch beetles. In buildings, false powderpost beetles infest floors, furniture, hardwood paneling, and other wood materials. Adults of some species bore through soft metal such as lead and silver as well as plaster and other nonwood materials, searching for sites to deposit eggs or protection from weather extremes. This gives rise to the common name “leadcable borer” for one species, Scobicia declivis, because of its habit of boring into the metal covering of suspended telephone or electrical cables. This species also is known for its habit of attacking wine-soaked oak in wine barrels or the corks in alcohol specimen vials in insect collections; hence it also has been called the “cask borer.” In the wild in California, the leadcable borer frequently is associated with dying branches on native oak and walnut trees. In urban and rural outdoor settings, it can be found in association with eucalyptus and other ornamental hardwood trees. Adult false powderpost beetles are dark brown or black, sometimes with reddish mouthparts, legs, and antennae. Adults of most species are about 1/4 inch long, but one very abundant native California species, the black Polycaon, Polycaon stoutii, is 1 1/2 to 2 inches long. Adult false powderpost beetles have a humpback appearance, so you typically won’t see the head if you view the beetle from above. This characteristic also is true of deathwatch beetles. The duration of the false powderpost beetle life cycle varies. Most species develop in 1 year, but the black Polycaon can take up to 20 years to develop. In California, this species frequently is encountered in hardwood flooring from oak, ash, walnut, cherry, or even madrone and is thought to infest the raw flooring material at the mill or holding areas prior to construction.",

    "managementPestNote": "The first step in managing wood-boring beetles is identifying the group involved in the problem. Two quick diagnostic tests, the ballpoint pen test and the frass test (Table 2), can help distinguish among the three groups of wood-boring beetles. Detection can be difficult, because much of their life cycle takes place beneath the wood surface and in hidden wood junctions where a homeowner or inspector might not easily detect them. Wood-boring beetles are difficult to control once an infestation has begun. Therefore, prevention is the best management method. Protective measures should take place at every stage of lumber processing and handling including lumber mills, plywood mills, lumberyards, furniture-manufacturing factories, and building-construction firms. Sanitation is the most important aspect of prevention. Remove and destroy dead tree limbs around buildings or near any area where wood products are stored. Destroy scrap lumber and other wood products before infestation occurs. For some pests such as the black Polycaon false powderpost beetle, curtailment of exterior mercury vapor lighting around lumberyards and warehouses is recommended to reduce the chances of attracting the beetle to the site. Kiln drying lumber destroys beetle infestations, although it doesn’t prevent reinfestation. Heat treatment of the core of imported wood packing material to 133°F for 30 minutes to combat these types of pests is an important phytosanitary regulation adopted by current international convention. Thoroughly inspect materials used for constructing buildings before use to ensure they don’t contain wood-boring beetles. Protect wood from infestation by painting or varnishing to seal pores, cracks, and holes where these beetles could lay eggs. To keep from accidentally introducing wood-boring beetles into a finished structure, inspect furniture and other objects before bringing them into buildings. Remove and fumigate objects that show signs of beetle infestation. When bringing in firewood, limit yourself to only what you will burn that day. Also, inspect buildings for signs of wood-boring beetle damage. Look for exit holes where adult beetles have emerged, and be aware of any new beetles accumulating on your windowsills. Once you have located galleries, tap out the frass to aid in identifying the pest (Table 2). You can heat small wooden items—but not those containing fabrics, pelts, or paints—in an oven at 120° to 140°F for 6 hours. You also can place items in a deep freezer at 0°F for 72 hours. Longer treatments might be necessary if the wood is thicker than 2 inches. Remove and replace infested structural wood whenever possible to eliminate beetles. Destroy infested wood by burning or take it to a landfill. Where removal isn’t possible, liquid insecticides can be applied to bare structural wood. The most effective and safest materials are pesticide formulations containing sodium borate (e.g., Tim-Bor and Bora-Care), which a licensed pest control operator must apply. These materials must penetrate wood to kill beetle larvae that are within, so finished wood can’t be successfully treated. Depth of penetration is enhanced in moist wood; if moisture is less than 15%, penetration might occur only in the top 1/4 inch. For extensive powderpost and deathwatch beetle infestations within a building or where inaccessible structural parts of a building are involved, many professional pest control operators offer whole-building fumigation. Homeowners should bear in mind this method doesn’t prevent reinfestation; a new infestation could be initiated as soon as the fumigant is removed from the structure. Research results have demonstrated that fumigation works best to control adults and larvae; wood-boring beetle eggs require a higher dose of fumigant.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The windscorpion, Eremobates pallipes (order Solifugae), is a predatory arachnid related to spiders (Figure 1). Other names include camel spider and sun spider, but it is neither a spider (order Araneae) nor a scorpion (order Scorpiones). Windscorpions are common in California’s San Joaquin Valley and arid sections of the Southwest. The windscorpion is 3/4 to 1-1/2 inches long and yellowish brown. It has a rounded abdomen and no stinger. Unlike spiders, it doesn’t have venom glands or web-spinning organs, and unlike scorpions, it doesn’t have pincers. Windscorpions have large, pincerlike jaws and a large pair of leglike organs called pedipalps that are located on the head or cephalothorax region (Figure 2). They use their pedipalps to seize and pass prey to their jaws, where they crush it. The windscorpion has four pairs of legs, but it walks only on the last three pairs while using the first pair as feelers. The windscorpion is so named because its long legs enable it to run swiftly or like the wind. Windscorpions feed primarily on living insects, spiders, and other small creatures such as lizards that they catch. They are active mostly at night, but you also might see them moving about during the day. They can appear on roads and paths and sometimes enter buildings. During the day they hide beneath stones and other objects or in burrows. The female lays about 50 eggs in a burrow that she digs into the soil. She then guards the burrow until the young hatch.",

    "managementPestNote": "Windscorpions occasionally cause concern when they enter buildings at night while seeking their prey. Although they look fierce, windscorpions can’t seriously harm people. They can bite if you handle them but do this only in self defense or if you restrain them. Because they don’t have poison glands, their bite isn’t serious. If you find one indoors, catch and release it outside. To catch a windscorpion, place a jar over it, then slip a piece of paper beneath the jar to form a seal over the opening. Carry the jar outside and release the windscorpion. To prevent them from entering your home, seal any cracks or openings around the foundation and beneath doors. No chemical control measures are recommended for windscorpions. Windscorpions are regarded as beneficial, because they feed on insects. Their harmless nature to people also should discourage control.",

    "name": "Widow Spiders and Their Relatives",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn74149.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "There are two species of widow spiders in California, the western black widow and the brown widow. Both are in the genus Latrodectus and are characterized by a similar body shape, reclusive habit, and irregular cobwebs. The western black widow, a native species, is widespread, and is the spider posing the greatest potential envenomation threat to humans in the western United States. It is well known in many localities, and nonprofessionals can identify it easily. In the first decade of the 21st century, the non-native brown widow became established in southern California. Although it isn't nearly as dangerous as the black widow, it causes alarm because of the reputation of its relative. BLACK WIDOW SPIDERS Several species of black widow are common in North America, but in the western United States the only species present is the western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus. Its habitat ranges from British Columbia and Alberta to Mexico and throughout the Rocky Mountains to the western portions of the Great Plains. In California, it is a common desert spider that can survive very hot, dry conditions. However, black widows also can be found in mountainous terrain above 5,000-foot elevation in Southern California, where snow covers the ground every winter. Outside California, western black widows are common in urban Colorado, in central and eastern Washington state, and in southern British Columbia. Because the holes, cracks, crevices, trash, and clutter associated with human structures provide ideal habitat for the western black widow, these spiders are often very common around homes, barns, outbuildings, and rock walls. In such supportive habitats, mature females can be found every few feet and sometimes within inches of each other. Identification A mature female western black widow spider is about 1/2 inch (13 mm) in body length, and has a rounded abdomen and very characteristic coloration. She is shiny jet black all over her body and legs, except for a red pattern on the underside of the abdomen, which looks, in perfect specimens, like an hourglass. Some specimens have a brownish or plum-colored tinge, but usually these are females that are so well fed that the black-pigmented abdomen has been stretched until it looks brown instead of black. The red hourglass varies in appearance; it can be two perfect triangles with points merged to make a perfect hourglass, two triangles separated by a space, a triangle and a small bar, minimal or almost imperceptible red coloration, or, on rare occasions, completely absent. The false black widow, which is discussed below, is chocolate brown and never has red coloration, although many people frequently mistake it for a black widow. As easy as it is to identify an adult female black widow, the immatures, looking nothing like the mother, can be difficult to recognize. When black widow spiderlings emerge from their egg sac, they have tan legs and a tan cephalothorax (the body part to which the legs attach), while the abdomen is mostly white with a few black spots. As the spider grows, the background coloration of the abdomen becomes olive-gray or tan; and there is a longitudinal white stripe on the top of the abdomen and diagonal stripes on the flanks, with a small black dot at the uppermost portion of each diagonal stripe. As the spiderlings continue to grow larger, they molt, like all spiders, in order to shed their restrictive exoskeletons. With successive molts in females, the white stripes become thinner, the olive-gray or tan coloration darkens toward black, and eventually the spider acquires its well-known black coloration. Some mature females retain one or two conspicuous, indented white lines on the front surface of the abdomen that look like a corporal's chevrons. In the youngest spiders, the space where the hourglass develops starts off being a whitish shield. As the spider grows and molts several times, the color of this shield turns from white-yellow to orange-red and changes from a shield with a thick middle portion to an hourglass with a thin, tapered middle. In contrast to the female, the male black widow retains the coloration of the juvenile. After it matures, it stops eating and its abdomen shrinks (its only task at this point is to mate). The male still retains one longitudinal abdominal stripe and a set of diagonal flank stripes on each side of the abdomen. The males are much smaller than the females in body length, although sometimes their legs are almost as long as those of the adult female. Egg Sac The egg sac of the western black widow is yellowish and teardrop-shaped, tapered at the top and bulbous at the bottom. The margins of the sac are well defined (as opposed to some spider egg sacs, which look like fluffy cotton balls, making it difficult to determine exactly where the egg sac starts). The egg sac covering is very tough and difficult to rip apart. A female western black widow typically lays about 300 eggs per sac. Because females can store sperm from their only mating, they can produce more than 10 egg sacs without subsequent matings and without a decrease in the number of eggs or a reduction in the percentage of eggs that will successfully hatch into spiderlings. Habitat The western black widow is found in populated areas almost everywhere in California. Although they can be found in homes, black widows typically nest outside, around the home in holes and crevices, and within clutter. In garages, they usually make webs by doors, near vents, and in other places where insects may pass by. Because most people don't tolerate large numbers of insects in their living spaces, widow spiders usually won't find sufficient prey to survive inside homes. Black widows are shy spiders that seek retreats, such as holes between bricks or spaces around pipe penetrations in walls, where they can hide during the day and then come out at night. In natural settings, you can often find them in rodent burrows and crevices in rock faces. The spider makes a web of tangled silk extending from this retreat hole. The web doesn't have a very recognizable pattern, although it does have vertical support threads above and below the central areas where the spider sits while it waits for prey at night. The lower support threads also alert the widow to the presence of a prey item blundering into the web. In most cases, a widow spider will seek a retreat near the ground as the home base for her web, which connects to the retreat, allowing the spider to emerge to catch both flying and crawling prey at night, usually within three feet of the ground. However, some spiders will make a retreat well above ground level, such as in the eave of a house, and then drop down 10 or more feet before building their web. Widow spiders come out at dusk. After making improvements to their existing web, they take up a position in the middle, their underside facing upward, to wait for prey. Any large disturbance of the web that indicates something larger than a prey item causes the spider to quickly move toward the safety of its retreat. The silk of a mature black widow is very strong. If you run your finger through the web of a large spider, the result is an audible ripping sound. Black widow silk is so strong that during World War II, it was used to make crosshairs for gun sights. Medical Aspects Bites from black widow spiders are quite rare, even where these spiders are very common. In the unlikely event of an actual bite from a black widow, the bite itself is painless or may feel like a little pinprick. Almost all medically important black widow bites are from the adult female, which is much larger than the male. The female also has stronger biting muscles and a larger venom reserve. At the site of the bite, there may be a little red mark or red streaking away from the bite. Within an hour, other symptoms may start to appear. Bite victims might suffer from some but not all of the following symptoms:\tRigid stomach muscles, which some medical professionals have misdiagnosed as appendicitis\tSweating, sometimes of just the bitten body part, such as a bite to the hand that results in only the arm sweating profusely\tPain that can be local, radiating, or regional\tUrine retention\tNumbness, agitation, fever, and patchy paralysis (less common)\tAnother sign of envenomation is that bite victims will sometimes move or rock back and forth incessantly to try to lessen the pain from the venom injection process. Although these are the most severe manifestations of black widow bites, symptoms most often merely resemble those of the flu. Black widow bites don't cause conspicuous swelling, necrosis, or deterioration of tissue around the bite. As a neurotoxin, the venom of a black widow affects the nerve-muscle junction in the body. Normally, the body's neurons work like a light switch: they make the muscle turn on and then off again so that the muscle can relax and be ready to contract again if needed. The venom causes the muscle to repeatedly contract. It would be like flipping on a light switch and not being able to turn it off again. If bitten, seek medical attention immediately. You can place a cold pack on the bite to relieve the pain. An antivenom for black widow bites is available that works for all species that have been tested worldwide. Response is fast, and bite victims can go from intense pain back to normal in 30 minutes. The antivenom is based on horse serum, so physicians need to monitor for anaphylactic shock. American physicians are somewhat reluctant to use antivenom for this reason and might prefer to have the bite victim simply endure the symptoms, which can be similar to those of a bad flu episode and usually dissipate in a few days. BROWN WIDOW SPIDERS The brown widow spider, Latrodectus geometricus, is found worldwide in subtropical habitats. It probably originated from Africa, or possibly from South America. In North America, the brown widow was found only in Florida for many decades, where it remains rather common. However, in the first decade of the 21st century, the spider began appearing elsewhere, from Texas throughout the Gulf Coast states and up the Atlantic coast into South Carolina. While they were expanding in the southeastern United States, brown widows started being discovered in great numbers in Southern California, where they have caused great concern within the general public. Initial news reports exaggerated the impact of the brown widow. However, unlike that of the black widow, the bite of this spider is not much more toxic to humans than that of other common spiders. Identification Mature female brown widows are smaller than mature female western black widows, being about 3/8\" in body length (10 mm). The normal brown widow spider coloration is a mottled collection of tan, brown, and gray. It has a lengthwise stripe halfway up the back side of the abdomen with two isolated dots in front of it and diagonal stripes on the side, somewhat similar to immature western black widow spiders (see Table 1). However, the usual background coloration of the brown widow is more of a tan, as compared to the western black widow, in which background coloration is more olive-gray. Male brown widows are much smaller [body length: 3/16 inch (4 to 5 mm)] than other widow spiders and therefore might be overlooked or misidentified. There is, however, great variation in brown widow coloration. Spiders can vary from almost white to almost black. When brown widows are very dark, though, this coloration is closer to a flat black than a shiny black like that of a mature black widow female. A mature brown widow female looks very similar to an immature western black widow, thus some skill is needed to identify the two accurately. However, the brown widow egg sac, as described in the next paragraph, is distinctive and a much surer way to confirm the species.\tTable 1. Features used to distinguish brown widows from immature western black widows.\nFeature\tBrown widow\tBlack widow (immature)\nBlack spots on lateral abdominal stripes\tlarge, squarish\tsmall, elliptical\nHourglass\tbottom half larger\ttop half larger\nrough margins\tcrisp, straight margins\nWhite markings on front of abdomen\tnot continuous\tcontinuous\nEgg Sac The egg sac of the brown widow spider has protuberances of silk all over its surface, resembling a very large pollen grain. The sac is so characteristic that it can be used to verify the presence of brown widows even if the spiders themselves are not seen. Brown widows produce about 130 eggs per egg sac and are able to make 20 or more egg sacs in a lifetime, sometimes multiple sacs within a short time period. Female brown widows can be collected with several simultaneously-developing egg sacs. Habitat The habitat of the brown widow is similar in many respects to that of the black widow. They generally reside in cluttered areas outside, such as woodpiles, but you will also find them in more exposed areas, such as on chain-link fences where black widows normally would not be found. They are also extremely common in the nooks and crannies on the undersides of inexpensive plastic patio furniture. Brown widow spiders make irregular webs of strong silk, similar to those of western black widows. Both black widows and brown widows are almost never found in homes. In garages, black widows are common but brown widows are not. Outside and around the home, both spiders are very common. The brown widow appears to be displacing the black widow in some of its habitats, especially in urban areas. Southern California residents frequently mention that they used to have a few black widows, but now only can find brown widows (and in greater numbers). In a study published in 2012, brown widows outnumbered black widows in urban areas; such as around homes, in parks (especially under playground equipment), in zoos, etc. The same study, however, reported that brown widows were not found in natural areas in southern California (such as in chaparral and coastal sage scrub habitat) and were rare around agricultural buildings. Brown widows were occasionally found in agricultural crops such as citrus, apple, and avocado trees as well as in corn stalks, bird-of-paradise leaves and other plants, but most of these finds were in vegetation associated with small home gardens rather than large commercial properties. As of 2016, brown widows were well established from Santa Barbara to the San Bernardino area and south to Mexico. Established populations have not yet been found north of the Los Angeles Basin, in the Central Valley, or in the desert areas (which may be inhospitable for them due to the arid climate). Although unsubstantiated reports of brown widows occurring north of the Los Angeles - Santa Barbara region (such as in the San Francisco Bay area) have been made for years, submitted spiders have been immature black widows, Steatoda (false black widow) spiders of several species, or orbweavers. However, it is possible that the brown widow is continuing to expand its range in California. Medical Aspects The bite of the brown widow is much milder than that of the western black widow. In a study in Africa, the most common symptoms in 15 verified bites were that the bite hurt when it happened and that there was burning pain at the bite site. None of these patients developed the typical dynamic symptoms of black widow envenomation. Despite these observations, there is one American record of a verified bite where the patient developed more severe symptoms and required hospitalization. Although its venom is at least as potent as black widow venom (drop for drop, as tested in mice), the brown widow is smaller and likely injects much less venom during a bite. In addition, bites to people are unlikely since brown widows, when disturbed, typically pull their legs close to the body, drop from their web, and play dead. The recent arrival of the brown widow in Southern California is not a cause for alarm. In fact, if the brown widow is indeed displacing the more toxic black widow, there actually might be a reduction in spider bite risk as compared to previous decades. OTHER RELATED SPIDERS False Black Widow The false black widow spider, Steatoda grossa, is not a true widow spider; however, it is in the same family, Theridiidae, as widow spiders and can easily be confused with them. It shares the same rounded-abdomen body form and web-making traits. It is slightly smaller than a mature western black widow spider [body length: 3/8 inch (10 mm)], chocolate brown in color, and never has red coloration on its belly. The false black widow is a European immigrant that has become extremely common in Pacific Coast homes from San Diego to British Columbia, with isolated finds in Alaska. Unlike black widows, false black widow spiders thrive indoors, especially in washrooms, inside cupboards and underneath appliances, furniture and cabinets. False black widows make an egg sac that looks like a cotton ball with indistinct margins. Unlike black widow spiders, false black widow spiderlings are dark like their mothers when they emerge. Because they are common in homes, false black widows are more frequently involved in bite incidents than black widow or brown widow spiders. They have mild venom, and bites may cause symptoms similar to those of yellowjacket wasp stings: initial burning pain followed by minor localized swelling around the envenomation site. When black widow antivenom mistakenly has been used on false black widow bites, it appeared to eliminate the venom's effects. Noble False Widow Spider In 2011, Steatoda nobilis was discovered in Southern California. Like the false black widow, this spider is a European native. Mature females can reach 5/8 inch (14 mm) in body length, which is significantly larger than the false black widow. Instead of being uniformly colored on the top surface of the abdomen as is the false black widow, Steatoda nobilis usually has a light tan pattern somewhat resembling a house with two windows and a domed roof. However, in some specimens, only the remnant tip of the \"roof\" is exhibited. There is also a broad, tan band on the front-facing surface of the abdomen. This spider was first found in Ventura County. It is now widespread in coastal San Diego County, Monterey, and the San Francisco Bay area. Isolated finds have occurred in Los Angeles and Santa Barbara. Bites from this species are not considered to be medically significant. There have been two recorded bites from the spider, with minor symptom development, but because of its large size, it has the potential to hurt merely from fang penetration. This spider will probably continue to spread throughout coastal California.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Minimizing sites around the home where spiders may hide, such as clutter, woodpiles, and heavy ground cover, is essential for reducing widow spider populations. However, it is not practical to eliminate these spiders completely. Both widow species will continue to re-infest treated areas. Regularly vacuuming or sweeping windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, and other seldom-used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually don't survive this process. In the garage, keep items such as gardening clothes and gloves in bags closed with zipper-locks or twist ties. Store seasonal items such as sports gear, camping gear, winter clothes or holiday decorations in boxes that can be taped shut and placed off the floor away from walls in order to exclude spiders. When cleaning up clutter in garages and other storage areas, be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Other areas to check carefully include children's toys or playhouses made of molded plastic that have open spaces facing downward where spiders can crawl in. Additional favored habitats of widow spiders include picnic tables, trash can grips, lawn chairs, plant pots with curled lips, and other outdoor objects with sheltered lips or crevices. Be careful that you do not carry spiders indoors on items such as plants, firewood, and boxes. Stack woodpiles away from your house, and never pick up pieces of wood unless you are wearing gloves. Eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping areas near building foundations free of trash, leaf litter, and accumulations of other materials. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attract spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures pointed off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides do not provide long-term control. Because widow spiders are nocturnal, a nonchemical method of eradication is to search for them at night with a flashlight and kill them with a shoe or rolled up newspaper. If you are concerned about wildlife and feel comfortable doing so, you can remove individual spiders from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper underneath to seal off the opening when you lift the jar. Release the spider about 100 feet from your home into a natural area. Brown widows may not survive in natural areas but on the other hand, they are an invasive, non-native pest species and should not be there anyway. One aspect that makes controlling widow spiders difficult is that they, like many spiders, exhibit a behavior called ballooning. When the spiderlings are very small, on warm days when there is an updraft, they climb to the top of a fence post or piece of vegetation, raise their abdomens into the air, and release a small filament of silk. When the updraft currents overtake the forces of gravity, the spiderling is carried into the air to another location. This may only be a few feet away, or it could be miles. Ballooning spiderlings have been captured at 10,000 feet from the ground and 200 miles offshore. Because spiderlings will be dropping down on your property continually, eliminating them will be a task that needs to be done repeatedly throughout the year. Chemical Control Typically, control of spiders using pesticides is difficult. Various insecticides are registered for control of spiders; including pyrethrins, pyrethroids, and combinations of these products. Curiously, most of these registered pesticides are water-based while the silk of spider egg sacs repels water. In a 2016 study, water-based insecticides sprayed on brown widow egg sacs provided no significant effect on the egg contents. However, when petroleum-based products were used, the pesticide was readily carried past the silk outer layer and killed the egg sac contents.",

They excrete sticky honeydew and cause yellowing or death of leaves. Outbreaks often occur when the natural biological control is disrupted. Management is difficult once populations are high.",
    "damagePestNote": "Whiteflies use their piercing, needlelike mouthparts to suck sap from phloem, the food-conducting tissues in plant stems and leaves. Large populations can cause leaves to turn yellow, appear dry, or fall off plants. Like aphids, whiteflies excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, so leaves may be sticky or covered with black sooty mold that grows on honeydew (See Pest Notes: Sooty Mold). The honeydew attracts ants, which interfere with the activities of natural enemies that may control whiteflies and other pests. Feeding by the immature sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci, can cause plant distortion, discoloration, or silvering of leaves, and may cause serious losses in some vegetable crops. Some whiteflies transmit viruses to certain vegetable crops. Whiteflies are not normally a problem in fruit trees although their populations can build up in citrus, pomegranate and avocado. Several whitefly species occur on ornamental trees and shrubs (see Table 1), but most are uncommon because of natural controls such as parasites and predators. Most whiteflies on trees have limited host ranges. Low levels of whiteflies are not usually damaging. Adults by themselves will not cause significant damage unless they are transmitting a plant pathogen. Generally, plant losses do not occur unless there is a significant population of whitefly nymphs.",
    "managementPestNote": "Management of heavy whitefly infestations is difficult. The best strategy is to prevent problems from developing in your garden or landscape. In many situations, natural enemies will provide adequate control of whiteflies; outbreaks often occur when natural enemies are disrupted by insecticide applications, dusty conditions, or interference by ants. Avoid or remove plants that repeatedly host high populations of whiteflies. In gardens, whitefly populations in the early stages of population development can be held down by a vigilant program of removing infested leaves or hosing down with water sprays. Reflective mulches can repel whiteflies from vegetable gardens, and yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor or, at high levels, reduce whitefly numbers. If you choose to use insecticides, insecticidal soaps or oils such as neem oil may reduce but not eliminate populations. Systemic insecticides may be more effective but can have negative impacts on beneficial insects and pollinators.\tTable 1. Major Economic Hosts of Some Common Whiteflies.\nAsh whitefly\t(Siphoninus phillyreae)\nHost plants: many broadleaved trees and shrubs including ash, citrus, Bradford pear and other flowering fruit trees, pomegranate, redbud, toyon.\nCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have a very thick band of wax down the back and a fringe of tiny tubes, each with a liquid droplet at the end. Adults are white. Ash whitefly is now under good biological control in CA, so it is rarely seen in high numbers.\tGreenhouse whitefly\t(Trialeurodes vaporariorum)\nHost plants: very broad including most vegetables and herbaceous ornamentals. Also may occur on avocado, fuchsia, gardenia, lantana and redbud.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have very long waxy filaments and a marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and a yellow surface or substrate.\nBandedwinged whitefly\t(Trialeurodes abutilonea)\nHost plants: very broad including cotton, cucurbits, other vegetables.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have short, waxy filaments around their edges. Adults have brownish bands across the wings, and their body is gray.\tIris whitefly\t(Aleyrodes spiraeoides)\nHost plants: iris, gladiolus, many vegetables, cotton and other herbaceous plants.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe or waxy filaments but are located near distinctive circles of wax where egg laying took place. Adults have a dot on each wing and are quite waxy.\nCitrus whitefly\t(Dialeurodes citri)\nHost plants: citrus, gardenia, ash, ficus, pomegranate.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no fringe around their edges but have a distinctive Y-shape on their backs. Adults are white.\tMulberry whitefly\t(Tetraleurodes mori)\nHost plants: avocado, citrus, mulberry, other trees.\tCharacteristics: Nymphs have blackish, oval bodies with white, waxy fringe. Adults have reddish to gray wing markings.\nCrown whitefly\t(Aleuroplatus coronata)\nHost plants: oak, chestnut.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs are black with large amounts of white wax arranged in a crownlike pattern. Adults are white.\tSweetpotato whitefly\t(Bemisia tabaci)\nHost plants: very broad including many herbaceous and some woody plants including cole crops, cotton, cucurbits, tomatoes, peppers, crape myrtle, lantana, roses, and hibiscus.\tCharacteristics: Fourth-instar nymphs have no waxy filaments or marginal fringe. Adults have white wings and yellow body; they hold their wings slightly tilted to surface or substrate.\nGiant whitefly\t(Aleurodicus dugesii)\nHost plants: avocado, begonia, hibiscus, giant bird of paradise, orchid tree, banana, mulberry, vegetables, and many ornamentals.\tCharacteristics: Adults are up to 0.19 inch long. They leave spirals of wax on leaves. Nymphs have long filaments of wax that can be up to 2 inches long and give leaves a bearded appearance. For more information, see Pest Notes : Giant Whitefly.\tWoolly whitefly\t(Aleurothrixus floccosus)\nHost plants: citrus, eugenia.\tCharacteristics: Nymphs are covered with fluffy, waxy filaments. Adults are white.\nBiological Control Whiteflies have many natural enemies, and outbreaks frequently occur when these natural enemies have been disturbed or destroyed by pesticides, dust buildup, or other factors. General predators include lacewings, bigeyed bugs, and minute pirate bugs . Several small lady beetles including Clitostethus arcuatus (on ash whitefly) and scale predators, such as Scymnus or Chilocorus species, and the Asian multicolored lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, feed on whiteflies. Whiteflies have a number of naturally occurring parasites that can be very important in controlling some species. Encarsia spp. parasites are commercially available for release in greenhouse situations; however, they are not generally recommended for outdoor use because they are not well adapted for survival in temperate zones. You can evaluate the degree of natural parasitization in your plants by checking empty whitefly pupal cases. Those that were parasitized will have round or oval exit holes and those from which a healthy adult whitefly emerged will have a T-shaped exit hole. Whitefly nymphs can sometimes be checked for parasitization before emergence by noting a darkening in their color. However, some whitefly parasites do not turn hosts black; and some species of whitefly nymphs that occur on ornamentals are black in their healthy, unparasitized state. Avoiding the use of insecticides that kill natural enemies is a very important aspect of whitefly management. Products containing carbaryl, pyrethroids, or imidaclo­prid (especially as a foliar application) can be particularly disruptive. Control of dust and ants, which protect whiteflies from their natural enemies, can also be important, especially in citrus or other trees. Removal Hand removal of leaves or plants heavily infested with the nonmobile nymphal and pupal stages may reduce populations to levels that natural enemies can contain. Remove and destroy whitefly-infested vegetable plants after harvest. Always inspect new plants for whiteflies and nymphs before introducing them in the greenhouse or garden. If you have evergreen perennial plants that consistently host high populations of whiteflies in the winter season, then you may wish to remove these plants to lower overwintering populations. If you have high populations of whiteflies in a greenhouse, removing all host plants from the greenhouse for at least 2 weeks (and assuring that no whiteflies can enter from outside) may eliminate problems. Water sprays (syringing) may also be useful in dislodging adults. Watering can also reduce the hot, dry dusty conditions that favor whiteflies and inhibit their natural enemies. Reflective Mulches Shiny metallic-coated construction paper or reflective plastic mulches can repel whiteflies, especially away from small plants. Alternatively, you can spray clear plastic mulch with silver paint. Reflective plastic mulches are available online and in some garden stores. When putting a reflective mulch in your garden, first remove all weeds. Place the mulch on the plant beds and bury the edges with soil to hold them down. After the mulch is in place, cut 3- to 4-inch diameter holes and plant several seeds or single transplants in each one. You may be able to furrow irrigate or sprinkle your beds if you use coated construction paper or other porous mulch if it is sturdy enough to tolerate sprinkling. Plastic mulches will require drip irrigation. In addition to repelling whiteflies, aphids, and leafhoppers, the mulch will enhance crop growth and control weeds. Reflective mulches have been shown to deter pests that transmit viruses in commercial vegetable crops, perhaps helping to reduce disease incidence and crop loss. When summertime temperatures get high, remove mulches to prevent overheating plants. Traps In vegetable gardens, yellow sticky traps can be posted around the garden to trap adults. Such traps won’t eliminate damaging populations but may reduce them somewhat as a component of an integrated management program relying on multiple tactics. Whiteflies do not fly very far, so many traps may be needed. You may need as many as one trap for every two large plants, with the sticky yellow part of the trap level with the whitefly infestation. Place traps with the sticky side facing plants but out of direct sunlight. Traps are most useful for monitoring and detecting whiteflies rather than controlling them. Commercial traps or sticky cards are available in stores and online. Additionally, you can make traps out of 1/4-inch plywood or masonite board, painted bright yellow, and mounted on pointed wooden stakes. Drive stakes into the soil close to the plants that are to be protected. Although commercially available sticky materials such as Tanglefoot are commonly used as coatings for the traps, you might want to try to make your own adhesive from one-part petroleum jelly or mineral oil and one-part household detergent. This material can be easily cleaned off boards with soap and water, whereas a commercial solvent must be used to remove the other adhesives. Periodic cleaning is essential to remove insects and debris from the boards and maintain the sticky surface. Insecticide Sprays Whiteflies can be difficult to control with insecticides. Most less-toxic products such as insecticidal soaps, neem oil, or petroleum-based oils control only those whiteflies that are directly sprayed. Therefore, plants must be thoroughly covered with the spray solution, and repeat applications may be necessary. Be sure to cover undersides of all infested leaves; usually these are the lowest leaves and the most difficult to reach. Use soaps or oils when plants are not drought-stressed and when temperatures are under 90°F to prevent possible “burn” damage to plants. Early evening, when there is enough light to safely apply products but when the sun is not shining directly on plants, may be a good time to spray. The soil-applied systemic insecticide imidacloprid can control whitefly nymphs. Imidacloprid can have negative impacts on natural enemies, honey bees and other pollinators in the garden, especially when applied as a foliar spray or as a soil application to plants that are flowering or soon to be flowering. It can also cause outbreaks of spider mites. Reserve its use for special situations where these problems can be avoided. Avoid using other pesticides (other than soaps and oils) to control whiteflies; not only do most of them kill natural enemies, whiteflies quickly build up resistance to them, and most are not very effective in garden situations.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Whiteflies are tiny, sap-sucking insects that fly around plants when disturbed. Adults are white and may have darker markings on their wings, while nymphs (immature stage) are oval, legless, and don't move. Nymphs cause most of the damage. Several whitefly species occur in California. Natural enemies often keep them under control. Prevent whitefly problems using reflective mulches, reducing dusty conditions, choosing less susceptible plants, and avoiding pesticides that kill whitefly natural enemies. When management is required, consider using sticky traps, spraying insecticidal soaps or oils, or removing infested plants. Signs of a whitefly infestation can include: Tiny nymphs on the underside of leaves. Sticky honeydew on leaves, fruit, or beneath plants, or a covering of black sooty mold. Yellowing, silvering, or drying leaves that have whitefly nymphs on them. Deposits of white wax with certain whiteflies. Reduce whiteflies using traps or hand removal. Inspect new plants for whiteflies before bringing them into your garden. Prune out isolated infested leaves when you first detect them. Hose adults off plants with a strong stream of water. Hang store bought, sticky-coated yellow traps or make your own. Use one trap for every medium-size vegetable plant. Promptly destroy infested annuals when the flowering or fruiting ends. Use reflective mulch to protect young plants. Use shiny metallic-coated construction paper or reflective plastic mulch products. These mulches repel whiteflies while plants are small. Lay the product on bare soil, bury its edges with soil, and insert seedlings or seeds into holes in the mulch. Plastic mulches require drip irrigation underneath them; paper mulches may be sprinkle or furrow irrigated. Remove mulches when plants get large and temperatures get hot. Protect other insects that help reduce whitefly numbers. Many beneficials or “natural enemies” such as lacewings and lady beetles help control whiteflies. Look for signs of parasitization by mini-wasps, such as circular holes in nymphs or a change in color. Prevent dusty conditions since dust disrupts beneficials. Keep ants, which protect whiteflies from natural enemies, out of plants. Avoid using pesticides such as pyrethroids, organophosphates, carbaryl, or neonicotinoids. What about pesticides? Choose products that are least harmful to natural enemies—such as insecticidal soaps and oils—and combine their use with the other practices listed above. Good coverage, including the underside of leaves, is essential. Repeat applications might be required. Avoid using pesticides if natural enemies are present. Even the most toxic insecticides are only partially effective against whiteflies. ",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The walnut husk fly, Rhagoletis completa, infests walnuts in most California walnut-growing areas. It feeds on black walnut and on all varieties of English walnut, but some early maturing varieties can escape infestations in most years. The walnut husk fly is about the size of a housefly and very colorful. It has a yellow spot just below the areas where the wings are attached and iridescent, greenish eyes. The wings have three prominent dark bands, one of which extends around the wing to form a V-shape (Figure 1). The banded wings distinguish it from other flies found in the walnut orchard. Larvae feed in groups within the husk, but you won’t see them unless you remove the skin of the damaged husk (Figure 2). Dark, soft blotches on maturing husks are a good clue to husk fly presence (Figure 3). Blotches that are hard and dry are caused by blight disease and should not be confused with husk fly damage.",
    "life_cycle": "This fly has one generation per year. Walnut husk flies overwinter as pupae in the soil and emerge as adults in some areas as early as May but generally around July 1. Peak emergence often occurs mid-July through mid-August. The female fly deposits eggs in groups of about 15 below the surface of the husk (Figure 5). Usually the first sign of an infestation is a small, stinglike mark on the husk caused by this depositing of eggs (Figure 6). At first these areas are difficult to see, but they soon darken and appear as little, black spots on the husk, usually near the stem end of the husk and often on the shaded side of the nut. Eggs hatch into white maggots within 5 days. The maggots feed inside the husk, enlarging the black area, which remains soft, unsunken, and smooth. The outer skin of the husk usually remains intact, but its fleshy parts decay and stain the nutshell. Older maggots are about 1/4 inch long and are yellow with black mouthparts. After feeding on the husk for 3 to 5 weeks, mature maggots drop to the ground and burrow several inches into the soil to pupate. Most emerge as adults the following summer, but some remain in the soil for 2 or more years.",
    "damagePestNote": "The primary damage from the husk fly is nutshell staining, which is a problem in commercial orchards where nuts are grown for in-shell sale; however, this can be tolerated in backyard situations. Feeding by the husk fly maggots also causes the damaged husks to stick to the shell, making them difficult to remove. An early season husk fly infestation (June to mid-August) can result in shriveled, moldy kernels.",
    "managementPestNote": "Most home orchardists ignore the walnut husk fly, because generally it doesn’t affect the nutmeats. Since the husks can be difficult to remove, home orchardists can place the damaged nuts in a damp burlap bag for a few days before attempting to remove the hull. Be sure to dispose of infested husks in a tightly sealed bag. Certain general sanitation practices that reduce the number of husk flies overwintering near a tree or orchard can assist with control. These practices include removing and disposing of damaged nuts as soon as possible. It also might be possible to reduce next year’s population by spreading a tarp under the tree from July through August to prevent the maggots from entering the soil to pupate. If gardeners feel treatment is necessary in home orchard situations for trees with early or severe infestations, they can make multiple applications of insecticide combined with bait beginning in July. These sprays are aimed at controlling adults before they can lay eggs. Spray on a 7- to 14-day interval until within 1 month of harvest. Eggs laid later than this will not have time to develop and cause damage. Add bait to the spray as an attractant so that the flies will feed on the spray. When using bait, complete coverage of the tree often is not required, which makes application easier for home gardeners with large trees. Commercial growers use specially prepared baits that they mix with insecticide or pre-mixed insecticide baits for walnut husk fly such as GF-120 Naturalyte Fruit Fly Bait. These products are sold only in large quantities but sometimes are available at farm chemical suppliers for home use. Their effectiveness for home use situations is unknown. Molasses might work as a bait in backyard situations when mixed with insecticide. Add about 4 to 6 tablespoons of molasses per gallon of water applied. Currently the only home-use insecticide available for walnut husk fly is spinosad (e.g., Monterey Garden Insect Spray). It might be only partially effective. According to state regulations, a home gardener can personally use a nonregistered substance such as molasses for the purpose of controlling home or garden pests on residential property that they own, lease, or rent provided no food or feed commodities treated with the substance are sold, distributed, or fed to animals sold or distributed for human consumption.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Lyme disease is a potentially serious disease, and can be localized or affect multiple body systems. In the United States, the disease is caused almost exclusively by the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi, a corkscrew-shaped bacterium. Five additional species of Lyme disease-group spirochetes have been described from California, but only one of them, Borrelia bissettii, has been found to occasionally infect people. Lyme disease spirochetes are transmitted to humans and other animals by the feeding activities of certain ticks. Of the 48 tick species established in California, 6 species attach to humans with some regularity, but only nymphs (an immature tick life-stage) and adult females of the western blacklegged tick, Ixodes pacificus, transmit Borrelia burgdorferi to people. A closely related tick species, the blacklegged or deer tick (Ixodes scapularis), transmits B. burgdorferi in eastern North America, but that tick does not occur in California. Ixodes pacificus has been reported in 56 out of 58 counties in the state. This tick has a broad host range and, as of 2007, has been recorded feeding on 108 species of lizards, birds, and mammals within the state. Moreover, it attaches to humans more frequently than any other tick species. In northern California areas where Lyme disease occurs, usually about 1–2% of the adult Ixodes pacificus ticks and 2–15% of the nymphal ticks, on average, are infected with Borrelia burgdorferi. The risk of encountering infected nymphs varies spatially within a property and from year to year. Circumstantial evidence suggests that most persons infected with Borrelia burgdorferi acquire their infections following exposure to nymphs rather than adult ticks. First recognized in the United States as an emerging disease in the mid-1970s in Lyme, Connecticut, Lyme disease has been reported in Canada and in many European and Asian countries. The first Lyme disease case in California was reported from Sonoma County in 1978. Lyme disease was designated a reportable disease in California and the United States in 1989 and 1991, respectively. Since 1989, more than 2,600 cases have been documented in California through 2014. The number of confirmed cases reported to state health authorities ranged from 57 to 97 per year between 2005 and 2014. Typical of all disease surveillance systems, the number of Lyme disease cases may be under-reported or misclassified (i.e., disease due to another cause). Assuming these conditions apply across the United States, it is clear that the incidence of Lyme disease in California is much less than it is in highly endemic areas of the northeastern and upper midwestern United States. Overall, the incidence of Lyme disease in California is usually only 0.2 cases per 100,000 persons per year. Nonetheless, certain California counties pose a much higher risk of contracting Lyme disease than others. For example, the highest average incidence from 2005 to 2014 occurred in the northwestern counties of Trinity (4.5), Humboldt (3.9), and Mendocino (3.9), as well as in the northern Sierra-Nevada counties of Sierra (3.2) and Nevada (2.7). These county estimates vary slightly due to year-to-year variation in reporting, but the patterns of risk remain similar.",

These county estimates vary slightly due to year-to-year variation in reporting, but the patterns of risk remain similar.",
    "damagePestNote": "Lyme Disease Signs and Symptoms Lyme disease begins in up to 60 to 80% of patients as a slowly expanding reddish rash known as “erythema migrans”, typically 3 to 32 days after the bite of an infectious tick. This rash, which may not be apparent on dark-skinned people, usually begins at the location where the tick attached and expands slowly to several inches in diameter before disappearing within 3 to 4 weeks. Antibiotic treatment reduces the duration of the rash to about a week. Many patients experience fatigue, headache, fever, chills, and other flulike symptoms during the initial stage of illness. Without treatment, other signs or symptoms may occur days to months later. These can involve the skin (multiple secondary rashes), musculoskeletal system (migratory pain in joints, tendons, muscles, or bones), neurologic system (severe headache, facial palsy, memory loss), and enlarged lymph nodes. More rarely, inflammation of the heart or eyes, or liver damage, may ensue, too. People with untreated late-stage Lyme disease may begin to experience signs or symptoms months or years after infection, which may result in arthritic, neurologic, or further skin manifestations. Deaths attributable to Lyme disease are rare events: sudden cardiac deaths linked to Lyme carditis (inflammation of the heart) were reported during a 9-month period in 2013 for three young adults who resided in the northeastern United States. Lyme Disease in Pets Dogs are susceptible to Lyme disease and may develop arthritis or lameness, lethargy, loss of appetite, enlarged lymph nodes, or other clinical conditions. Consult a veterinarian if you suspect your dog has Lyme disease. Cats, horses, and livestock also may become infected but rarely develop clinical signs.",
    "managementPestNote": "Preventing exposure to ticks is the best way to reduce the risk of getting Lyme disease. Know how to recognize the western blacklegged tick and the areas and times of year where and when this tick occurs. Always inspect clothing, exposed skin, and pets for ticks when outdoors in tick habitats, and oneself for several days afterward to ensure that one or more nymphs may not have been overlooked. Prevention If you spend time outdoors in tick-infested areas, you can significantly reduce the risk of exposure to Ixodes pacificus and other human-biting ticks by taking a few simple precautions. Dress Appropriately Ticks tend to climb upward, so wearing full-length pants and a long-sleeved shirt, tucking your shirt into your pants, and tucking pant legs into socks will help keep ticks off your skin. Consider Acaricides or Repellents As an added precaution, commercially available acaricides or repellents can be sprayed on skin or clothing. Products containing permethrin as the active ingredient are highly effective for personal protection against both immature and adult ticks when applied to clothing. Permethrin is highly toxic to ticks at very low dosages. It should not be applied directly to the skin because it can cause irritation, though it is of low toxicity to humans. Other products containing 20%–30% DEET as the active ingredient are effective against a wide range of bloodsucking ticks and insects and may be applied to either clothing or skin. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions carefully. Water or perspiration can wash repellents off your skin, so they may need to be reapplied after swimming, bathing, or perspiring heavily. Perform Tick Checks While outdoors in tick habitats, frequently inspect your clothing or exposed skin to detect and remove ticks before they have a chance to attach. Ticks may attach anywhere on the body, but on fully clothed persons they often attach to the scalp, behind an ear, or to an arm or leg. Pay particular attention to these areas as well to pant and bare legs when examining yourself or others. Further, examine your bedding for the next several days for the presence of detached, fed ticks. Nymphs of Ixodes pacificus, once attached to human skin, are easily overlooked because of their small size and sometimes hidden feeding sites such as the scalp. Fully satiated nymphs detach from people during the night within as few as 3 days after tick exposure, and they are much easier to detect in a bloated state while digesting their blood meal among bedclothes, including one’s pillow. Shower and Heat Clothing Research has demonstrated that showering within two hours of exposure to ticks offers protection against Lyme disease. Moreover, subjecting clothes worn outdoors to a one-hour dryer cycle at high heat will kill any ticks that crawled onto them. Check Your Pets After they have been outside, dogs and cats can transport ticks indoors. Most ticks will not survive indoors for very long, but unfed ticks that have recently wandered off pets onto bedding, floors, or furniture may attach to people who remain unaware of their presence. Ask your veterinarian about the latest products registered for controlling ticks that infest dogs or cats. Lyme disease vaccines are available for protecting dogs in California. Reduce Tick Abundance In California, about half of the reported cases are contracted around the home in semirural environments. Good landscape management can reduce tick densities in such areas. Some of the same management practices used to make the landscape less hospitable for ticks in the northeastern United States, for example, clearing leaf litter or creating woodchip barriers between lawns and adjacent woodlands, may prove useful in California’s semirural residential settings, or in private or public gardens adjoining natural areas inhabited by wildlife. For an excellent, comprehensive overview of tick management strategies, organic land-care practices, personal protective measures, and chemical control methods, refer to the state of Connecticut’s Tick Management Handbook. Although the ecology of Lyme disease in Connecticut and California differs markedly, this handbook nonetheless is a good read for pertinent information on the subject. For information about managing rodents, deer, lizards, and other potential tick hosts, see UC IPM’s list of vertebrate Pest Notes . Tick Removal If you find an attached tick, remove it immediately. Prompt removal of infected ticks can prevent Lyme disease and other tick-borne illnesses. Research demonstrated that I. pacificus nymphs require more than one day of attachment to begin transmitting B. burgdorferi to rodents. However, the minimum time it takes experimentally infected adult ticks to transmit spirochetes to an animal model has not been evaluated. Since I. pacificus males seldom attach to people and consume small quantities of blood, we speculate that they rarely, if ever, infect humans with B. burgdorferi . In contrast, certain tick-borne agents like those causing Colorado tick fever and Rocky Mountain spotted fever may be transmitted within the first day. Grasp the tick as close to the skin as possible with a pair of tweezers. If tweezers are unavailable, use fingers protected with gloves or tissue paper whenever possible. Be careful not to squash a fed or partially fed tick because some tick-borne agents may be transmitted through broken or possibly even unbroken skin. Slowly and steadily pull the tick straight out. Remove any mouthparts that break off in the wound, and consult a physician if necessary. The mouthparts may be contaminated with other bacteria that sometimes cause secondary infections, but the mouthparts alone will not transmit Lyme disease spirochetes. Do not jerk or twist the tick as you extract it. Do not apply alcohol, fingernail polish, heat from a lit match, or petroleum jelly to the tick. These methods are ineffective and therefore ill-advised. Clean the wound with soap and water. Apply a mild antiseptic such as rubbing alcohol or povidone-iodine, if available. Tick Identification and Testing It may be helpful to save a removed tick for identification. Specialists at governmental agencies (e.g., state and local health departments, mosquito and vector control districts) or universities may be available to assist you with tick identification. Nevertheless, testing a tick that has bitten you is not recommended for medical decision-making because:\tTesting may take considerable time to complete.\tThere is a potential for false positive and false negative test results.\tThe tested tick may not reflect what an undiscovered, concurrently or previously attached tick might have been carrying.\tA tick sometimes may carry more than one disease agent.\tTicks can be submitted to certain commercial laboratories or governmental agencies for testing for presence of Borrelia burgdorferi or other disease agents. Check with your local testing agency or laboratory about whether the ticks should be submitted alive or preserved in isopropyl alcohol. Treatment Consult a physician promptly if you or a family member experiences a flu-like illness or a rash after having been in areas where ticks may be found. Most people who contract Lyme disease or other tick-borne diseases become ill within 1 to 2 weeks after having been bitten. Commonly used antibiotics usually cure Lyme disease. If treatment is delayed, the disease may progress to arthritic, neurologic, or cardiac problems weeks to months later. A vaccine to protect against Lyme disease was approved for human use in December 1998, but decreasing sales, high cost, litigation, and other factors resulted in its withdrawal from the commercial market by early 2002. Research aimed at developing another human Lyme disease vaccine has continued to the present, but a second-generation commercial vaccine has not reached the marketplace yet. Other Tick-Transmitted Disease Agents Besides the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, the western blacklegged tick can transmit bacteria that cause human granulocytic anaplasmosis, which rarely may be fatal, and hard tick-borne relapsing fever (Borrelia miyamotoi disease). Other species of hard or soft ticks in California can transmit at least six additional microbial disease agents, such as those causing human babesiosis, Colorado tick fever, relapsing fever, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tularemia, and Pacific Coast tick fever caused by the recently described bacterium, Rickettsia philipii . Insofar as is known, the latter microbe is transmitted solely by the Pacific Coast tick (Dermacentor occidentalis). It usually causes a painful scab at the site of the tick bite that cannot be confused with erythema migrans. We make this distinction here because I. pacificus bite reactions rarely may present as a scab-like lesion. Consult the Web sites of the California Department of Public Health and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for additional information about ticks, Lyme disease, and other tick-borne diseases.",

",
    "damagePestNote": "Thrips feeding on plants can damage fruit, leaves, and shoots and very noticeably affect plants’ cosmetic appearance. However, thrips rarely kill or threaten the survival of trees and shrubs. Herbaceous ornamentals, and certain vegetable crops, are more susceptible to serious injury from thrips feeding and thrips-vectored viruses, especially when plants are young. Thrips feeding can stunt plant growth and cause damaged leaves to become papery and distorted, develop tiny pale spots (stippling), and drop prematurely. Infested terminals may discolor and become rolled. Petals may exhibit “ color break,” which is pale or dark discoloring of petal tissue that was killed by thrips feeding before buds opened. On some plants thrips can cause severe stunting to the early season flush of terminal growth. Cuban laurel thrips create tightly rolled, podlike leaf terminals on Ficus and form galled foliage from midsummer through fall. Myoporum thrips can create tightly bunched and twisted terminal growth that resembles a gall, within which large numbers of thrips can survive and reproduce. Western flower thrips is primarily a pest of herbaceous plants; but high populations can damage flowers on woody plants, such as roses. Rose petals may develop dark streaks and spots from feeding injury that occurred before the buds opened, or the flower buds may deform and fail to open. Western flower thrips also vectors Impatiens necrotic spot virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus, which can severely damage or kill certain vegetable crops and herbaceous ornamentals. Thrips cause brown to silvery, scabby scarring on the avocado and citrus fruit surface but do not harm the internal quality or flavor of the fruit. Where thrips lay eggs on grapes, fruit may develop dark scars surrounded by lighter “halos.” Thrips feeding on apples, nectarines, and raspberries can deform or scar developing fruit. Citrus thrips feeding severely distorts blueberry shoot tips and foliage, reducing fruit yield. In many thrips species, by the time their damage is observed, such as after buds open, the thrips may no longer be present. Some abiotic disorders, pathogens, and certain other invertebrates can cause damage resembling that of thrips. For example, various true bugs and mites also stipple foliage; and some true bugs produce dark fecal specks. Before taking control action, look carefully for the insects themselves to be certain that pest thrips are present and the cause of the damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "Thrips are difficult to control. If management is necessary, use an integrated program that combines the use of good cultural practices, natural enemies, and the most selective or least-toxic insecticides that are effective in that situation. Monitoring If thrips are a suspected cause of plant damage, thrips adults and larvae can be monitored by branch beating or gently shaking foliage or flowers onto a light-colored sheet of paper, beating tray, or small cloth. For thrips that feed in buds or unexpanded shoot tips, clip off several plant parts suspected of harboring thrips, place them in a jar with 70% alcohol (ethanol), and shake vigorously to dislodge the thrips. Strain the solution through filter paper so thrips can more readily be seen. Watch the online video demonstration of this technique. Adult thrips can also be monitored by hanging bright yellow sticky traps in or near host plants. Be aware that the presence of thrips does not mean that damage will result from their feeding. Large numbers of thrips in traps, or adults in flowers feeding on pollen, do not necessarily indicate that control action is needed. Plants suspected of being infected by thrips-vectored viruses can be reliably diagnosed only by sending properly collected samples from symptomatic plants to a laboratory that tests for plant pathogens. Biological Control Predatory thrips (Table 2), green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, mites, and certain parasitic wasps help to control plant-feeding thrips. To conserve and encourage naturally occurring populations of these beneficials, avoid creating dust and consider periodically rinsing dust off of small plants, avoid persistent pesticides, and grow a diversity of plant species. Where thrips are a problem, learn whether that pest has specific natural enemies important in its control. For example, a minute pirate bug, Macrotracheliella nigra, and green lacewing larvae are important predators of Cuban laurel thrips. Euseius species mites are important predators of citrus thrips. With greenhouse thrips in Southern California up to 50% of its eggs are killed by a tiny wasp, Megaphragma mymaripenne. After feeding inside during its larval stage then pupating, the emerging adult parasite leaves a relatively large round hole in the tiny thrips egg. Conversely, when a greenhouse thrips emerges from an unparasitized egg, part of the egg shell is often visible at the side of the egg blister. Thripobius semiluteus parasitizes greenhouse thrips larvae. Thrips parasitized by this wasp’s larvae become swollen around the head and turn black, in contrast to the pale color of unparasitized greenhouse thrips larvae. Unlike healthy black mature thrips, the black parasitized larvae are smaller and do not move. There is little research-based information on the effectiveness of releasing thrips natural enemies in gardens and landscapes. Releasing purchased natural enemies, in most situations, is unlikely to provide satisfactory thrips control. Cultural Control Thrips species that feed on many different plant species often move into gardens and landscapes when plants in weedy areas or grasslands begin to dry in spring or summer. Avoid planting susceptible plants next to these areas, and control nearby weeds that are alternate hosts of pest thrips. Grow plants that are well-adapted to conditions at that site. For example, plants adapted to grow in full sun can be stressed when planted in shady conditions and may be more susceptible to thrips damage. Provide appropriate cultural care to keep plants vigorous and increase their tolerance to thrips damage. Keep plants well irrigated, and avoid excessive applications of nitrogen fertilizer, which may promote higher populations of thrips. Old, spent flowers can harbor thrips, so their removal and disposal is sometimes recommended. However, the general benefit of this practice in landscapes is unknown; and old blossoms also commonly shelter beneficial predators of thrips. Investigate the availability of resistant cultivars. For example, western flower thrips more often damages fragrant, light-colored, or white roses. Rose cultivars, with sepals that remain tightly wrapped around the bud until just before blooms open, have fewer thrips problems. Where Cuban laurel thrips is a problem on Indian laurel fig you can plant Ficus microcarpa, “Green Gem,” which is mostly resistant to this pest. Pruning Prune and destroy injured and infested terminals when managing a few small specimen plants in the landscape. Avoid shearing plants, which is the clipping of dense foliage to maintain an even surface on formal hedges or creating specific shapes (topiary). Shearing stimulates thrips-susceptible new growth. Prune by cutting plants just above branch crotches and nodes instead of shearing off terminals. Prune during specific times of the year to help control certain thrips. Prune off galled, rolled terminals of Indian laurel fig during winter to greatly reduce thrips damage the next summer. Relatively few Cuban laurel thrips can survive the winter outside of the protection provided by the leaves they gall. Instead of pruning avocado during February through April, January pruning may reduce thrips scarring of fruit. January pruning can induce additional avocado growth flush during May fruit set and reduce thrips scarring of fruit. When succulent foliage is abundant in spring thrips tend to remain and feed on leaves and not move to fruit. Pruning the interior of citrus trees can increase predaceous mite populations in the exterior canopy, thereby reducing fruit scarring by citrus thrips. Row Covers Row covers, hot caps, and other types of cages with a fine mesh can exclude thrips and other insects from vegetables and other young herbaceous plants. Apply row covers before crops emerge or to pest-free plants during planting. Plants are normally covered or caged only while they are young and most susceptible to damage. Once plants become larger or temperatures get warmer, remove covers to provide enough growing space and to prevent overheating. Drip or furrow irrigation is generally necessary when using row covers. Any type of covering that excludes insects but allows light and air penetration can be used. With sturdy crops that do not grow too tall, floating row covers (vented polyethylene, spunbonded polyester, point-bonded polypropylene) can be placed on top of beds with no frames or hoops. The crop itself lifts the fabric as it grows. For plants that grow upright or have sensitive tips that might be damaged when pushing against covers, use hoops, plastic tunnels, or wire strung between posts to hold up covers. Wood, wire, or plastic frames covered with muslin, nylon, or other fine mesh can be used for several years. Reflective Mulch Mulch or mesh that reflects light interferes with certain flying insects’ ability to locate plants. If the plants are initially pest-free, and relatively small in comparison with the surface area that is covered with reflective material, reflective mulch can delay or reduce the extent to which young plants become infested by winged aphids and adult leafhoppers, thrips, and whiteflies. In flower and vegetable crops that are especially sensitive to insect-vectored viruses, the cost and effort of using reflective mulch may be justified; because the mulch can be significantly more effective than insecticides in preventing or delaying infection of small plants. As plants grow larger, reflective mulch becomes increasingly less effective and other management methods may be needed. Reflective mulch ceases to repel insects by the time the plant canopy covers more than about half of the soil surface. Silver or gray is the most effective color for synthetic reflective mulch or mesh, but white also works. Some organic mulches (e.g., straw) and living mulches (e.g., interplanting the crop with buckwheat, Fagopyrum esculentum) may also repel certain pests, but this is not as well documented. Commercially available synthetics include aluminum-metalized polyethylene and silver-embossed polyethylene plastic films. If handled carefully, these may be used for more than one season. Aluminum foil is also effective and may be suitable for a small garden; but it is expensive and difficult to reuse because it is delicate to handle. Synthetic mulch application methods include:\tTransplant seedlings through holes in the mulch.\tApply the mulch before plants emerge from the soil and leave a narrow, mulch-free strip along the planting row.\tLay lightweight material that allows light and air penetration over the top of a crop that is sturdy enough to lift the material as it grows.\tIn addition to temporarily repelling certain flying insects, mulch may improve growth of certain crops by increasing light levels, keeping soil warmer overnight, reducing weed growth, and conserving soil moisture. Mulch can also have negative effects. It can increase crop susceptibility to root diseases, prevent the use of overhead watering, and make it more difficult to know whether you are maintaining proper soil moisture in the rooting zone of a plant. Most recyclers will not accept plastics with soil on them; therefore, plastic mulches typically are disposed of in landfills. Investigate which material and methods are likely to work best in your situation. Chemical Control Although thrips damage is unsightly, it does not usually warrant the use of insecticides in gardens and landscapes. Feeding injury typically does not become apparent until after tissue grows and expands. Thus, by the time damage is noticed on ripening fruit or distorted terminals, the thrips that caused the damage are often gone. No pesticide application will restore the appearance of injured tissue; plants will remain damaged until leaves drop, injury is pruned off, or new unblemished fruit is produced. Where plant viruses are a problem, insecticides typically do not kill thrips fast enough to prevent the transfer of virus from thrips to plants. Using row covers or other methods to prevent thrips infestation is the most effective way to prevent infection by thrips-vectored viruses. Thrips can be difficult to control effectively with insecticides, partly because of their mobility, feeding behavior, and protected egg and pupal stages. Improper timing of application, failure to treat the proper plant parts, and inadequate spray coverage when using contact materials are common mistakes that can prevent potentially effective insecticides from actually providing control. Before using a pesticide, learn more about the biology of your pest species and the characteristics of available products by reading the label and consulting the Active Ingredients Database in the online version of this Pest Note at www.ipm.ucanr.edu. Often you will learn chemical control cannot be effective until the next season, when new plant growth develops. Certain products are available only by hiring a professional applicator. If insecticides are used, combining their use with appropriate cultural practices and other methods usually improves the pest control. Insecticides Most Compatible with IPM Contact insecticides that do not leave persistent residues can be effective for greenhouse thrips and other species that feed openly on plants. These products have low toxicity to people, pets, and pollinators and relatively little adverse impact on biological pest control; because they do not leave toxic residues that would kill natural enemies migrating in after their application. Contact insecticides include azadirachtin (AzaMax, Safer Brand BioNeem), insecticidal soaps (Safer), narrow-range oil (Bonide Horticultural Oil, Monterey Horticultural Oil), neem oil (Green Light Neem, Schultz Garden Safe Brand Neem Oil), and pyrethrins, which many products combine with piperonyl butoxide (Ace Flower & Vegetable Insect Spray, Garden Tech Worry Free Brand Concentrate). To be effective, contact sprays must be applied to thoroughly cover buds, shoot tips, and other susceptible plant parts where thrips are present. On plants with a history of unacceptable damage, begin treatment early when thrips or their damage is first observed. Unless directed otherwise by the product label, periodically repeat the application as long as pest thrips and susceptible plant parts are both present. Spinosad (Captain Jack’s Deadbug Brew, Green Light Lawn & Garden Spray with Spinosad 2, Monterey Garden Insect Spray) is generally more effective against thrips than the products above. Spinosad lasts 1 week or more and moves short distances into sprayed tissue (has translaminar activity) to reach thrips feeding in protected plant parts. Adding horticultural oil to the spray mix can increase its persistence within plant tissue. This insecticide is a fermentation product of a naturally occurring bacterium, and certain formulations are organically acceptable. Spinosad can be toxic to certain natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, syrphid fly larvae) and bees when sprayed and for about 1 day afterward; do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Insecticides More Toxic to Thrips and Beneficial Insects Systemic insecticides are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., roots) and moved (translocated) to other plant parts. Trunk spray or injection of an effective, systemic, neonicotinoid insecticide can provide relatively rapid control. With soil drench or injection, there is a longer time delay between neonicotinoid application and insecticide action. Neonicotinoids vary in effectiveness for thrips control. For example, dinotefuran (Safari), available to professional applicators, can provide good control of thrips. Imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Merit) commonly fails to provide satisfactory thrips control, and imidacloprid generally is not recommended for thrips. Neonicotinoids have low, moderate, or severe adverse impact on natural enemies and pollinators varying with the product, situation, and the species and life stage of invertebrate. Neonicotinoid insecticides can translocate to flowers and may harm natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. Delay systemic insecticide application until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering, unless the product label directs otherwise. Where the roots of nearby plants grow near treated plants, those other plants may also take up some of the soil-applied insecticide. Delay soil application, when possible, until after the nearby plants are also done flowering. To avoid tree injury and potential spread of pathogens on contaminated tools, use a soil application or trunk spray whenever possible, instead of injecting or implanting trees with insecticide. Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. If injecting or implanting multiple trees, prevent the potential spread of pathogens on contaminated tools; before moving to work on each new tree, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate trees and disinfect them with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach). Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Insecticides to Avoid The systemic organophosphate acephate (Lilly Miller Ready-to-Use Systemic, Orthene) is available for ornamental, nonfood plants. Avoid using it. Acephate can be highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause spider mites to become abundant and damage plants after its application. Avoid foliar sprays of other organophosphate insecticides (e.g., malathion), carbamates (carbaryl), or pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin). These materials are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators, can cause spider mite outbreaks, and are not particularly effective against most thrips. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms. Greenhouse Thrips Management Greenhouse thrips can infest many plant species but primarily is a pest of evergreen, broadleaved perennials. It occurs mainly on the underside of leaves and on fruit clusters or other plant parts that touch each other. Greenhouse thrips is sluggish and the adults tend not to fly. Individuals feed in groups and populations usually begin in a limited part of the plant and spread slowly. If the underside of leaves on susceptible plants are regularly inspected to allow early detection and removal of new infestations, pruning off colonies can be effective. Greenhouse thrips is readily controlled with thorough application of contact sprays such as horticultural oil, natural pyrethrins (plus piperonyl butoxide), or insecticidal soaps to the underside of infested leaves. Repeat applications may be necessary. Keep in mind that greenhouse thrips have natural enemies in the landscape (discussed above). Assess whether spraying is warranted and select materials that are least toxic to natural enemies.\tTable 1.

    "contentQuickTips": "When thrips feed, they distort or scar leaves, flowers, or fruit. Healthy woody plants usually tolerate thrips, although damage can become unattractive. Herbaceous ornamentals and developing fruits and vegetables can suffer more serious injuries. Manage thrips by combining good cultural care, pest exclusion, thrips-resistant plants, and less toxic insecticides that are softer on natural enemies. Thrips are tiny, slender insects with hairs on their wing margins. They are less than 1⁄20 inch long and their color varies depending on the species and life stage. Thrips hatch from eggs and develop through two feeding larval (nymphal) stages and two nonfeeding stages (prepupa and pupa) before developing into adults. Most pest thrips feed while hidden, often in buds and shoot tips or beneath sepals; you’ll often observe the damage before seeing the thrips. Greenhouse thrips and western flower thrips are two common pest species in landscapes. Certain thrips are beneficial predators of some insects and mites. Damage often isn‘t apparent until tissue grows and expands. Look for: Scabby, silvery to dark brown discoloration on fruit, leaves, or petals Dark specks of excrement on fruit or leaves Distorted, curled, galled, or dead shoot tips and leaves Check for thrips before taking action. Be certain that pest thrips are present and causing damage before taking control action. Harsh weather, inadequate plant care, pathogens, and other invertebrates can cause similar-looking damage. Shake foliage or flowers over white paper to see if this dislodges any thrips. Hang blue or bright yellow sticky traps to detect flying thrips. Thrips are difficult to control. Combine methods for best results. Find out what species you have and research the best approach; see Pest Notes: Thrips. Conserve parasites and predators by avoiding persistent pesticides. Avoid overwatering or applying nitrogen fertilizer, which can increase thrips populations. Prune off declining, injured, or infested plant parts. Use row covers or cages over small plants to exclude thrips and other flying insects. Cover soil with reflective mulch, which repels flying thrips, if foliage of growing plants covers less than about half of the soil surface. What about pesticides? Pesticides won’t restore the appearance of injured plant material. Plants remain damaged until injured tissue drops or is pruned off and new growth appears. Thrips are difficult to control with pesticides. Often pesticides won’t be effective unless you wait until the next season and spray new plant growth. Horticultural oils, insecticidal soaps, and pyrethrins can provide temporary control, especially for greenhouse thrips. Spinosad may be more effective. Pesticides alone rarely provide good control, so combine spraying with other methods. ",

    "damagePestNote": "Leaves that become infested before they have developed to their full size often are distorted and remain smaller than healthy ones. Where each scale feeds, brown spots form on the leaf petiole, and yellow or white spots develop on the leaf blade. The pale leaf spots gradually turn brown as the affected tissue dies. Infested leaves can drop prematurely. When sycamore scale feeds on tender bark, it causes the surface of infested twigs and branches to develop a rough texture. Heavy populations exude abundant white wax from bark fissures and cover bark with pale outer skins, which molting scales have shed. When large numbers of scale feed on young tree bark in nurseries or landscapes, it can cause abnormal separation and flaking off of smooth bark from trunks and limbs, resembling the shedding of older, outer bark that is normal in older sycamores. Rough bark on sycamore trees is more commonly caused by the sycamore borer (Synanthedon resplendens). Larvae of this clearwing moth feed under bark, and the granular excrement pellets they push out of tunnels often are obvious in bark crevices and around the basal trunk. No pellets are associated with sycamore scale infestations. See Pest Notes: Clearwing Moths. The impact of scale feeding on a tree’s overall health has not been studied quantitatively. Prolonged feeding by high populations of sycamore scale on either bark or leaves that results in extensive, abnormal bark loss on young trees or in severe, repeated premature leaf drop from trees of any age could stunt tree growth and can cause dieback of twigs and small branches. Other causes of premature leaf drop include sycamore anthracnose and powdery mildew, and these trees can suffer from both sycamore scale and other conditions at the same time. Sycamore anthracnose, however, is a fungal disease that Apiognomonia veneta causes; it leads to browning on all or large portions of leaves, often beginning along leaf veins, as opposed to the small spots characteristic of sycamore scale feeding. Powdery mildew, which the fungus Microsphaera alni causes on sycamore, usually can be recognized by examining affected leaves for the pale fungal growth—the spores and spore-forming structures—characteristic of this disease. See Pest Notes: Anthracnose and Powdery Mildew on Ornamentals . Premature leaf drop also can be due to other pathogenic diseases, abiotic disorders, and other invertebrates. Spider mites such as Oligonychus platani and the western sycamore lace bug (Corythucha confraterna), can cause leaf drop beginning midsummer or later. Look for the tiny, dark green to reddish-brown mites on the upper leaf surface. If lace bugs are the cause, leaves will have specks of black excrement. Lace bugs, found on the underside of leaves, as adults are less than 3/16 inch long and mostly white with translucent and black areas. Nymphs are black with white or yellowish areas. When examining affected leaves, choose ones that are still on the tree. Fresh, partially damaged foliage usually exhibits the most characteristic symptoms and is more likely to harbor live pests.",
    "managementPestNote": "No treatment thresholds for sycamore scale are available. Trees in landscapes probably can tolerate low to moderate levels of infestation without lasting negative impact. Management is complex, because treatment is most effective at bud break before damage is visible. By the time sycamore scale damage is obvious—during spring when leaves distort, in summer when leaves become severely spotted, and anytime leaves drop prematurely—it’s too late to spray effectively. See Monitoring and Chemical Control below. Cultural Control Provide the appropriate growing conditions and cultural requirements for your species of sycamore, and protect trees from injuries. Healthy trees are better able to tolerate pest damage, such as premature leaf drop. Choose pest-resistant cultivars when planting sycamores, such as those resistant to anthracnose or powdery mildew. The best choice varies according to the growing location and how trees will be managed. Although sycamore scale reportedly does not damage P. occidentalis, this species, which is native to the Eastern United States, might not be a good choice for most urban California landscapes. Biological Control Several species of lady beetles feed on sycamore scales. These include the twicestabbed lady beetle (Chilocorus orbus [formerly known as C. stigma]), the pine ladybird (Exochomus quadripustulatus), and Axion plagiatum. Adults and last-instar, or oldest, larvae are about 1/5 inch long. Adults are mostly black with two red to orangish spots on the wing covers of Axion plagiatum and the twicestabbed lady beetle and four yellow to orangish spots on the pine ladybird’s back. Larvae are a mixture of black, brown, gray, and white that varies with the instar’s age and species. Larvae of Axion plagiatum and the twicestabbed lady beetle are distinctly spiny. Monitoring If sycamore scales were a problem the previous spring or summer and you plan to spray, check weekly, beginning in late December, for bud break, which is the best time to make an application. Bud break varies from year to year and among locations. If the pest history from the previous spring and summer is unknown and you are deciding whether to treat, look to see if sycamore scale eggs and nymphs are abundant. Examine the woody areas of the tree, looking for white, cottony “wax” in the cracks of bark and beneath bark plates. Examine waxy bark using a hand lens (20X), or collect waxy bark flakes and examine them under a dissecting binocular microscope. Eggs and nymphs will be oval to oblong or look like yellow to whitish spots within the white, cottony material. Chemical Control Bud break through early leafing out is the most effective time to spray for sycamore scale, because first instars, the stage most susceptible to insecticides, emerge from eggs at the same time as bud break. If scales are abundant and damage cannot be tolerated, apply 1% horticultural oil (narrow-range or supreme) or insecticidal soap. Thoroughly spray branch tips, large limbs, and the trunk using a commercial, high-pressure sprayer. Because of the equipment and experience needed to effectively treat large trees, spraying sycamores usually requires hiring a professional applicator. Other insecticides such as malathion are available for application at bud break; however, these are not recommended, because they can cause secondary outbreaks of other pests in the landscape. Also, pesticide drift or runoff can be more of a concern when spraying trees with this organophosphate insecticide. Once leaves expand spraying is less effective, because it is difficult to thoroughly spray leaf petioles and the undersides of leaves where scales feed. The interfering foliage results in poorer coverage, while leaf hairs protect scales from spray contact. The presence of leaves also increase the amount of material you must apply to achieve coverage. Additionally, many scales will have developed into life stages that are less susceptible to the spray. Combination sprays for disease and scale control Oil sprayed at bud break or early leaf flush helps control powdery mildew disease in addition to sycamore scale. A combination of oil and copper spray (e.g., Bordeaux mixture) or oil combined with chlorothalonil (e.g., Ortho Max Garden Disease Control) can help to control anthracnose disease and scales. Other fungicides also are available for mixing with oil. For more information, consult product labels, and also see Pest Notes: Bordeaux Mixture, Anthracnose and Powdery Mildew on Ornamentals . Systemic insecticides Although soil application of the systemic insecticide imidacloprid has been suggested for managing sycamore scale, there is little research data on its efficacy. In contrast to oil, which must be sprayed to cover the whole tree, home-use systemic products (e.g., Bayer Advanced Garden 12-Month Tree Shrub Insect Control) are relatively easy to mix in a bucket and apply as a soil drench. Professional applicators can apply imidacloprid (Merit and other products) with soil injection equipment. Trees take the pesticide up through their roots. Soil application of imidacloprid is more likely to be effective if applied in late winter or early spring. Application later in the summer, especially where trees are not well irrigated, is unlikely to be effective. Follow all label directions. Trunk injections or implants are not recommended, because they physically injure trees and can mechanically spread pathogens such as the sycamore canker stain fungus that kills sycamore trees.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Termites comprise a large and diverse group of ecologically and economically important insects that feed on cellulose, principally in wood. Worldwide there are over 2,600 species of termites; in California there are at least 23 different species. Although many people associate termites with negative impacts, in nature they make many positive contributions to the world’s ecosystems. In California forests, woodlands, and deserts termites commonly feed on felled trees and stumps, grasses, bushes, or other pieces of dead or decaying wood. Termites can be highly beneficial as they degrade woody debris, return nutrients to the soil, and provide an energy-rich food source to a variety of predators. Their tunneling efforts help to ensure that soils are porous, contain nutrients, and are healthy enough to support plant growth. Termites rarely injure or kill trees. However, a minority of termite species can be very destructive to wood in buildings, including furniture and many other wood-based products. Each year thousands of housing units in California require treatment for the control of these insects. SOCIAL STRUCTURE Termites are different from most other insects in that, like ants, bees, and wasps, they are eusocial and live in colonies or societies that are highly integrated. Eusocial insects are characterized by three traits: (1) Individuals of the same species cooperatively care for immatures; (2) there is a reproductive division of labor with sterile individuals working on behalf of the reproductives; (3) there is an overlap of at least two generations in a colony so that offspring assist parents during their lifetime. Termite colonies can vary in size from only two individuals (a mated pair or incipient colony) to hundreds of thousands or perhaps even millions of individuals. Colonies contain several forms or castes, including larvae or immatures, workers, soldiers, nymphs, and reproductives. These castes can be distinguished by physical characteristics. Worker termites are wingless, soft-bodied, and light caramel in color. They comprise the largest contingent in most colonies and are the individuals most frequently seen when infested wood is examined. Workers are reproductively undeveloped. They are responsible for the care of eggs and immatures; foraging for food; feeding and hygiene of nest mates, including the queen; and construction and maintenance of shelter tubes, galleries, and/or other colonial structures. Workers can also be involved in protection of the colony but are not as fierce as the soldiers. Soldiers can vary greatly in morphology but, generally, have larger, amber or brownish heads and larger mandibles than workers. They guard the colony and defend it against predators. Reproductives, or sexual adults, have yellow-brown or black bodies. At maturity, they initially have two pairs of wings of equal size and are referred to as alates. After their swarming flight they shed their wings and establish new colonies. The queen is largest in physical size, attaining mass several times that of workers. Her main function is to lay eggs, sometimes thousands in a single day. A king or male reproductive is always by her side. In the more primitive termites, other individuals are capable of replacing kings or queens if they die. TYPES OF TERMITES Termite pests in California include subterranean, drywood, and dampwood species. Dampwood termites derive their name from the fact that they live in moist wood, especially in stumps and fallen trees in forests. Drywood termites are common and can survive in very dry conditions, even in dead wood in deserts and do not require much moisture or contact with soil. Subterranean termites are very abundant in most parts of California, even at elevations above 8,000 feet, and live and breed in soil, sometimes many feet below the soil surface. Dampwood Termites Dampwood termites are common throughout the state; however, due to high moisture requirements, they are most often found in cool, humid areas along the coast. They typically infest decayed wood that remains moist either through contact with the soil or exposure to a water leak. Dampwood termites create large, open galleries within the wood where they live and feed. Their presence is significant as an indicator of a moisture problem or wood decay in wooden structures. Drywood Termites In California, with one exception, all species of drywood termites infest dry, sound wood—including structural lumber, dead limbs on trees, utility poles, decks, fences, lumber in storage, and furniture. From this infested wood, winged reproductives periodically swarm to infest additional nearby wood. Drywood termites are most prevalent in southern California, including the desert areas, but also occur along most coastal regions and in the Central Valley. Nests of most species remain entirely above ground and do not connect to the soil. Similar to dampwood termites, feeding by drywood termites can cut across the grain of wood leaving a characteristic pattern of chambers and tunnels, some of which are filled with fecal pellets. Drywood termites often expel their fecal pellets through surface openings and they can accumulate on horizontal surfaces below the openings. These fecal pellets, which are distinctive in appearance with six longitudinal flattened sides, may be the first clue to their presence. For further information on drywood termite biology and management see Pest Note: Drywood Termites . Subterranean Termites Subterranean termites are common throughout California and can be found infesting fallen trees, stumps, or other dead wood in contact with the soil in the forest, landscape, or structural lumber in our houses. The species of economic importance are within the genera Reticulitermes, Heterotermes, and Coptotermes . Other genera of subterranean termites found in California are mostly restricted to the desert areas in the southeastern corner of the state and are generally not important pests. The most common subterranean termites, Reticulitermes, can be encountered in nearly all regions of the state, from the sand dunes of the coast to the upper elevations of the mountain ranges and even in some of the desert areas. The species of Reticulitermes are the most destructive termites found in California. They are small in size compared to dampwood and drywood termites, but mature colonies can contain hundreds of thousands of individuals. Reproductive winged forms of subterranean termites are dark brown to brownish-black with brownish-gray wings. On warm, sunny days following fall or spring rains, swarms of reproductives may be seen emerging en masse from their underground nests. Soldiers are wingless with light caramel-colored bodies and long, narrow amber-colored heads with no eyes. Workers are slightly smaller than reproductives, wingless, and have a shorter head than soldiers; their color is similar to that of soldiers. In the Sonoran Desert of southeastern California, Heterotermes aureus is the most destructive species of subterranean termites. This species has light-brown winged forms that fly in the early evening and are attracted to lights. Another destructive species in this group, the Formosan subterranean termite, Coptotermes formosanus, is native to China but now established in California, thus far restricted to a small area near San Diego. Unlike the native Reticulitermes but similar to Heterotermes, Formosan subterranean termites swarm at dusk and are attracted to lights.",

    "managementPestNote": "It is unlikely that homeowners will be able to execute subterranean termite control on their own. However, it is important for homeowners to have some familiarity with inspection procedures, reduction of conducive conditions, and treatment strategies. Successful termite management requires special skills and knowledge, including a working knowledge of building construction. An understanding of termite biology and identification can help a homeowner understand and select a suitable method of control. Of course, homeowners can replace termite damaged wood and correct conditions conducive to subterranean termite infestation on their own; however, applications of registered pesticides are highly regulated and require a licensed pest control professional to carry out the inspection and control program. Multiple colonies of the same termite species or several different species can infest a building. A professional inspection and an integrated approach to control are required. A combination of methods, such as habitat modification, elimination of excess moisture, removal of infested wood from the structure, exclusion of termites from the building by physical and/or chemical means, and the use of chemical methods to destroy existing colonies will probably be necessary. Inspection An inspection by a licensed pest management professional is required before any treatments can be performed. Most homeowners will be unaware that a subterranean termite problem exists until a significant finding occurs. For instance, an infestation is discovered during an inspection in a real estate transaction, damaged wood is uncovered during a room remodel, a shelter tube appears on an interior or exterior wall, or the sudden appearance of thousands of flying insects in a bathroom or kitchen. These situations are not unusual due to the cryptic and secretive life habits of subterranean termites hidden behind walls or buried away in crawlspaces and under slab foundations. This Pest Note and other resources found on the Internet show photos and images of termites, shelter tubes, and damage that homeowners can reference if they suspect an infestation or if they want more details about the termite inspection process before contacting a pest control professional. However, because the telltale signs of subterranean termites often occur in dark and sometime hazardous locations (attics or tight crawlspaces that have nails, dust, or standing water), it is recommended that you contact a licensed professional for inspection and subsequent treatment. Spring time, especially a warm, sunny day following rain, is the optimal time for subterranean termite swarming behavior and, at least for brief moments during the day, a chance to see live termites and perhaps a specific location where they are emerging from in the home. Since most soil around a home has buried cellulose debris (roots, stumps, or fence posts), finding swarming termites in your yard doesn’t necessarily mean your house has termites. Homes that have had a history of subterranean termite problems can be especially vulnerable to reinfestation and should be inspected by a professional every several years. California, like most states, has nonprofit associations that provide contact information for reputable pest control professionals in your area. Prevention Building design may contribute to the probability of termite invasion. Identify and correct any structural deficiencies that attract or promote subterranean termite infestations. Ideally all substructural wood beneath the building should be kept at least 12 inches above the soil. Consult local building codes for exact, minimum distances from wood to soil. Stucco siding that reaches the ground may promote termite infestations since termites might travel between the stucco and the foundation unseen. Keep foundation areas well ventilated and dry. Reduce chances of infestation by removing any wood in contact with the soil. Inspect porches and other structural or foundation wood for signs of termites. Look for tree stumps, stored lumber, untreated fence posts, and buried scrap wood near the structure that may contribute to a termite infestation. Replacing Lumber in Structures Structural lumber in buildings is usually Douglas-fir, hemlock, or spruce. Of these materials, Douglas-fir is moderately resistant to termites, whereas the other two are not. Lumber used in foundations and other wood in contact with the soil should be chemically treated or naturally resistant to termites and decay to help protect against termite damage in areas where building designs must be altered or concrete cannot be used. When using naturally resistant wood species, we recommend that you request documentation from suppliers to authenticate resistance levels stated on labeling. If susceptible wood is used above the treated wood, however, subterranean termites can build their shelter tubes over chemically treated wood and infest untreated wood above. Use only exterior-grade, pressure-treated lumber for areas that are exposed to weather; otherwise, the chemical in the lumber may leach from the wood. All topical treatments that will be exposed to weather must also have a sealer coat to prevent leaching into the soil following rain. Controlling Subterranean Termites Subterranean termites in structures cannot be controlled using techniques that are appropriate for drywood termites, such as fumigation, heat treatment, freezing, and termite electrocution devices, because the reproductives and a large majority of the termites are concentrated in nests near or below ground level out of reach of these control methods. The primary methods of controlling these termites are insecticides, either applied to the soil adjacent to the structure, directly to nests via shelter tubes, or through bait stations. To facilitate control of subterranean termites, destroy their shelter tubes whenever possible to interrupt access to wooden substructures. Insecticides Liquid applications of pesticides are most often used for subterranean termite control and applied to the soil either in drenches or by injection. There are no reliable over-the-counter termite control products available for the public in California; all effective products are for professional use only. Pest management professionals are provided special training because of the hazards involved in applying insecticides to the soil around and under buildings. Applications in the wrong place can cause insecticide contamination of heating ducts and/or damage to radiant heat pipes or plumbing used for water or sewage under the treated building. Soil type, weather, and application techniques influence the mobility of insecticides in the soil; soil-applied insecticides must not leach through the soil profile to contaminate groundwater or run off to contaminate surface water. Recently, active ingredients used to control subterranean termites in soils were broadly classified as repellent or nonrepellent. Subterranean termites can detect repellent insecticides, usually pyrethroids; and they are repelled without receiving a dose that would kill them. Because of this negative reaction, termiticide products containing repellent active ingredients have been phased out. Newly introduced chemicals are available that are less toxic to humans and other mammals than the older insecticides but remain highly toxic to insects. These insecticides, including chlorantraniliprole, fipronil, and imidacloprid are nonrepellent to termites and have been shown to be effective in killing termites at low dosage rates under California’s climatic conditions. Depending on the label language, these materials are used as barriers as described above and also as local treatments, targeting nests directly via shelter tubes. Baiting Subterranean termite baits, which are slow-acting insecticides consumed during feeding and shared within the colony, are commercially available in California. Generally, bait is delivered within a cellulose or wood matrix infused with the active ingredient and installed underground at regular intervals around a structure. Commercial bait products are also available for above-ground use, where there is no soil for in-ground station installation. This method of controlling termites is very appealing because it doesn’t require extensive site preparation, such as trenching, or extensive application of insecticides to the soil or structure, and because the most effective baits use insect growth regulators (IGRs) to suppress or destroy the entire colony. IGRs have very low toxicity to humans and their pets. The most effective bait products, however, are available for professional use only.",

    "damagePestNote": "Injury is limited to squash, pumpkin, melon, and other plants in the cucurbit family. Adults and nymphs cause damage by sucking plant juices. Leaves lose nutrients and water and become speckled, later turning yellow to brown. Under heavy feeding, plants begin to wilt, and the point of attack becomes black and brittle. Small plants can be killed completely, while larger cucurbits begin to lose runners. The wilting resembles bacterial wilt, which is a disease spread by another pest of squash, the cucumber beetle. The wilting caused by squash bugs is not a true disease. Squash bugs may feed on developing fruits, causing scarring and death of young fruit.",
    "managementPestNote": "In spring, search for squash bugs hidden under debris, near buildings and in perennial plants in the garden. Inspect young plants daily for signs of egg masses, mating adults, or wilting. Place wooden boards throughout the garden and check under them every morning, then destroy any squash bugs found. Cultural Practices The best method for control is prevention through sanitation. Remove old cucurbit plants after harvest. Keep the garden free from rubbish and debris that can provide overwintering sites for squash bugs. At the end of the gardening season, compost all vegetation or thoroughly till it under. Handpick or vacuum any bugs found under wooden boards. During the growing season, pick off and destroy egg masses as soon as you see them. Use protective covers such as plant cages or row covers in gardens where squash bugs have been a problem in the past and remove covers at bloom to allow for pollination. Trellising Using a trellis for vining types of squash and melons can make them less vulnerable to squash bug infestation. Resistant Varieties Some squash varieties, including Butternut, Royal Acorn, and Sweet Cheese, are more resistant to squash bugs. Biological Control The parasitic tachinid fly Trichopoda pennipes, which lays its eggs on squash bugs, has been introduced into California and may be found in some gardens. Look for the eggs of this parasite on the undersides of squash bugs. Chemical Control Squash bugs are difficult to kill using insecticides because egg masses, nymphs, and bugs are often hidden near the crown of the plant and difficult to reach with sprays. Several insecticides are available that are less toxic to the environment including products containing soaps and oils such as neem oil, horticultural oil, and canola oil. These soaps and oils are most effective on the smallest nymphs, but good penetration throughout the canopy is essential so that nymphs under the leaves and deep within plants will be covered. Other more toxic pesticides are also registered for use on squash bugs; however, these materials should be used with caution because of negative impacts on bees and beneficial insects such as predators and parasites that help to keep other pest insects and mites in check. In addition, they are not likely to give better control than handpicking combined with softer chemicals.",

    "damagePestNote": "Most springtails are harmless scavengers, feeding mainly on decaying organic matter. Some species may damage plants by chewing on the roots and leaves of seedlings. The seedlings may appear wilted and may die if damaged when young. Damage occurs as minute, rounded pits on young leaves or roots, or as irregular holes in thin leaves. Mature plants are not significantly injured. Springtails rarely cause enough damage to plants to warrant control measures. Springtails can become a nuisance around swimming pools when they fall in and drown in large numbers, often coating the pool surface. Although unsightly in the pool, they can be safely removed without cause for concern. Springtails will not bite or otherwise harm people or pets. Their large populations can also make them a nuisance in homes, greenhouses, and other locations where there is a source of moisture. Their continued presence indoors is an indicator of moisture.",
    "managementPestNote": "The key to managing springtails is to reduce moisture and excess organic matter in gardens, plant pots, and around building foundations. Also screen or caulk cracks that provide entryways for springtails into homes. Pesticides should not be necessary and won’t provide long-term control by themselves. Environmental Modification Outside the house, eliminate breeding sites by removing excessive mulch and moist leaves around the foundation. Low, moist places near the house or in the crawl space of the building should be dried out. Do not overwater mulched landscape plants, and let the soil dry slightly between waterings. Where springtails have been a problem in vegetable gardens, provide good drainage, reduce irrigation, and reduce application of organic amendments. Inside the home, springtails can be controlled by airing out and drying infested areas. The use of a fan can speed up the process. Water leaks or other sources of excess moisture should be repaired. Springtails in indoor potted plants can be controlled by avoiding overwatering and by allowing the soil to dry out between waterings. Do not allow drain water to stand in saucers between waterings. In sinks and bathtubs, simply wash the insects down the drain. Never pour or spray insecticides down the drains. Exclusion and Sanitation Springtails are attracted to light and are so small that they can enter houses through cracks and crevices such as around doors, utility pipes, or window screens. Repair torn screens and close up places where the springtails can enter the house, such as spaces under doors and around windows and attic or basement vents. Use caulk, weather stripping, fine-mesh screen, steel wool, or expandable foam as appropriate. Springtails that enter the home may be controlled by sweeping or vacuuming. Repeat as needed. Swimming Pools Springtails in the pool will be removed by normal pool filtering or can be manually removed using a pool skimmer. Limiting lush vegetation and mulch around the edge of the pool may reduce recurring problems. Chemical Control Insecticide sprays are generally not recommended for springtail management. They are often no more effective than vacuuming, and repeated applications may be required. At best, pesticides will provide only temporary relief if the conditions favorable for springtail development are not corrected. Pyrethroid insecticides are available for treating foundation walls around the perimeter of buildings. If required, these applications are best done by a professional. Special care must be taken to avoid run-off of pesticides from walls and foundations into storm drains, because they lead directly into creeks and rivers.",

It also has been observed occasionally attacking other soft-flesh fruit such as plums, plumcots, nectarines, and figs when conditions are right.",
    "damagePestNote": "Unlike other vinegar flies that occur in California, spotted wing drosophila attacks healthy ripening fruit as well as damaged or split fruit. The female will penetrate the skin of soft-skinned fruit with her large ovipositor and lay eggs just under the skin, creating a small puncture, or “sting,” on the fruit surface. Each sting contains 1 to 3 eggs, and a female can oviposit on many fruit. Multiple larvae within a single fruit are quite possible, because many females might visit the same fruit to oviposit. Once fruit integrity is compromised by SWD’s activities, common vinegar flies also might oviposit in the damaged fruit. Eggs hatch and maggots develop and feed inside the fruit, causing the flesh to turn brown and soft with sunken areas that can exude fluid on the surface of smooth-skinned fruit such as cherries and blueberries. Damage can provide an entry site for infection by secondary fungal and bacterial pathogens, but this is not always the case.",
    "managementPestNote": "Spotted wing drosophila flies and their damage often are not noticed in backyard fruit crops until fruit is being harvested. Sprays at this time will not protect the crop, because maggots already are in the fruit. If a small percentage of fruit is infested, you can salvage some of the crop by harvesting the crop immediately and sorting and removing fruit with stings on the surface. Place infested fruit in a sturdy, sealed plastic bag and dispose of it in the trash. A combination of preventive and cultural practices, discussed below in Cultural Control, might be useful for reducing problems on fruit trees and berries. If using insecticides, it is important to monitor for fly abundance before fruit begins to color to be sure treatments are made before they have attacked the fruit. Varietal Susceptibility Some cherry varieties might be more susceptible to SWD than others, but more research is required. Among the berries, raspberries appear to be the most susceptible; blackberries and strawberries also are susceptible in coastal climates under very moist conditions when fruit is not harvested frequently. Blueberries also are quite attractive to SWD in moist, coastal environments but less so where moisture is lacking and temperatures are high. All blueberry varieties appear to be susceptible. Cultural Control Sanitation Eliminating any fruit that has fallen on the ground and any infested fruit remaining on plants in the garden can reduce populations of flies that might infest next year’s crops or later-ripening varieties. Infested fruit can be placed in a durable plastic bag, sealed, and placed in the trash. Composting or burying is not a reliable way to destroy eggs and larvae in fruit. Solarizing fruit under clear plastic in the sunshine has been quite successful in killing flies in fruit in preliminary studies performed in Oregon. Netting Fine netting over whole plants or canes can be useful to keep flies from attacking fruit on blueberries and other small fruit and possibly on branches on small cherry trees. However the netting must be applied before fruit begins to ripen so that flies will not be caught inside the net. Netting must be secured so flies cannot enter, and the mesh size should be very small, such as 0.98 mm mesh used for screening out no-see-um flies. Early Harvest Early harvest of fruit can be important in reducing exposure of fruit to the pest. Begin harvest as early as you can and continue to remove fruit as soon as they ripen. Trapping Trapping, as discussed below in Monitoring for SWD, has not been shown to effectively reduce populations of SWD in backyard trees. Trapping is important, however, for monitoring for the pest. Monitoring for SWD It is very important to monitor for SWD activity in your susceptible fruit trees and berries. You can use traps to monitor for flies, but it is also important to observe cherry or blueberry fruit regularly as it begins to ripen. In some cases, this will allow you to harvest before problems are serious. Monitoring also will help you time insecticide applications for greatest effect. Start checking cherry or blueberry fruit for damage (i.e., prematurely rotting fruit or punctures created when the female lays eggs in fruit) as soon as fruit begins to develop any pink color. SWD stings are tiny, so a magnifying glass will help you see them. You can gently squeeze the fruit to see if juice leaks from the small punctures; this can indicate presence of the pest. Break open suspect fruit to see if small, white larvae are inside. If you find infected fruit you should either harvest all the fruit immediately or spray to prevent the damage from increasing before harvest. The infestation level can increase quite rapidly if fruit are left untreated or unharvested. Remove and destroy infested fruit as you monitor. Stings are not readily visible on raspberries, blackberries, and strawberries, so it is difficult to detect an early infestation by monitoring the fruit for damage. You also can use traps to detect and monitor SWD adults. Commercial fruit fly traps are available or you can make traps out of 1-quart plastic yogurt (or similar) containers that have a lid. Drill 10 to 16 holes that are 3/16-inch in diameter around the upper side of the container for fly entry. Bait the trap with 1 to 2 inches of pure apple cider vinegar; avoid flavored apple cider vinegars. Add a drop of unscented liquid dishwashing soap to break the surface tension so the flies will drown. Hang the trap in the shade in your cherry tree or near your berries in early May or well before fruit begins to ripen. Check the trap weekly for small flies with dark spots at the tip of their wings floating in the fluid. These are male spotted wing drosophila and will confirm that you have the pest. Put fresh apple cider vinegar and a drop of soap in each week. Chemical Control Because this pest is so new to California, there has been limited research on treatments to manage spotted wing drosophila. Before you spray, confirm that you have SWD in your area by hanging out traps or checking fruit. Sprays must be timed to kill adults before they lay eggs, as sprays will not control larvae already in the fruit. Always read product labels to make sure pesticides are registered for use on the fruit or berry you are treating. If monitoring indicates a need to spray, the application should be made as soon as the fruit just begins to turn from yellow to pink. This should be about 2 to 3 weeks before cherry or berry harvest. A second application may be needed 7 to 10 days later. In the case of indeterminate fruiting berries such as raspberries or strawberries, sprays might need to be repeated to keep populations low during summer and fall. You can use monitoring traps to help you decide if and when additional sprays might be needed. Be sure to wait the interval specified on the pesticide label before harvesting fruit. The insecticide spinosad (e.g., Monterey Garden Insect Spray) is effective and has the least negative environmental effects of currently available products. Some spinosad products are sold to be applied with a hose-end sprayer, but a compressed-air sprayer will give more reliable coverage. The organophosphate insecticide malathion also will control spotted wing drosophila, but malathion is very toxic to bees and natural enemies of other pests in the garden so care must be taken to keep the application on the target plant and avoid drift and runoff. Improper application also can result in injury to cherry trees. Because of the potential negative impact of malathion in the garden, use it only where you are certain you will have a spotted wing drosophila infestation, either because you had a problem last year or from trapping and positively identifying insects this season as SWD.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Remember that spiders are primarily beneficial and their activities should be encouraged in the garden. Pesticide control is difficult and rarely necessary. The best approach to controlling spiders in and around the home is to remove hiding spots for secretive spiders such as black widows and regularly clean webs off the house with brushes and vacuums. Prevention and Nonchemical Control Spiders may enter houses and other structures through cracks and other openings. They also may be carried in on items like plants, firewood, and boxes. Regular vacuuming or sweeping of windows, corners of rooms, storage areas, basements, and other seldom used areas helps remove spiders and their webs. Vacuuming spiders can be an effective control technique because their soft bodies usually do not survive this process. Indoors, a web on which dust has gathered is an old web that is no longer being used by a spider. Individual spiders can also be removed from indoor areas by placing a jar over them and slipping a piece of paper under the jar that then seals off the opening of the jar when it is lifted up. To prevent spiders from coming indoors, seal cracks in the foundation and other parts of the structure and gaps around windows and doors. Good screening not only will keep out many spiders but also will discourage them by keeping out insects that they must have for food. In indoor storage areas, place boxes off the floor and away from walls, whenever possible, to help reduce their usefulness as a harborage for spiders. Sealing the boxes with tape will prevent spiders from taking up residence within. Clean up clutter in garages, sheds, basements, and other storage areas. Be sure to wear gloves to avoid accidental bites. Outdoors, eliminate places for spiders to hide and build their webs by keeping the area next to the foundation free of trash, leaf litter, heavy vegetation, and other accumulations of materials. Trimming plant growth away from the house and other structures will discourage spiders from first taking up residence near the structure and then moving indoors. Outdoor lighting attracts insects, which in turn attracts spiders. If possible, keep lighting fixtures off structures and away from windows and doorways. Sweep, mop, hose, or vacuum webs and spiders off buildings regularly. Insecticides will not provide long-term control and should not generally be used against spiders outdoors. Chemical Control Typically pesticide control of spiders is difficult unless you actually see the spider and are able to spray it. There are various insecticides available in retail outlets labeled for spider control, including pyrethrins, resmethrin, allethrin, or combinations of these products. If you spray a spider, it will be killed only if the spray lands directly on it; the spray residual does not have a long-lasting effect. This means a spider can walk over a sprayed surface a few days (and in many cases, a few hours) after treatment and not be affected. Control by spraying is only temporary unless accompanied by housekeeping. It is just as easy and much less toxic to crush the spider with a rolled up newspaper or your shoe or to vacuum it up. Sticky traps offer a noninsecticidal way to remove spiders from your home as long as you can place the traps where pets and curious children can’t tamper with them. Sorptive dusts containing amorphous silica gel (silica aerogel) and pyrethrins, which can be applied by professional pest control applicators only, may be useful in certain indoor situations. Particles of the dust affect the outer covering of spiders (and also insects) that have crawled over a treated surface, causing them to dry out. When applied as a dustlike film and left in place, a sorptive dust provides permanent protection against spiders. The dust is most advantageously used in cracks and crevices and in attics, wall voids, and other enclosed or unused places.\tHEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF MANAGEMENT ALTERNATIVES —from California Department of Pesticide Regulation",

    "contentQuickTips": "Spiders are mostly beneficial because they feed on pest insects. However, many people think that all spiders are dangerous and aggressive. In California, the main spider capable of causing serious injury is the black widow, which generally remains outdoors and out of sight. Spiders seen out in the open during the day are unlikely to bite people. Focus pest management efforts on removing webs and hiding places. Pesticides are not generally recommended. What to know about spiders: The jaws of most spiders are too small to bite humans. Adult female black widows are the main spiders capable of seriously injuring people in California. They are shiny black with a red hourglass marking on the underside and are commonly found outdoors, in sheltered, dry, undisturbed areas such as wood piles and garages. Anyone bitten by a black widow spider should remain calm and seek medical advice. The brown recluse spider and the hobo spider do not live in California. Some other spiders bite when trapped in clothing or bedding, but the effect is usually no more severe than itching or the reaction to a bee sting. To prevent spiders from entering your house, take these steps: Seal home foundation cracks and other access holes. Inspect window and door screens for good seals to keep out spiders and the insects they prey on. Keep areas around home foundations free of clutter. Manage spiders using these tips: Indoors, regular housecleaning provides adequate spider control. Vacuum up the spider and its web. Alternatively, squash spiders or capture them in a jar and release them outside. Prevent clutter buildup that can provide spider hiding places both indoors and out. Remove spider webs from the exterior of the house with a broom or high pressure hose. Spiders and biological control: When removing spiders, don’t overlook the fact that spiders eat a large number and variety of nuisance and pest insects. Spiders also have natural enemies—wasps, other spiders, birds, reptiles, and others—that sometimes keep them from becoming too numerous.",

The brown garden snail, Cornu aspersum (formerly Helix aspersa), is the most common snail causing problems in California gardens. It was introduced from France during the 1850s for use as food. Another damaging snail is the white garden snail, Theba pisana. It is currently an established pest only in San Diego County but has been found in Los Angeles and Orange counties as well. Common species of slugs that injure landscape plants include: the gray garden slug, Deroceras reticulatum (formerly Agriolimax reticulatus); the banded slug, Lehmannia poirieri ; the three-band garden slug, L. valentiana ; the tawny slug, Limacus flavus ; and the greenhouse slug, Milax gagates .",

    "damagePestNote": "Snails and slugs feed on a variety of living plants and on decaying plant matter. They create irregular holes with smooth edges on leaves and flowers by scraping with their rasp-like tongues. Small succulent plant parts are easily clipped by snail and slug feeding. Because they prefer succulent foliage or flowers, snails and slugs are primarily pests of seedlings and herbaceous plants. They are also serious pests of turfgrass seedlings and ripening fruits that are close to the ground, such as strawberries and tomatoes. Snails and slugs will also feed on the young plant bark and foliage and fruit of some trees. Citrus are especially susceptible to damage. Snail and slug damage can be confused with feeding by other pests such as earwigs, caterpillars, or other chewing insects. Look for silvery mucous trails to confirm that slugs or snails caused the damage, rather than other pests.",
    "managementPestNote": "A good snail and slug management program relies on a combination of methods. The first step is to eliminate, as much as possible, all places where they can hide during the day. Boards, stones, debris, weedy areas around tree trunks, leafy branches growing close to the ground, and dense ground covers, such as ivy, are ideal sheltering spots. Though baits can be part of a management program, it is best to use them in conjunction with habitat modification, especially in gardens that contain plenty of shelter, food, and moisture. Cultural Control It will not be possible to eliminate some shelters, such as low ledges on fences, the undersides of wooden decks, and water meter boxes, so make a regular practice of trapping and removing snails and slugs from these areas. Place vegetable gardens or susceptible plants as far away from snail and slug hiding areas as possible. Reducing hiding places allows fewer snails and slugs to survive. The survivors congregate in the remaining shelters, where you can more easily locate and remove them. Switching from sprinkler irrigation to drip irrigation will reduce humidity and moist surfaces, making the habitat less favorable for these pests. Irrigating near sunrise will reduce the amount of time that foliage and ground are moist. Solarizing the soil—a technique that uses a clear plastic tarp and the sun's heat—is a good way to kill eggs in raised beds. See the Pest Notes : Soil Solarization for Gardens and Landscapes for more information. Eggs will also rapidly dry if on the soil surface. If snail eggs are detected in the bed or garden, shallow cultivation will bring them to the soil surface to dry out. Susceptible and resistant plants. Plant selection can greatly affect how difficult your battle with snails and slugs will be. Because snails and slugs favor seedlings and plants with succulent foliage, you will need to vigilantly protect them. Some plants these pests will seriously damage include basil, beans, cabbage, dahlia, delphinium, hosta, lettuce, marigolds, strawberries, and many other vegetable plants. Choose plants that are not attractive to snails and slugs for areas where they are dense. Examples are plants with highly scented foliage, such as lavender, rosemary, and sage and some commonly grown plants including ferns, cyclamen, hydrangea, California poppy, nasturtium, and lantana. Most ornamental woody plants and ornamental grasses are also not seriously damaged by snails and slugs but can be a hiding place for them during the day. Nevertheless, if you design your landscape using snail- and slug-resistant plants, you are likely to have very limited damage. Hand-picking. Hand-picking can be very effective if done thoroughly on a regular basis. At first you should look for snails and slugs daily, paying careful attention to potential hiding places. After the population has noticeably declined, weekly hand-picking can be sufficient. To draw out snails and slugs, water the infested area in the late afternoon. After dark, search them out using a flashlight, pick them up (rubber or latex gloves are recommended), place them in a plastic bag, and seal and dispose of them in the trash. You also can put them in a bucket with soapy water or diluted ammonia (5 to 10% solution) and dispose of them after they are dead. Alternatively, crush captured snails and leave them in the garden. Traps. You can trap snails and slugs beneath boards or flower pots that you position throughout the garden and landscape. Inverted melon rinds also make good traps. Construct wooden traps using 12- by 15-inch boards (or any easy-to-handle size) raised off the ground by 1-inch runners. The runners make it easy for the pests to crawl underneath. Scrape off the accumulated snails and slugs daily and destroy them (see hand-picking). Do not use salt to destroy snails and slugs, as it will increase soil salinity. Some people use beer-baited traps buried at ground level to catch and drown slugs and snails that fall into them. Because it is the fermented part of the product that attracts these pests, you can also use a sugar-water and yeast mixture instead of beer (see Cranshaw, 1997). Beer/yeast traps attract slugs and snails within an area of only a few feet, and you must replenish the bait every few days to keep the level deep enough to drown the mollusks. Traps must have deep vertical sides to keep the snails and slugs from crawling out and a top to reduce evaporation. These types of traps are available at garden supply stores, or you can make your own by burying a coffee can, margarine container, or plastic bottle with the top at ground level and placing a lid with holes cut into it over the container. Barriers. Several types of barriers will keep snails and slugs out of planting beds. The easiest to maintain are those made with copper flashing and screen. It is believed that copper barriers are effective because the copper reacts with the slime that snails and slugs secrete, causing a disruption in their nervous system similar to an electric shock. When erecting vertical copper screens, it is best to use a strip that is at least 2 inches tall so you can bury a portion of it 1 to 2 inches below the soil to prevent slugs from crawling beneath the barrier. Copper foil or tape wrapped around planting boxes, headers, or trunks will repel snails until it becomes tarnished. If the bands do tarnish, you can clean them with a vinegar solution. When banding tree trunks, wrap the copper foil around the trunk and cut it to allow an 8-inch overlap. Attach one end or the middle of the band to the trunk with one staple oriented parallel to the trunk. Overlap and fasten the ends with one or two large paper clips to allow the copper band to slide as the trunk grows. When using copper bands on planter boxes, be sure the soil within the boxes is snail-free before applying them. If this is not the case, hand-pick and remove any snails and slugs that are present after applying the band (but before planting new plants) until the box is free of these pests. Barriers of dry diatomaceous earth, heaped in a band 1 inch high and 3 inches wide around the garden, can also be effective. However, these barriers lose their effectiveness after becoming damp, making them difficult to maintain and not very useful in most garden situations. Crushed egg shells or coffee grounds have not been shown to be effective deterrents. Biological Control Snails and slugs have many natural enemies, including ground beetles, rats, pathogens, snakes, toads, turtles, and both domestic and wild birds. Most are rarely effective enough to provide satisfactory control in the garden. One predator found in some California gardens is a large Staphylinid beetle called the devil's coach horse, Ocypus olens. However, this beetle, which is more than an inch long, will also feed on ripening or decaying fruits and vegetables. Domesticated fowl (such as ducks, geese, or chickens) kept penned in infested areas can be effective snail predators that significantly reduce problems. Seedlings must be protected from feeding damage from these birds. The predatory decollate snail, Rumina decollata, is used in Southern California citrus groves and other crops, gardens, and landscapes to control young brown garden snails and can provide very effective biological control. Decollate snails can also feed on seedlings, small plants, and flowers, although they are less problematic than brown snails. Snail baits will kill decollate snails. You should not use baits where these predators are active. Because of the potential impact of the decollate snail on certain endangered mollusk species, it legally cannot be released in California outside of Fresno, Imperial, Kern, Los Angeles, Madera, Orange, Riverside, Santa Barbara, San Bernardino, San Diego, Ventura, and Tulare counties. Even in counties where decollate snails are permitted, they should not be introduced in or near natural areas because of the potential danger to endangered native snails. Chemical Control Several types of snail and slug bait products (molluscicides) are available. Snail and slug baits can be effective when used properly and in conjunction with a cultural program that incorporates the other methods discussed above. Baits alone will not effectively control snails or slugs in the long term. Baits are also toxic to all snails and slugs, including the predatory decollate snail and native species. Iron phosphate baits—available under many trade names, including Sluggo and Slug Magic, have the advantage of being safer for use around children, domestic animals, birds, fish, and other wildlife. Some formulations are listed as acceptable for use for organic systems. They are a good choice for an integrated pest management (IPM) program in your garden. Ingesting even small amounts of the bait will cause snails and slugs to stop feeding, although it can take several days to a week for the snails to die. Snails and slugs tend to hide under plants or in other dark areas before they die, so you will not see scattered empty shells or dead snails and slugs as you would if treating them with metaldehyde. Some formulations of iron phosphate include the insecticide spinosad to increase the spectrum of pests controlled (e.g. Sluggo Plus). Spinosad is an insecticide that will control earwigs and cutworms. These products can also be used in organic systems. Products that contain ferric sodium EDTA (e.g. Eliminator Snail and Slug Killer or newer boxes of Corry’s Snail and Slug Killer), work in a similar manner to iron phosphate but are somewhat faster, killing snails in three days instead of seven. EDTA is used to make the ferric (which is also iron) more available and, therefore, kills the mollusks faster. Products containing ferric sodium EDTA are not labeled for organic use. Molluscicides that have sulfur as the active ingredient (e.g. Bug-Geta Snail & Slug Killer 2) also reduce feeding damage caused by snails and slugs, but to a lesser extent than the iron-based products. Baits containing the active ingredient metaldehyde are common. However, metaldehyde baits are particularly poisonous to dogs and cats, and the pelleted form can be attractive to dogs. Do not use metaldehyde snail baits where children and pets could encounter them. Avoid getting metaldehyde bait on plants, especially vegetables. Metaldehyde baits containing 4% active ingredient are more effective than those containing only 2%. Some metaldehyde products are formulated with carbaryl, partly to increase the spectrum of pests controlled, such as soil- and debris-dwelling insects, spiders, and sowbugs. Carbaryl is toxic to earthworms and to soil-inhabiting beneficial insects, such as ground beetles; therefore, it is better to avoid using snail baits containing this active ingredient. Baits containing only metaldehyde are most reliable when temperatures are warm or during periods of lower humidity. The pests usually die within one day of ingesting the chemical or getting it on their foot. If cool, wet weather follows the baiting, they can recover if they ingest a sublethal dose. Some metaldehyde baits break down rapidly when exposed to sunlight and high moisture from rain or irrigation. If high rainfall or irrigation is unavoidable, look for products that say they are rainfast or resistant to moisture breakdown on the label. Placement of baits. For any of the baits, sprinkle them on the soil in areas that snails and slugs regularly frequent, near but not on plants that are attractive to the pests or near pest hiding places such as irrigation boxes. Applying baits repeatedly in the same areas maximizes control, because mollusks tend to return to food source sites. Never pile bait in mounds or clumps, especially those products that are more hazardous. Piling makes bait attractive to pets and children and is not as effective as sprinkling. Piles also tend to clump when wetted, making them less effective. The timing of any baiting is critical. Baiting is less effective during very hot, very dry, or cold times of the year because snails and slugs are less active during these periods. Applying the bait in the late afternoon or evening when snails and slugs are active will take advantage of the nighttime feeding habits of these pests and will improve the success of baiting. Light irrigation will improve the success of baiting because it encourages snails and slugs to forage. However, do not water heavily after bait placement, as high moisture often makes the pellets moldy and less attractive to the pests. Sprinkle bait close to walls and fences, or in other moist and protected locations, or scatter it along areas that snails and slugs cross to get from sheltered areas to the garden.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Pests in Gardens and Landscapes: Quick Tips Snails and Slugs Published 9/18 Read more and see videos on this topic Snails and slugs rank among our most despised garden pests. These slimy mollusks emerge from hiding at night and chew holes in leaves and flowers of many succulent garden plants and fruit. Slugs and snails are similar in structure and biology, except slugs lack the snails’ external spiral shell. Management requires a vigilant and integrated approach that includes eliminating moisture and hiding spots, trapping, setting up barriers, and handpicking. Baits can be helpful but by themselves don’t provide adequate control in gardens that contain plenty of shelter, food, and moisture. How do you know snails and slugs are causing damage? Because they feed at night and hide during the day, you might not observe these pests at first. Go out at night or in the early morning to view them in action. Other pests can cause holes in leaves, flowers, and fruit. Look for the shiny slime trails slugs and snails leave behind. What can be done to reduce snails and slugs? Remove daytime hiding places such as ivy, weedy areas, debris, and boards. Place your garden in the sunniest spot possible. Remove garden objects, plants, or ground cover that can serve as shady shelter. Reduce moist surfaces by switching to drip irrigation or by running sprinklers in the morning rather than later in the day. Make sure the garden is mollusk-free before planting, then erect a copper barrier around it. Use a 4- to 6- inch-wide band of copper, buried an inch below the soil and bent over at the top or attached around the edge of a raised bed. Consider snail-proof plants such as impatiens, geraniums, lantana, nasturtiums, and other plants with stiff leaves and highly scented foliage such as sage, rosemary, and lavender. How can I manage snails and slugs without using pesticides? Regularly remove snails from shelters such as fence ledges, undersides of decks, and meter boxes. Build a trap using a board raised off the ground by 1-inch runners. As mollusks collect under the board, scrape them off and destroy daily. Place beer traps in your garden and dispose of trapped snails and slugs daily. What about pesticides? Pesticide baits will not be very effective unless you also remove shelter, food, and moisture. Iron phosphate baits are safe for use around dogs, children, and wildlife. Ferric sodium EDTA is a newer active ingredient that works similar to iron phosphate. This product is not organically acceptable. Metaldehyde baits are especially poisonous to dogs and birds. Metaldehyde also loses its effectiveness rapidly in sunlight and after rain or irrigation. Irrigate before applying bait and apply in the evening on warm days when mollusks are active. Scatter, don't pile, bait around sprinklers and in moist, protected areas where mollusks travel. Always read pesticide labels before applying the product. ",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Scorpions are nocturnal, predatory animals that feed on a variety of insects, spiders, centipedes, and other scorpions. Large scorpions occasionally feed on vertebrates such as small lizards, snakes, and mice. Most scorpions live in warm, dry climates, and many of the species found in North America occur in Arizona, adjacent areas of California, and parts of New Mexico.

    "damagePestNote": "The effect of a scorpion's sting depends primarily on the species of scorpion involved. The sting of scorpions in Vaejovis and Hadrurus genera is usually no more serious than stings of ants, bees, or wasps, unless a person has an allergic reaction. Normal reactions include an immediate intense, localized, burning sensation with little redness or swelling; symptoms usually subside after about 30 minutes. The sting of a bark scorpion, however, can be serious, producing severe pain and swelling at the site of the sting, numbness, frothing at the mouth, difficulty breathing, respiratory paralysis, muscle twitching, and convulsions. These symptoms are signs for the need of immediate medical attention. Especially at risk are children and the elderly. In California, the bark scorpion occurs only in the extreme southeastern part of the state, along the Arizona border. Anyone stung by a bark scorpion or experiencing an allergic reaction to a sting should seek medical attention. Keep the sting victim calm and relaxed, and don't allow the consumption of alcohol or other sedatives. It may be helpful to apply pressure compression as well as an ice pack to the sting site. Capture the scorpion for identification if you can do it without risking your safety. Antivenins are available to treat severe reactions to stings. Death from scorpion sting is rare, because stinging encounters are uncommon and antivenin is effective. During a 10-month period in the Southwest, physicians reported 1,573 cases of scorpion stings. The last reported death in Arizona, where scorpions are common, was in 1948.",
    "managementPestNote": "To prevent stinging encounters with scorpions, don't leave shoes, boots, clothing items, or wet towels outdoors where scorpions can hide. Shake towels around the swimming pool and shake all clothing and shoes before putting them on. Wear gloves when working in the yard. Wear shoes outdoors, especially during the evening hours. A portable black light (UV light) may be used to survey for scorpions in and around the home. Scorpions glow brightly under black light and are therefore easily found and removed.\tHow to safely capture a scorpion\tScorpions can be captured by placing a quart-sized glass jar over the scorpion and sliding a sheet of heavy construction paper under the jar. With the sheet of paper securely over the mouth of the jar, invert the jar; the scorpion will fall to the bottom of the jar. Screw a secure lid over the mouth of the jar. Scorpions can also be picked up safely with forceps that are 10 to 12 inches long, or with other long mechanical devices made for picking up small objects, and placed in a glass jar secured with a screwtype lid. Glue boards measuring 8 x 5 1/4 inches may also be useful in trapping scorpions.\tScorpions can enter buildings through openings around plumbing fixtures and loose-fitting doors and windows as well as cracks in foundations and walls. Outdoor lights attract insects and thus the scorpions that feed on insects. Yellow outdoor lighting is less attractive to insects and is recommended in areas where scorpions are prevalent. The first strategy for control is to modify the area surrounding a house, because scorpions are difficult to control with insecticides. Use the following checklist to protect your home:\tClean the yard by removing all trash, logs, boards, stones, bricks, and other objects from around the foundation of the home.\tPrune overhanging tree branches away from the house, because they can provide a path to the roof for scorpions.\tDon't store firewood inside the house; bring in only wood to be directly placed on the fire, and check for scorpions before bringing the wood inside.\tInstall weatherstripping around loose-fitting doors and windows.\tCaulk around roof eaves, pipes, and any other cracks that allow entrance into the home.\tMake sure window screens fit tightly in the window frame, and keep the screens in good repair.\tPesticides aren't always effective against scorpions, because they hide in cracks and crevices during daylight hours. Adult scorpions are more difficult to kill with pesticides because of their larger body size and thicker cuticle. Read and follow label directions, and use pesticides only in combination with other control measures outlined above. Don't overuse pesticides out of frustration just because they appear to be working too slowly at label rates of application. If you choose to use pesticides, apply them to exterior walls around the foundation of the house from the ground up to 1 foot; also make applications around doors, window eaves, and other potential points of entry. Follow directions on the package for dosage, mixing, and application methods.",

The presence of scales can be easily overlooked, in part because they do not resemble most other insects.",
    "damagePestNote": "Some scale species, when abundant, weaken a plant and cause it to grow slowly. Infested plants appear water stressed, leaves turn yellow and may drop prematurely, and plant parts that remain heavily infested may die. The dead brownish leaves may remain on scale-killed branches, giving plants a scorched appearance. If the scale produces honeydew, this sticky excrement, sooty mold, and the ants attracted to honeydew can annoy people even when scales are not harming the plant. The importance of infestations depends on the scale species, the plant species and cultivar, environmental factors, and natural enemies. Populations of some scales can increase dramatically within a few months when the weather is warm, and honeydew-seeking ants protect scales from their natural enemies. Plants are not harmed by a few scales and even high populations of certain species apparently do not damage plants.",
    "managementPestNote": "Many species are usually well controlled by beneficial predators and parasites (natural enemies). Exceptions are when natural enemies are disrupted by ants, dust, or the application of persistent broad-spectrum insecticides. Preserving (conserving) parasites and predators (such as by controlling pest-tending ants) may be enough to bring about gradual control of certain scales as natural enemies become more abundant. A well-timed and thorough spray of horticultural (narrow-range) oil during the dormant season, or soon after scale crawlers are active in late winter to early summer, can provide good control of most species of scale. Certain scale problems on large plants and hosts especially sensitive to scale damage may warrant the application of a systemic insecticide. If plants perform poorly or are repeatedly damaged by pests, the best course of action may be to replace the plant with a pest-resistant species or cultivar that is better adapted to the site conditions. Monitoring Periodically check to ensure that plants have a good growing environment and are receiving appropriate cultural care. Inspect plants to determine whether female scales, nymphs, honeydew, sooty mold, or ants and other pests are present. Before applying insecticide, examine a portion of the scales to determine whether they are dead or parasitized as described below; for example, they fail to exude fluid when squished. If a large proportion of scales are dead or parasitized by natural enemies, consider delaying a treatment decision and monitor the population again later before deciding whether to apply pesticide. Tape traps for crawlers and honeydew monitoring are useful in certain situations for determining the need and best timing for pesticide application. Inspect trunks for ants periodically during the growing season. If the descending ants have swollen, almost translucent abdomens, they may be feeding on honeydew produced by scales or other insects. Trace back trail-making ants to locate colonies of the honeydew-producing insects. There are no quantitative action guidelines for deciding whether pesticide application for scales is warranted. Monitor and record scale densities and use the density that caused damage (dieback or unacceptable honeydew) as your preliminary control action threshold. As you gain experience, refine this threshold over time for your local situation. Tape Traps Transparent double-sided sticky tape can be used to effectively time a foliar insecticide application. During the spring before crawlers begin to emerge, tightly encircle each of several scale-infested twigs or branches with transparent tape that is sticky on both sides, available at fabric or craft stores. Double over the loose end of the tape several times to make it easier to remove. Place a tag or flagging near each tape so you can readily find it. Change the tapes at weekly intervals. After removing the old tape, wrap the twig at the same location with fresh tape. Preserve the old sticky tapes by sandwiching them between a sheet of white paper and clear plastic. Label the tapes with the date, location, and host plant from which they were collected. Scale crawlers get stuck on the tape and appear as yellow or orange specks. Examine the tape with a hand lens to distinguish the crawlers (which are round or oblong and have very short appendages) from pollen and dust. Use a hand lens to examine the crawlers beneath mature female scales on bark or foliage to be certain of crawler appearance. Other tiny creatures, including mites, may also be caught in the tape. Visually compare the tapes collected on each sample date. If a spring or summer foliar insecticide application is planned, unless another time is recommended for that species, spray after crawler production (abundance in traps) has peaked and definitely begun to decline, which is soon after most crawlers have settled. Honeydew Monitoring Honeydew drippings from plants can be efficiently monitored using water-sensitive paper, which is commonly used for monitoring insecticide droplets and calibrating sprayers. Products include bright yellow cards that produce distinct blue dots upon contact with honeydew or water. Regularly monitoring honeydew beneath plants, such as the number of drops during four hours on the same time of day once a week, can help to develop thresholds and evaluate effectiveness of the treatment. Honeydew monitoring is useful where there is a low tolerance for dripping honeydew, when managing many trees, such as along city streets or in parks, and on tall trees where the honeydew-producing insects may be located too high to easily observe. For more information on monitoring honeydew, see the book Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs. Cultural Control Provide plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation, so they are more resistant to scale damage. You can prune off heavily infested twigs and branches, if they are limited to a few parts of small plants. In areas with hot summers, pruning to open up canopies can reduce populations of black scale, citricola scale, cottony cushion scale, and possibly other scales by increasing scale mortality from exposure to heat and parasites. Consider replacing problem-prone plants. Biological Control Scales are preyed upon by small parasitic wasps and many predators, including certain beetles, bugs, lacewings, and mites. Predatory lady beetle (ladybug) species of Chilocorus, Hyperaspis, and Rhyzobius, can easily be overlooked because the adults of many species are tiny or colored and shaped like scales, and their larvae may feed hidden beneath scales. Hyperaspis species are tiny, shiny, black lady beetles with several red, orange, or yellow spots on the back. Rhyzobius lophanthae has a reddish head and underside and a grayish back densely covered with tiny hairs. The twicestabbed lady beetle, Chilocorus orbus, is shiny black with two red spots on its back. Often the most important natural enemies of scales are parasitic wasps, including species of Aphytis, Coccophagus, Encarsia, and Metaphycus . The female wasp lays one or several eggs in or on each scale, where the tiny maggotlike wasp larvae feed. Parasitized scales may become puffy or darken in comparison with unparasitized scales. Sometimes the immature parasites are visible through the scale surface. After completing the larval stage and pupating, the emerging adult of internal parasites typically leaves a round exit hole in the scale it killed. With external parasites that feed outside the scale body, but under the cover of armored scales, their maggotlike larvae may be observed by prying off the scale cover. Natural enemies are commercially available for release against California red scale and perhaps certain other scales. However, conserving resident natural enemies is a more efficient and longer lasting strategy than buying and releasing beneficials in gardens and landscapes. Ant control, habitat manipulation, and pesticide management are the key natural enemy conservation strategies. If ants are abundant, selectively control them. Grow a variety of flowering plants to help attract and support natural enemies. Adults of predatory bugs, lacewings, lady beetles, and parasitic wasps live longer, lay more eggs, and kill more scales when they have plant nectar or pollen and insect honeydew to feed on. Avoid creating dust because it interferes with natural enemies. For example, rinse small plants when foliage becomes dusty. Depending on the scale species and the extent to which biological control has been disrupted, it will take several months of conservation efforts (such as controlling ants and dust and avoiding application of persistent insecticides) or until the next season or longer before scale populations are reduced by biological control. If current levels of scales are intolerable, spray insecticidal oils to reduce scale populations while conserving natural enemies. Ant Control Because ants attack and feed on scale parasites and predators, control ants if they are tending scales . To deny ants access to plant canopies, prune branches or weeds that provide a bridge between buildings or the ground and apply a sticky material (Tanglefoot) to trunks. Wrap the trunk with a collar of fabric tree wrap, heavy paper, or masking tape to avoid injury to bark; wedge pliable wrap snugly into cracks and crevices; and coat the wrap with the sticky material . A barrier band about 2 to 6 inches wide should be adequate in most situations. Inspect wraps at least several times a year for damage to bark and remove and relocate any wrap at least once a year to minimize bark injury. Periodically stir sticky material with a stick to prevent ants from crossing on collected debris. Avoid applying sticky material to horizontal surfaces where birds may roost. Place enclosed pesticide baits (insecticide mixed with an attractant) near nests or on ant trails beneath plants. Effective, slow-acting bait insecticides work over a period of days so that before ants die they will spread the toxicant among many other ants during food sharing. Boric acid, fipronil, and hydramethylnon are examples of insecticides used in ant baits. Although baits require users to be patient, they can be much more effective than sprays. Sprays only kill foraging workers, while ant baits are carried back to the nests where reproductive queens and the entire colony underground can be killed. See Pest Notes: Ants for more information. Chemical Control Before applying insecticide, make sure plants are receiving appropriate cultural care and take steps to conserve natural enemies. Check a portion of the scales to be certain they are alive and to evaluate the extent of parasitism as described above. To know how and when to effectively make an application, learn more about the available insecticides and the biology of your pest species. Completely read and follow the product label instructions for the safe and effective use of the insecticide. Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water, poisoning natural enemies and pollinators, and causing secondary pest outbreaks. Nonresidual, Contact Insecticides Where plants can be sprayed, complete spray coverage of infested plant parts with horticultural oil at the proper time provides good control of most scales. Horticultural oils (e.g., Bonide Horticultural Oil and Monterey Horticultural Oil) are specially refined petroleum products, often called narrow-range, superior, or supreme oils. Other nonpersistent, contact sprays for garden and landscape plants include insecticidal soap (Safer Brand Insect Killing Soap Concentrate II), neem oil (Bayer Advanced Natria Neem Oil Concentrate, Green Light Neem, Garden Safe Brand Neem), canola oil (Bayer Advanced Natria Multi-Insect Control), and other botanical (plant-derived) oils. These insecticides have low toxicity to people and pets and relatively little adverse impact on the populations of pollinators and natural enemies and the benefits they provide. To obtain adequate control, thoroughly wet the infested plant parts with spray, typically shoot terminals and the underside of leaves. More than one application per growing season may be needed, especially if the targeted pest has more than one generation a year. Thorough spray coverage is especially critical when treating armored scales and oak pit scales as these scales are generally less susceptible to pesticides than soft scales. Dormant Season To control most scales overwintering on deciduous woody plants, thoroughly spray the bark of terminal shoots with oil during winter. For oak pit scales, sycamore scale, and other harder to control species, spray during the plant’s delayed-dormant period, which is after the buds swell but before buds open. Do not spray oystershell or olive scales during the dormant season because susceptible stages of these species are not present during winter. Foliage Spray Horticultural oil is effective in spring or summer on deciduous plants when sprayed soon after most crawlers have emerged and most scales are in the young nymph stage. Late spring and summer are also the times to spray avocado, citrus, and many other broadleaf evergreens. Thoroughly cover with spray the plant parts where scales occur, typically on twig terminals and the underside of leaves. Precautions on Using Oils Follow product labels, which may say to not spray certain plant species or mix oil with certain other products. For example, oil will remove the desirable bluish tinge from blue spruce foliage, although the plant’s health is not impaired. Do not mix oil with chlorothalonil, sulfur, and certain other fungicides; and do not apply oil within 3 weeks of an application of sulfur-containing compounds, such as wettable sulfur. Do not apply oil or other insecticides when it is foggy, freezing (under 32°F), hot (over 90°F), when relative humidity is above 90%, or if rain is expected in the next 24 hours. Especially at locations with hot weather, be sure plants are well irrigated before spraying foliage. Systemic Insecticides Systemic insecticides are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., trunks or roots) and moved (translocated) to leaves and other plant parts. In comparison with systemics that are sprayed onto foliage, products labeled for soil drench or injection, or for trunk injection or spray minimize environmental contamination and may be more effective than contact insecticides. Trunk application of an effective systemic insecticide can provide relatively rapid control. There is a longer time delay between soil application and insecticide action. Some uses require hiring a professional pesticide applicator. Certain home-use products can easily be drenched into soil around the tree trunk using the mix-and-pour method. Systemic insecticides for use on landscape plants include neonicotinoids (acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam) and the organophosphate acephate (Lilly Miller Ready-to-Use Systemic, Orthene). Properly applied, one application of an effective product may provide season-long control. However, neonicotinoids vary in effectiveness for scale control. For example, acetamiprid (Ortho Flower, Fruit & Vegetable Insect Killer) controls soft scales but is not very effective on armored scales and can only be applied by spraying foliage. Imidacloprid controls European elm scale and most soft scales but does not control cottony cushion scale and most armored scales. Dinotefuran (Green Light Tree and Shrub Insect Control with Safari 2G, Safari) controls most types of scales. Some of these products are for licensed professional applicators only. Some systemic insecticides can cause spider mite outbreaks. Foliage sprays of systemics can be toxic to beneficial insects that contact spray or treated leaves. Systemics can translocate into flowers and have adverse effects on natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. Do not apply systemic insecticides to plants during flowering or shortly before flowering; wait until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering unless the product’s label directions say otherwise. With foliage spraying and soil application, when possible, wait until nearby plants also have completed flowering as spray can drift onto nearby plants or their roots may take up some of the soil-applied insecticide. When applying systemic insecticide, use soil application or a trunk spray whenever possible . With trunk injection and implantation it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. Trunk injection and implantation also injure woody plants and can spread plant pathogens on contaminated tools. When injecting or implanting into multiple plants, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate bark and disinfect tools with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach) before moving to work on each new plant. At least one to two minutes of disinfectant contact time between contaminated uses is generally required. Consider rotating work among several tools and using a freshly disinfected tool while the most recently used tools are being soaked in disinfectant. Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject into roots or trunks more than once a year. Residual, Foliar Sprays Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides with residues that can persist for weeks are not recommended for scale control in landscapes and gardens. Pesticides to avoid include carbamates (carbaryl or Sevin), nonsystemic organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fluvalinate, permethrin). These are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause outbreaks of spider mites or other pests. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms.\tTABLE 1.

    "contentQuickTips": "Pests in Gardens and Landscapes: Quick Tips Scales Published 4/17 Read more on this topic Scale insects suck plant juices and are pests of many trees and shrubs. Infestations can cause yellowing or premature dropping of leaves, sticky honeydew, and blackish sooty mold. Plant parts can distort or die back, depending on the species and abundance of scales. Management includes proper plant care, conserving natural enemies, and applying low-toxicity insecticides when needed. Most plants tolerate low to moderate numbers of scales. Damage resembles that of aphids and whiteflies. Abundant sticky honeydew excreted by soft scales and certain other species. Black sooty mold growing on the honeydew. Discolored, distorted, or dying leaves, twigs, or branches, especially with armored scales. Recognize scales: Circular, elongate, or oval discolorations or raised areas on bark, leaves, or fruit. Immobile or slow-moving bodies or coverings 1/25 to 1/4 inch long that lack an obvious head or appendages and don’t resemble most other insects. Distinguish the two most common types of scales—soft and armored. Armored scales are tiny and flat, have covers that usually can be removed from the body, and don’t secrete sticky honeydew. Common species include San José scale and California red scale. Soft scales are larger, excrete honeydew, and are more rounded and convex with covers that don’t lift off. Common species include black scale, lecanium scale, and brown soft scale. Learn the species or family name of your scale so you can identify effective controls. To reduce problems, use an integrated program. Provide plants with proper cultural care, especially irrigation. Encourage scale natural enemies. Look for predators such as lady beetles or lacewings and parasite emergence holes in scale covers. Use sticky barriers or insecticide baits to selectively control scale-tending ants. Consider replacing problem-prone plants. Most scales are highly specific to certain plants. What about insecticides? Don’t treat unless you have an intolerable or damaging problem. Avoid insecticides that injure natural enemies. For fruit trees and smaller plants, make a well-timed and thorough spray using horticultural oil during the dormant season or when scale crawlers are active in the growing season. For intolerable soft scale problems, especially on large trees, consider soil-applied imidacloprid. This material is not effective against some scales, including armored scales, and may cause outbreaks of cottony cushion scale. ",

    "name": "Redhumped Caterpillar",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The redhumped caterpillar, Schizura concinna (Notodontidae), is found throughout much of the United States. In California, high populations are usually limited to the Central Valley. This pest most commonly chews leaves of liquidambar (sweet gum), plum, and walnut. It also feeds on almond, apple, apricot, birch, cherry, cottonwood, pear, prune, redbud, willow, and other deciduous trees and shrubs.",
    "life_cycle": "The redhumped caterpillar, Schizura concinna (Notodontidae), is found throughout much of the United States.

It also feeds on almond, apple, apricot, birch, cherry, cottonwood, pear, prune, redbud, willow, and other deciduous trees and shrubs.",
    "damagePestNote": "Young caterpillars commonly feed side-by-side in groups, chewing on the lower leaf surface. As the larvae grow, they tend to disperse and feed in smaller groups or individually. Skeletonized leaves are a common result, as the older caterpillars chew all the way through and consume leaves, leaving only the larger, tough veins. Unlike certain other caterpillars that may feed on the same hosts, redhumped caterpillars do not tie leaves with webbing or leave silk strands on foliage; the exception is when silk-covered pupae occur on leaves. When their abundance is low, larvae eat leaves on only a few branch terminals. Occasionally, heavy infestations develop and defoliate entire trees during the summer. Usually only scattered individual and young trees are severely defoliated. If severely defoliated, trees that are otherwise healthy usually recover. Redhumped caterpillars do not feed on fruit or nuts, but these may become sunburned and drop prematurely if defoliation is severe. Yield quantity may be reduced the season after fruit or nut trees are defoliated.",
    "managementPestNote": "Biological control and spot-pruning of infested shoots are sufficient to manage this pest in most situations. Insecticide application can be warranted if caterpillars are abundant and their feeding damage is intolerable, especially when trees are small, already stressed, or unhealthy from other causes. Monitoring On hosts where this insect has been a problem, look for redhumped caterpillars in April and May. This is when the first-generation caterpillars may be present. Inspect the underside of terminal leaves for egg masses and groups of small caterpillars at least once a week. From a distance, look for green shoots with ragged (chewed) or few leaves, or leaves that turn brown, which may indicate the presence of redhumped caterpillars. Leaves can turn brown from many other causes, so inspect the underside of leaves for the insects themselves and their chewing damage. If you find eggs or larvae of the first generation, prune out and destroy the infested shoots. Monitor again in late June and July for second-generation eggs and caterpillars. If you find these, look for evidence of parasitism as described below. If caterpillar parasitism is abundant, no further control action is needed. If parasitization is low, prune out and destroy infestations if they are limited, or consider applying an insecticide if caterpillars are abundant. Biological Control Parasitic wasps (parasitoids) are important natural enemies of the redhumped caterpillar and often appear to prevent this pest from becoming abundant. Female wasps of several species lay eggs in caterpillars, which hatch into larvae that feed inside the host. Cotesia\t(Apanteles)\tschizurae (Braconidae) feeds as multiple larvae inside each caterpillar; they emerge and pupate in white, silken cocoons in a group near the caterpillar they killed. Hyposoter fugitivus larvae feed singly and pupate inside the skin of the caterpillar, which becomes swollen and mottled gray with black. Because these parasites do not change their host appearance until shortly before the caterpillar is killed, when obviously parasitized caterpillars are observed, other nearby caterpillars may also contain parasites too immature to have affected caterpillar appearance. When a caterpillar appears lethargic or not actively feeding, especially when others nearby appear parasitized, grasping the caterpillar at each end and pulling it apart may expose one or more pale, maggotlike, parasite larvae inside. Trichogramma spp. wasps feed as larvae inside moth eggs, causing the normally pale-colored eggs to darken. When a Trichogramma adult emerges, the egg has a smooth-edged, roundish hole instead of the irregular, ragged hole chewed when a caterpillar emerged.\tPredators of caterpillar eggs and young larvae include bigeyed bugs, damsel bugs, green lacewings, and spiders. Find out more about the parasites and predators mentioned here on UC IPM’s Natural Enemies Gallery webpage. Conserve parasites and predators by avoiding the use of long-residual (long-lasting), broad-spectrum insecticides such as carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids. Plant flowering species as insectary plants near commonly infested trees, because parasites of redhumped caterpillar live longer, lay more eggs, and can parasitize and kill more caterpillars when the adult parasites are provided with flower nectar, as discussed by Pinnock and others (see References).\tInsectary Plants\nInsectary plants are those grown to attract, feed, and shelter insect parasites (parasitoids) and predators to enhance biological control.\tFor recommended annual insectary plants, see Flower Flies (Syrphidae) and Other Biological Control Agents for Aphids in Vegetable Crops. For perennial insectary plant species and their management, consult Establishing Hedgerows on Farms in California .\tAvoid insectary-plant species that host arthropod pests or plant pathogens that can move to damage nearby crops or ornamentals. Consult the UC IPM publications on the plants you are considering for insectaries. Compare their pest species to those listed for your crops or other desirable plants grown:\nCommercial crops — UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines :\tGardens and landscapes —UC IPM guide for\tFlowers\tFruit trees, nuts, berries, and grapevines\tTrees and shrubs\tVegetables and melons\nCultural Control Clip off shoots that contain caterpillars while the insects are young and feeding in groups. At this stage, you'll need to prune off only the infested shoot terminals to destroy a large group of caterpillars. Crush the caterpillars, or dispose of them in a plastic bag in the trash. Provide trees and shrubs with a good growing environment and proper cultural care to encourage their healthy regrowth and increase plants' tolerance to redhumped caterpillar chewing and damage by certain other pests. See the management recommendations at ipm.ucanr.edu for more information. Chemical Control If applying insecticides, select active ingredients that are the least toxic to the caterpillar's natural enemies and other nontarget organisms. These insecticides include Bacillus thuringiensis and spinosad, which can be sprayed on foliage alone, in combination, or mixed with horticultural oil (petroleum or narrow-range oil, e.g., All Seasons Horticultural & Dormant Spray Oil). Because redhumped caterpillar infestations tend to be very localized, spot treatment (e.g., spraying only the outer shoots on infested hosts) is usually sufficient. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is a group of naturally occurring bacteria that kill certain insects. To be effective, Bt must be eaten by the caterpillars, and it is most effective on younger caterpillars. Caterpillars stop eating within one day after feeding on a leaf sprayed with Bt; then they darken and die within a couple of days. Thoroughly spray the underside of infested leaves with Bt when caterpillars and their chewing first appear. A second application 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended, because Bt degrades quickly and not all the moth eggs hatch at the same time. Bt has little or no toxicity to humans, bees, and most other animals, including the natural enemies of redhumped caterpillars. Bts are produced commercially by fermentation and sold for pest control. The caterpillar-killing Bt subspecies aizawai and Bt subspecies kurstaki are available in a variety of products, including Garden Safe Brand Bt Worm & Caterpillar Killer, Monterey B.t., and Thuricide Bacillus thuringiensis . Agree WG Biological Insecticide, Jackpot WP, and certain other products containing Bt subspecies aizawai are available only to professional applicators. If caterpillar-infested trees are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. Request they apply caterpillar-selective Bt, or spinosad as discussed below if the plants to be sprayed are not blossoming. The active ingredient spinosad is a mixture of spinosyns, which are fermentation products from the bacterium Saccharopolyspora spinosa. Spinosad quickly kills insects that contact or eat it, including most caterpillars, flies, thrips, and certain species of beetles and wasps. It can kill a larger percentage of the caterpillars than Bt, especially when spraying older caterpillars. Spinosad (e.g., Captain Jack's Deadbug Brew, Monterey Garden Insect Spray, Ortho Insect Killer Tree and Shrub Concentrate) remains effective for about 1 week after application. Adding horticultural oil to the spray mix and using water with a pH of 6 to 8 may increase the persistence of spinosad. Spinosad has relatively low toxicity to people but can be toxic to pollinators and natural enemies, including parasites of caterpillars. Applying Bt instead of spinosad where natural enemies are active may provide better long-term control by conserving natural enemies. It is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, so do not apply or allow it to drift to plants that are flowering. To minimize its adverse effects on honey bees, apply spinosad in the late evening if permitted by the label and regulations. Insecticides to Avoid. Avoid foliar sprays of carbamate insecticides (carbaryl), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), or pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin). These materials are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause spider mite outbreaks. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water, and are adversely affecting nontarget aquatic organisms.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Plumeria, a plant native to the American tropics and also known as frangipani or the Lei flower, has become an increasingly popular cultivated plant in California homes and gardens. Sold in many nurseries and garden centers, it can be grown outdoors during mild growing seasons but must be moved indoors when temperatures are cold in the winter. One of the major pests associated with plumeria is the sixspotted spider mite, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus. Sixspotted mite is also occasionally a pest on avocado, citrus, and other tropical plants. Management can be achieved with cultural practices and application of insecticidal soaps or oils. SYMPTOMS Suspect the possible presence of sixspotted web-spinning spider mites if early season plumeria growth shows deformed leaves, abnormally forming bloom clusters, blistered tissue, necrotic spots on leaves, leaf drop, or shoot tip dieback. Other symptoms suggesting a mite problem are fully developed leaves with a yellow stripe down the midrib or bronzing on the upper leaf surface, webbing between the midrib and upper leaf surface, or webbing between the base of the leaf petiole and the plant stem. Other Web-spinning Mites The twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae, and the Pacific spider mite, Tetranychus pacificus, both damage plumeria by deforming and bronzing leaf tissue. No direct necrosis or blistering of plumeria tissue has been noted as a result of these mites. Leaves on plants hosting more than one species of web-spinning mite will turn entirely yellow in color and then drop. The management practices discussed below will control these mites as well.",

Leaves on plants hosting more than one species of web-spinning mite will turn entirely yellow in color and then drop. The management practices discussed below will control these mites as well.",
    "damagePestNote": "The mite feeds on plant juices and causes leaf yellowing as well as blistering and deformation of tissue. These symptoms have been noted in other plant species as well. On avocado leaf discoloration is brown to purple. Early season feeding may be first noted on the underside of leaves along the midrib, at the base of the leaf petiole, or along the midrib of newly forming leaves. Mite feeding damages developing bloom clusters, causes premature leaf-drop, and decreases plant vigor. If these mites attack during first signs of new growth, they may cause abscission (separation) of developing shoot tips from the rest of the plant. Later generations move to the upper surface of expanded leaves, causing a slight blistering near the midrib, and creating webs that bridge between the midrib and leaf surface. Webs are initially close to the tissue and hard to observe, but if populations are high enough, the mites will spin webs between the stem and petioles. Later in the season, if populations are abundant, mites will collect at leaf tips and may be found suspended on silk threads from the edges of the uppermost leaves. Mite feeding prevents the leaf petiole glands from producing secretions and affected leaf tissues may exude latex. While the mite prefers tender leaf growth, it will also attack tender stem tissue, even after shoot tips have abscised.",
    "managementPestNote": "If mites are controlled early in the season, plumeria will produce new leaves and recover during the course of the season. As summer progresses, regularly observe plants to detect the presence of webbing along the midrib on the upper leaf surface and particularly toward the leaf petiole. A good hand lens or magnifier (20X) will be required to see the mites and their eggs. Treat if sixspotted mites are present—leaving any population results in leaf and shoot tip abscission eliminating bloom production. If webbing and mites are present in the fall, treat plants prior to moving them indoors for the winter to reduce the risk of continued damage. Spray Treatments A light horticultural oil spray (1% solution) can effectively control mites if care is taken to cover all plant surfaces. Insecticidal soaps can be utilized as an alternative to oil but it’s more likely that repeat applications may be necessary. When using soaps or oils, plants should be well-watered to avoid stress, and caution must be taken not to expose the plants to excessive heat and/or direct sunlight prior to or after treatment. Biological Control Predatory mites may reduce populations naturally; however the threshold for sixspotted mite on plumeria is very low. Metaseiulus occidentalis, the western predatory mite, will feed on all pest mite life stages. Other predatory phytoseiid mites include Amblyseius (= Typhlodromalus) limonicus and Galendromus helveolus. The shiny pear-shaped predator Euseius hibisci is important in part because it can maintain and increase its populations on pollen when pest mites are scarce. Typhlodromus rickeri also preys on sixspotted mite in coastal Southern California. The spider mite destroyer lady beetle (Stethorus picipes), lacewings, and sixspotted thrips (Scolothrips sexmaculatus) are other natural enemies. Cultural Control Close monitoring of the plants during late fall, winter, and early spring is important to ensure timely treatment of the plants before severe damage occurs. Double-sided sticky tape wrapped around the plant stem may help prevent overwintering mites from crawling up the stem. Since plumeria is normally a container plant in most of California, dusty conditions that can aggravate mites are not usually an issue. Avoiding water stress is always an important practice to minimize mites and this is true for plants in containers as well.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Mites are common pests in landscapes and gardens that feed on many fruit trees, vines, berries, vegetables, and ornamental plants. Although related to insects, mites aren’t insects but members of the arachnid class along with spiders and ticks. Spider mites (Figure 1), also called webspinning mites, are the most common mite pests and among the most ubiquitous of all pests in the garden and on the farm. Webspinning spider mites include the Pacific spider mite, twospotted spider mite, strawberry spider mite, and several other species. Most common ones are closely related species in the Tetranychus genus and can’t be reliably distinguished in the field. However, there is little need to do so, since their damage, biology, and management are virtually the same. To the naked eye, spider mites look like tiny, moving dots; however, you can see them easily with a 10X hand lens. Adult females, the largest forms, are less than 1/20 inch long. Spider mites live in colonies, mostly on the undersurfaces of leaves; a single colony may contain hundreds of individuals (Figure 2). The names “spider mite” and “webspinning mite” come from the silk webbing most species produce on infested leaves (Figure 3). The presence of webbing is an easy way to distinguish them from all other types of mites and small insects such as aphids and thrips, which can also infest leaf undersides. Adult mites have eight legs and an oval body with two red eyespots near the head end. Females usually have a large, dark blotch on each side of the body and numerous bristles covering the legs and body. Immatures resemble adults (except they are much smaller), and the newly hatched larvae have only six legs. The other immature stages have eight legs. Eggs are spherical and translucent, like tiny droplets, becoming cream colored before hatching (Figure 4).",
    "life_cycle": "In some parts of California, spider mites may feed and reproduce all year on plants that retain their green leaves throughout the winter. In colder areas and on deciduous trees that drop their leaves, webspinning mites overwinter as red or orange mated females under rough bark scales and in ground litter and trash. They begin feeding and laying eggs when warm weather returns in spring. Spider mites reproduce rapidly in hot weather and commonly become numerous in June through September. If the temperature and food supplies are favorable, a generation can be completed in less than a week (Figure 5). Spider mites prefer hot, dusty conditions and usually are first found on trees or plants adjacent to dusty roadways or at margins of gardens. Plants under water stress also are highly susceptible. As foliage quality declines on heavily infested plants, female mites catch wind currents and disperse to other plants. High mite populations may undergo a rapid decline in late summer when predators overtake them, host plant conditions become unfavorable, and the weather turns cooler as well as following rain.",
    "damagePestNote": "Mites cause damage by sucking cell contents from leaves. A small number of mites usually isn’t reason for concern, but very high populations—levels high enough to show visible damage to leaves—can damage plants, especially herbaceous ones. At first, the damage shows up as a stippling of light dots on the leaves; sometimes the leaves take on a bronze color. As feeding continues, the leaves turn yellowish or reddish and drop off. Often, large amounts of webbing cover leaves, twigs, and fruit. Damage is usually worse when compounded by water stress. Loss of leaves won’t cause yield losses in fruit trees during the year of infestation unless it occurs in spring or very early summer, but it may impact next year’s crop. On annual vegetable crops—such as squash, melons, and watermelons—loss of leaves can have a significant impact on yield and lead to sunburning. On crops such as sugar peas and beans, where pods are attacked, spider mites can cause direct damage. On ornamentals, mites are primarily an aesthetic concern, but they can kill plants if populations become very high on annual plants. Spider mites are also important pests of field-grown roses.",
    "managementPestNote": "Spider mites have many natural enemies that often limit populations. Adequate irrigation is important, because water-stressed plants are most likely to be damaged. Broad-spectrum insecticide treatments for other pests frequently cause mite outbreaks, so avoid these pesticides when possible. Sprays of water, insecticidal oils, or soaps can be used for management. Always monitor mite levels before treatment. Monitoring Mites are tiny and difficult to detect. You’ll usually notice plant damage such as stippled or yellow leaves before you spot the mites themselves (Figure 6). Check the undersides of leaves for mites, their eggs, and webbing; you’ll need a hand lens to identify them. To observe mites more closely, shake a few off the leaf surface onto a white sheet of paper. Once disturbed, they will move around rapidly. Be sure mites are present before you treat. Sometimes the mites will be gone by the time you notice the damage; plants will often recover after mites have left. Biological Control Spider mites have many natural enemies, which limit their numbers in many landscapes and gardens, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Some of the most important are the predatory mites, including the western predatory mite (Figure 7), Galendromus (formerly Metaseiulus) occidentalis, and Phytoseiulus mite species. Predatory mites are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active; they also are more teardrop-shaped than spider mites. Various other insects are also important predators—sixspotted thrips (Scolothrips sexmaculatus) (Figure 8), the larvae and adults of the spider mite destroyer lady beetle (Stethorus picipes), the larvae of certain flies including the cecidomyid Feltiella acarivora (Figure 9), and various general predators such as minute pirate bugs, bigeyed bugs, and lace­wing larvae. Western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, can be an important predator on spider mite eggs and larvae, but this species will also inflict severe damage to plants if mites aren’t present on which to feed. The purchase and release of predatory mites can be useful in establishing populations in large plantings or orchards, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators, such as avoiding dusty conditions and insecticide sprays. The major predator mites commercially available for release are the western predatory mite and Phytoseiulus. The western predatory mite is more effective under hot, dry conditions. These predators don’t feed on foliage or become pests; thus if pest mites aren’t available when predatory mites are released, the predators starve or migrate elsewhere. If you wish to establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray or selective miticide to bring pest mites to a lower level and then release predatory mites. A good guideline is that one predator is needed for every 10 spider mites to provide control. More than one application of predatory mites may be required if you want to reduce pest populations rapidly. Concentrate releases in hot spots where spider mite numbers are highest. Once established on perennials, predatory mites may reproduce and provide biological control indefinitely without further augmentation unless nonselective insecticides are applied that kill the predators. Cultural Control Cultural practices can have a significant impact on spider mites. Dusty conditions often lead to mite outbreaks. Apply water to pathways and other dusty areas at regular intervals. Water-stressed trees and plants are less tolerant of spider mite damage. Be sure to provide adequate irrigation. Mid­season washing of trees and vines with water to remove dust may help prevent serious late-season mite infestations. In gardens and on small fruit trees, regular, forceful spraying of plants with water often will reduce spider mite numbers adequately. Be sure to get good coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves. If more control is required, use an insecticidal soap or oil in your spray, but test the product on one or two plants to be sure it isn’t damaging to them. (See Chemical Control below.) Chemical Control Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying insecticides. Such outbreaks are commonly a result of the insecticide killing off the mites’ natural enemies but also occur when certain insecticides stimulate mite reproduction. For example, spider mites exposed to carbaryl (Sevin) in the laboratory have been shown to reproduce faster than untreated populations. Carbaryl, some organophosphates, and some pyrethroids apparently also favor spider mites by increasing the level of nitrogen in leaves. Insecticides applied during hot weather usually appear to have the greatest effect, causing dramatic spider mite outbreaks within a few days. If a treatment for mites is necessary, use selective materials, preferably insecticidal soap or insecticidal oil. Both petroleum-based horticultural oils and plant-based oils such as neem, canola, or cottonseed oils are acceptable. There are also a number of plant extracts formulated as acaricides (a pesticide that kills mites) that exert an effect on spider mites. These include garlic extract, clove oil, mint oils, rosemary oil, cinnamon oil and others. Don’t use soaps or oils on water-stressed plants or when temperatures exceed 90°F. These materials may injure some plants, so check labels and/or test them out on a portion of the foliage several days before applying a full treatment. Oils and soaps must contact mites to kill them, so excellent coverage, especially on the undersides of leaves, is essential, and repeat applications may be required. Sulfur sprays can be used on some vegetables, fruit trees, and ornamentals. This product will burn cucur­bits and other plants in some cases. Don’t use sulfur unless it has been shown to be safe for that plant in your locality. Use liquid products such as sulfur and potash soap combinations (e.g., Safer Brand 3-in-1 Garden Spray) rather than sulfur dusts, which drift easily and can be breathed in. Don’t use sulfur if temperatures exceed 90°F, and don’t apply sulfur within 30 days of an oil spray. Sulfur is a skin irritant and eye and respiratory hazard, so always wear appropriate protective clothing.",

Damage is usually most severe in hot, dusty conditions and on water-stressed plants. Protect predators of spider mites. Spider mites have many predators or “natural enemies”, which prevent them from becoming plant pests, especially when undisturbed by pesticide sprays. Key predators include predatory mites, which are about the same size as plant-feeding mites but have longer legs and are more active. Other common natural enemies include thrips, lacewings, and minute pirate bugs. Keep dust down. Plant ground covers, use mulches, and irrigate regularly. Avoid using insecticides that kill natural enemies. How do I control spider mites? Water plants sufficiently to avoid drought stress, which increases mites and mite damage. Most woody plants can tolerate low to moderate mite populations, and natural enemies are often abundant. If plants are infested, apply a water spray or mist to the undersides of leaves at least once a day. If you wish to use an insecticide, a good choice is an insecticidal oil or soap (or a combination of the two) applied so you completely cover the undersides of leaves. Be sure mites are present before treating. Don’t spray when plants are water-stressed or if it is very hot. Spider mites frequently become a problem after applying persistent insecticides such as carbaryl or pyrethroids. These insecticides are not very effective against mites and often kill off natural enemies and stimulate mite reproduction. What about pesticides?

Page discoloration often occurs because of the fungi associated with their feeding damage. On paper and fabrics feeding usually begins in one area and spreads as unconnected, irregularly shaped holes.",
    "managementPestNote": "Since firebrats and silverfish are nocturnal, you usually won’t see them. To detect and monitor infestations, use cockroach sticky traps. You also can use small, glass jars covered on the outside with masking tape. The insects climb up the tape, fall into the jars, and can’t climb back up the slick sides. Place these traps or jars in corners and along edges where foraging is likely. Because these insects can travel long distances while looking for food, it can be difficult to pinpoint the infestation source. To prevent silverfish and firebrat infestations, keep basements, laundry rooms, and bathrooms—especially shower stalls—clean and dry. Household dust and debris are important sources of food, so routine cleaning will help provide effective control. In addition, periodically clean out closets, cabinets, and storage containers. Patch holes or spaces around pipes and conduits, and repair leaks and drips in plumbing. Silverfish require a lot of moisture, so using dehumidifiers in closed spaces can help discourage these pests. Ventilation from fans can reduce relative humidity to a point that is intolerable to silverfish. Because collections of magazines, papers, and books provide food and harborage, occasionally move these items around in your bookcase. Keep food in containers with tight lids, especially dry, processed items. Chemical Control Hundreds of commercially available insecticides list firebrats and silverfish on their labels. However, most of these products haven’t been adequately tested. Insecticides aren’t required to control light infestations or an occasional insect; these can be managed by reducing water sources and through physical control. Reserve chemical use for large infestations. Insecticides won’t be effective unless you also remove the moisture, food, and hiding places that allow these pests to thrive. If you have an infestation, household sprays containing synergized pyrethrin and pyrethroids such as bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, tetramethrin, and phenothrin should kill firebrats and silverfish on contact and provide some residual activity. Direct small amounts of these aerosol or liquid sprays into cracks and crevices in doors and window casings, along edges and intersections such as baseboards, in closets, bookcases, and places where pipes go through walls, and into voids and other suitable, dark hiding places. Because some sprays have oil-solution bases, don’t apply them near electric motors, gas pilot flames, or other places where they can start fires. Follow label directions. Don’t allow these materials to get into sinks, drains, water, or food. A variety of commercial baits and dusts also are available. However, baits aren’t very successful in treating silverfish and firebrats, because they tend not to feed on them. Similarly, several of the inorganic dusts containing boric acid are ineffective against firebrats. However, some inorganic dust products containing synergized pyrethrin (including certain boric acid or silica gel products) are very effective against firebrats and silverfish if you apply the product directly on pests. Labels limit use of some inorganic dust products in open areas. Be sure to check the label. Apply dusts with a bulb duster, powder blower, or a plastic squeeze bottle to leave a fine layer of the material in the area you are treating. If the layer is too thick, the surface will be slippery. Apply into areas as described above for sprays, paying special attention to cracks, crevices, and wall voids that serve as congregation sites. Inorganic dusts such as silica gel and pyrethrin (e.g. Drione) and diatomaceous earth (e.g. Perma-Guard) remain effective indefinitely in dry locations. If dust deposits get wet and then dry, they will cake, making them difficult for insects to pick up. You might need to periodically re-treat moist areas. Follow label directions. Foggers aren’t recommended to treat silverfish and firebrat infestations. A properly and thoroughly applied insecticide will show results in a few weeks. If control doesn’t occur in 2 or 3 weeks, silverfish or firebrats probably are coming from untreated areas and secluded harborages. Seek out these areas for treatment, and eliminate water sources. It is almost impossible to control large populations of silverfish and firebrats unless you have removed dripping water and moist surfaces.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta) infests most of 11 southern states and Puerto Rico and officially arrived in California in 1998, where it was found infesting numerous residential and commercial areas in Orange, Los Angeles, Riverside, San Bernardino, and to a lesser extent, San Diego counties. The initial spread of these ants resulted from the movement of infested soil and container plants to uninfested areas. The ant was also found in almond groves in the Central Valley, apparently brought in with honey bee hives from Texas. Once established, the ant spread rapidly by flight of the reproductives.",

    "damagePestNote": "The red imported fire ant's sting is a serious concern to people and their pets. Venom injected into the skin causes a burning sensation (hence the name fire ant). Both southern fire ants and red imported fire ants become very agitated when their nests are disturbed, but red imported fire ants are much more aggressive and can quickly climb onto the object or person causing the disturbance and begin stinging. A single red imported fire ant can bite and sting its victim repeatedly. Symptoms start as a burning and itching sensation followed by the formation of a white pustule, which takes several weeks to disappear. The pustules can become infected if not kept clean and may leave permanent scarring. A small percentage of the human population is allergic to these stings. If a person experiences chest pains, nausea, dizziness, or shock, he or she should seek emergency medical assistance immediately after a stinging incident. Avoid medical emergencies by teaching children and visitors about fire ants. Fire ants feed on almost any plant or animal material, including other insects, ticks, ground-nesting animals, young trees, seedlings, plant buds, developing fruits, and seeds. In addition to stings, the red imported fire ant causes problems by building its nests around trees, yard plants, pipes, and in the walls of structures. Colony-building can damage plants, lawns, and outdoor electrical fixtures.",
    "managementPestNote": "Because fire ants can sting en masse, most people will want to keep them off their property. This contrasts with other common ant species, such as the Argentine ant, where the primary goal is to keep them out of homes. For management of household ants, see Pest Notes: Ants. The red imported fire ant is a quarantined pest in California. If you suspect that the ant is on your property, you can call a statewide toll-free number staffed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) (1-888-4FIREANT or 1-888-434-7326) to help get the pest identified by someone in your area. There is also an informative fire ant website. If you are in an area where the fire ant has not been previously established, contact CDFA or the local Agricultural Commissioner for help and do not attempt your own control program. In Southern California's Orange County and in the Coachella Valley, the Vector Control Districts have active fire ant control programs and will assist residents with treatment. In Los Angeles County, the county Agricultural Commissioner may provide treatment in some areas. In other areas and in Riverside County, residents may be responsible for their own treatment. Hiring a licensed pest control operator is strongly recommended because licensed professionals have access to the most effective management products and experience in controlling this pest. Baits For professionals and residents carrying out their own management programs, fire ant baits are recommended because they are inexpensive, highly effective, and safe for the environment. Using bait allows the foraging ants to carry the poison back to the nest and the rest of the colony. Spraying insecticide on foraging ants will not control a colony and spraying a nest may cause the colony to disperse, which could make control more difficult. Most fire ant baits consist of a yellow matrix of de-gelled corn grits that are coated with soybean oil containing the toxicant. Baits should be put out when ants are seen walking on the ground (temperatures from 70° to 90°F are best). You can check if fire ants are active by putting out a piece of greasy food (potato chip or Spam) and checking it in about 30 minutes. In hotter weather baits are best applied in the evening. The ants will then forage overnight on the bait. Baits lose their effectiveness quickly with extreme heat, water, and sunlight. Fresh bait from an unopened container works best; an opened package may remain fresh for only a couple of weeks. Furthermore, the ground should be dry to avoid further deterioration of the baits. On watered turf, in most cases a couple of hours without irrigation should be sufficient. Most fire ant baits are broadcast at 1.5 lbs per acre (about 20 bait particles per square foot) and are unlikely to pose a threat to people or animals at these rates. Labels should be carefully followed with regard to where and when these baits should be applied and special care taken to avoid application on hard surfaces or other areas where baits can be washed into storm drains. For long-term control, bait containing an insect growth regulator (IGR), such as Distance, is recommended. However, IGRs are slow-acting, requiring 4 to 6 weeks for maximum efficacy. If quicker results are desired, a corn-grit bait containing hydramethylnon, such as Amdro Pro, can be used. It will give good results within one week or less. Table 1 lists some of the common bait products available for controlling ants. To ensure you are using a bait optimized for fire ants, check the product label for the words \"fire ant bait.\" Many of these products are available only to licensed professionals.\tTable 1. Common Bait Insecticides for Fire Ant Control Available in California 2013.\tThese baits are applied as broadcast applications—not in bait stations.\nActive Ingredients (a.i.)\tProduct Name\tAvailability\tSpeed of Control\nHydramethylnon\tAmdro Pro Fire Ant Bait\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to slow\nAmdro Fire Ant Bait\tHomeowners\tModerate to slow\nAbamectin\tAscend Award II\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to slow\nFipronil\tMaxforce FC Fire Ant Bait\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to slow\nPyriproxyfen\tDistance, Esteem\tProfessional Use Only\tSlow\nSpinosad\tConserve\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to slow\nMethoprene\tExtinguish\tProfessional Use Only\tSlow\nMethoprene + hydramethylnon\tExtinguish Plus\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to slow\nIndoxacarb\tDuPont Advion Fire Ant Bait\tProfessional Use Only\tModerate to fast\nSpectracide Fire Ant Killer Plus Preventer Bait Once and Done!\tHomeowners\tModerate to fast\nNot listed in Table 1 are plastic bait stations containing various insecticides. These small stations are generally more useful for indoor use against other ant species and are not likely to have much effect on large outdoor infestations of fire ants. Products not labeled as fire ant baits, such as mound treatments and broadcast granules containing cyfluthrin, deltamethrin, pyrethrin, acephate, d-limonene, permethrin, bifenthrin and lambda-cyhalothrin, are not recommended. These products may give a quick reduction in visible ants, but they generally kill only foraging workers and do not give good long-term results in reducing the colony. Many of these products also have greater potential of running into groundwater than do the baits, and all the pyrethroid products have been found in urban creeks at levels toxic to aquatic wildlife. If you hire a pest control operator, the merits of the different treatments with respect to efficacy and safety for the environment should be discussed before treatments are applied.

    "damagePestNote": "Psyllids suck plant juices and excrete sticky honeydew on which blackish sooty mold grows. Some species secrete pale or white wax masses, pellets or strands, or coverings called lerps. High psyllid populations reduce plant growth or cause terminals to distort, discolor, become galled, or die back. Certain species, such as the olive and tipu psyllids, can cause premature leaf drop. The eugenia and peppertree psyllids cause leaves to develop a pit around the spot where each nymph settles and feeds. Excessive honeydew excretion and wax secretions can also damage plants or property below the infested foliage. Pear psyllid, Psylla pyricola, injects a plant toxin that blackens and “burns” pear foliage and fruit skins. The potato, or tomato psyllid, Bactericera cockerelli, occasionally causes infested potato to develop yellow, severely distorted, dwarfed leaves and shoots. The adult vectors (introduces during its feeding) the bacterial pathogen causing “zebra chip” disease, which causes fried potatoes to develop prominent black stripes. The Asian citrus psyllid, Diaphorina citri, damages citrus directly by feeding on new leaf growth (flush) and is a vector of the bacterium Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus that can result in the lethal and incurable citrus disease huanglongbing.",
    "managementPestNote": "Most psyllids on landscape trees and shrubs do not need to be managed to protect plant health. Species warranting control action include Asian citrus psyllid and, in certain situations, other invasive psyllid species that cause intolerable damage (see Table 1). When taking control actions use an integrated program incorporating appropriate plant care and certain insecticides, preferably less-persistent products that provide adequate control and help conserve natural enemies. Exclude Foreign Pests Many of our worst pests were introduced from other states or countries. To prevent new pest introductions during planting and travel:\tDo not bring fruit, plants, seeds, wood products, or soil into California unless you know they were certified as being pest-free or inspected by agricultural officials. This includes some online purchases that may not go through the required inspection process.\tClean up, dispose of, or remove diseased or infested plant material in ways that assure pests are not moved to new locations. Many introduced pests that are in California have not yet spread throughout the entire state. These can be kept localized unless people inadvertently spread them.\tBuy only pest-free plants from reputable, local nurseries.\tTake any unfamiliar pests to the local county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension office for identification or telephone the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Exotic Pest Hotline at 1-800-491-1899. Be sure you put pests in a sealed bag or bottle before transporting them. Monitoring Most psyllid damage is aesthetic. Tolerance for aesthetic damage varies with people’s attitude and knowledge and the situation, such as the location and species of plants and psyllids. Except for adults, such as the Asian citrus psyllid, that vector plant pathogens most psyllid damage is caused by feeding nymphs. Determine the level of damage you are willing to tolerate and monitor psyllid abundance on susceptible plants on a regular basis. Initiate control actions before psyllid abundance or damage approach the level that you previously found to be intolerable. To help you decide whether and when to take control action, monitor psyllids by using sticky traps to capture adults, beat or shake foliage to dislodge adults so they can be counted, and inspect susceptible plant parts for eggs, nymphs, and adults. Regular monitoring helps you determine whether natural enemies are becoming more abundant and may provide the needed levels of biological control or the most effective time to take action, if management with pesticides is warranted. In addition to monitoring psyllids, observe the seasonal growth of plants. Periodically examine plants for the presence and relative abundance of new growing tips, which typically are softer, somewhat differently colored, and undersized in comparison with older tissue. You may discover an annual cycle to psyllid abundance; population increases typically coincide with new plant growth. Conversely, the presence of large numbers of psyllid adults may not be a cause for concern when there is no longer any new flush of growth for egg laying, as the season is ending. The same number of adults observed when a plant is weak or growing poorly might warrant closer attention. Traps Hang yellow, sticky-coated traps in host plants as an efficient way to monitor the presence and relative abundance of adult psyllids and certain psyllid parasites and predators. Adults of many types of insects are attracted to the yellow color and become stuck to the trap. A significant increase in the number of psyllids in traps can indicate it is time to make a foliar spray of contact insecticide or to shear prune plant terminals (such as with eugenia) to remove psyllid-infested tips while still conserving parasites as discussed below. Inspect traps once each week and count (or estimate) and record the number of adult psyllids and their natural enemies. If insects are abundant, you can estimate their numbers by using five range categories: no psyllids, 1 to 10, 11 to 25, 26 to 100, or more than 100 psyllids per trap. Count and record the psyllids separately from the natural enemies. Following each count, scrape off all the insects and debris or replace traps if they are too fouled. Periodic cleaning or replacing of traps is essential to keep the surface sticky and make it easier to identify and count newly trapped insects. Beat or shake sampling Adult psyllids, certain natural enemies, and other easily dislodged insects can be detected and counted by shaking or tapping infested terminals to knock insects onto a collecting surface underneath foliage. Hold a light-colored plastic tray, framed cloth, or clipboard with a white sheet of paper beneath foliage or place a small cloth on the ground beneath low-hanging branches. To dislodge insects onto the collecting surface, shake or beat the branch a fixed number of times, such as once or twice. A typical program may sample from four locations per plant, one branch from each cardinal direction. Do this once each week during the time of year when psyllids can be a problem, generally spring to midsummer for most species. Monitor about the same time of day, preferably early morning when temperatures are cooler, which makes adults less active and easier to count. In most situations you can ignore any dislodged immature psyllids. Adults are the egg-laying stage and the seasonal cycle of the adult populations, highs and lows, indicates when the damaging nymphal stages are likely to become more or less abundant. Cultural Control To suppress populations of phloem-sucking insects, such as psyllids, provide appropriate irrigation and do not apply nitrogen fertilizer to established woody plants, unless foliage appearance or plant growth is unsatisfactory because of a confirmed nutrient deficiency. Be aware that foliar symptoms of nutrient deficiency are often caused by poor root health and improper soil conditions, such as waterlogged soil from inadequate drainage and frequent irrigation, alkaline (high pH) soil, and root infection by fungal pathogens. Adding fertilizer will not remedy these problems. For plants adapted to summer rainfall, consider irrigating them during summer and fall. For eucalyptus, drought stress increases damage from both lerp psyllids and longhorned borers. For established plants, apply water beneath the outer canopy, not near trunks. Avoid frequent, shallow watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate established trees infrequently (possibly once a month during drought periods) but with sufficient amounts so that the water penetrates deeply into soil (perhaps about 1 foot or more below the surface). Waterlogging (soggy soil), especially near the trunk, favors root and crown diseases. The specific amount and frequency of water needed varies greatly depending on the site conditions and plant species. Minimize shearing or clipping of terminals. Shearing stimulates new growth, which is preferred by psyllids for feeding and egg laying. Prune by cutting plants just above branch crotches and nodes instead of shearing off terminals. An exception is eugenia and other shrubs that are sheared several times each year to provide a smooth, dense canopy surface for ornamental purposes, such as formal hedging or topiary pruning. Well-timed shearing can suppress eugenia psyllid populations. Avoid planting problem-prone plants and consider replacing them with pest-resistant species and cultivars that are well adapted to local conditions. See the examples below for the acacia, eucalyptus, and peppertree psyllids. Biological Control Parasites and predators biologically control many native and certain introduced psyllid species. Important natural enemies of psyllids include lady beetles, lacewing larvae, predaceous bugs, and tiny parasitic wasps. Psyllids under moderate to good biological control include the bluegum psyllid and, especially in coastal regions, the redgum lerp psyllid. The acacia, eugenia, and peppertree psyllids are under good biocontrol in warmer locations but are sporadically abundant in coastal regions (Table 1). Introduced parasites have also reduced the abundance of lemongum psyllid and spottedgum lerp psyllid and in some coastal locations this biological control may keep these pests from becoming an intolerable problem. In most situations these species warrant no management except to conserve natural enemies. Species-Specific Management Methods Acacia Psyllid A purplish predatory bug and a small black lady beetle generally provide good biological control of acacia psyllid (Table 1). However in San Francisco Bay coastal locations, these predators may not become effective until June or July. Tolerate psyllids for several weeks when they are temporarily abundant, typically during April and May, and conserve natural enemies until predators provide control. Alternatively, temporarily reduce high populations by thoroughly covering new outer and upper canopy acacia growth with a nonresidual or short-residual insecticide as discussed below. To entirely eliminate the problem, replace susceptible plants. See Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs for Acacia and Albizia species that are not preferred by acacia psyllid. Asian Citrus Psyllid Buy citrus and other Rutaceae family plants only from reputable local nurseries to avoid introducing into new areas this psyllid or the citrus-killing pathogen that causes huanglongbing (HLB) disease, also called citrus greening disease. In locations not known to be infested with Asian citrus psyllid, inspect your citrus trees once a month whenever tiny new leaves (feather flush growth) are present during warm weather, especially in the spring and fall. Slowly walk around each tree and examine new flush growth. Look for twisted leaves, waxy deposits, honeydew, sooty mold, and adult psyllids. Distinguish psyllids from aphids, scales, whiteflies, and certain other insects that can also cause honeydew and sooty mold. If you think citrus psyllids are present, use a hand lens to examine succulent leaf tips for tiny yellow eggs, psyllid nymphs with waxy tubules, and psyllid adults. If you think you have found this psyllid in uninfested locations, immediately contact the CDFA Exotic Pest Hotline at 1-800-491-1899. In certain areas the CDFA may apply insecticides to residential host plants to control this psyllid. In known infestation areas, consider applying insecticide yourself or hiring a pest control company to control this psyllid and help protect citrus from the psyllid-vectored huanglongbing disease. In citrus, if applying systemic insecticide to soil as discussed below, make the application during summer or early fall when roots are active and plants are not blooming or about to bloom. A parasitic wasp, Tamarixia radiata, from Pakistan has been released and established in California and is spreading. This natural enemy can help to control Asian citrus psyllid, if Argentine ants and other invasive ants are selectively controlled as discussed in Pest Notes: Ants. These pest ants harvest honeydew from Asian citrus psyllid nymphs and protect them from natural enemies. See Pest Notes: Asian Citrus Psyllid for more information. Eucalyptus (Gum Tree) Psyllids In regions with summer drought consider providing eucalyptus trees with supplemental water during summer and fall as described above in Cultural Control. Drought-stressed eucalyptus are more susceptible to psyllids and Phoracantha species longhorned borers. Apply water beneath the outer canopy infrequently but with sufficient amounts so that the water penetrates deeply into the soil. For example, about once per month water trees slowly through drip emitters that run continuously for several days. Avoid fertilizing eucalyptus because this increases tree susceptibility to psyllids. Use slow-release nutrient formulations if other plants near eucalyptus trees require fertilization. When planting trees choose species that are well adapted to local conditions, including tolerance for the prevailing moisture conditions. Consult Pest Notes: Eucalyptus Redgum Lerp Psyllid for more information on Eucalyptus species’ relative susceptibility to leaf-chewing beetles, longhorned borers, and psyllids; and consider planting species that are not susceptible to these pests. Eugenia Psyllid In cooler areas near the California coast, eugenia psyllid parasite populations may not increase quickly enough to provide satisfactory control during the spring. Where pruning or other control methods are planned, inspect plants regularly for new growth beginning in late winter. Also consider regular monitoring for adult psyllids, especially when managing many eugenia plants. Regular shearing of terminals reduces eugenia psyllid abundance and is the only way to eliminate damaged foliage, aside from waiting for old leaves to drop. No pesticide or other treatment will restore pitted foliage to a healthy appearance. Prune terminals after maximum spring growth appears or about 3 weeks after the first peak in adult psyllid density, as determined using methods described above in Monitoring. Consider shearing eugenia tips at about 3-week intervals throughout the period of new plant growth or as long as adult psyllids are abundant. Leave eugenia clippings as mulch near the shrubs for at least 3 weeks to allow parasites within psyllid nymphs to complete their development and emerge. Eugenia psyllid eggs and nymphs on the cut foliage will die. Olive Psyllid Avoid frequent irrigation near olive tree trunks and provide good soil drainage to improve tree health and resistance to pests. Prune off or thin interior limbs in hot locations to increase psyllid exposure to heat and increase air circulation, which suppresses its populations. Natural enemies are being investigated for potential introduction. Where psyllid populations were intolerable the previous year and insecticide use is planned, target the first generation, typically present March to April. Olive psyllids are more difficult to control during their second generation (May to June), when most of their waxy excrement and damage occurs. Peppertree Psyllid Peppertree psyllids are often satisfactorily controlled by an introduced parasitic wasp, Tamarixia schina . No additional control is required in many situations. Peppertree psyllid produces relatively little honeydew and its distortion of foliage can be easily overlooked on the finely divided leaves of pepper trees, especially on branches above eye level. To improve pepper tree health and its ability to tolerate psyllids, provide adequate soil drainage and remove irrigated landscape near trunks. These practices are more important methods of improving pepper tree health than applying pesticides. Pepper trees are adapted to well drained, sandy soil and summer drought. Planting trees in heavy clay soils and in lawns and other summer-watered landscapes promotes root diseases and causes trees to decline and die. In cooler locations, where biological control is less effective, consider growing alternative species if psyllids cannot be tolerated. Australian willow myrtle or peppermint tree, Agonis flexuosa ; desert willow, Pittosporum phillyraeoides ; and Australian willow, Geijera parviflora, are relatively drought-tolerant and have a weeping appearance that resembles the pepper tree; but they are not affected by the peppertree psyllid. Avoid planting Peruvian pepper, Schinus terebinthifolius ; it is invasive in natural areas of California where it forms dense thickets and displaces native plants. Chemical Control Where psyllids or their damage are intolerable and insecticides will be applied, the most appropriate product will depend on the situation. The recommended products may include nonresidual, contact insecticides; short-residual, translaminar insecticides; and long-lasting, systemic insecticides. Apply insecticide only to psyllid host plants and in situations where psyllids and their damage cannot be tolerated. Completely read and follow the product label instructions for the safe and effective use of the insecticide. Insecticides Most Compatible with Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Nonresidual contact insecticides and certain short-residual products have the least adverse effect on bee and natural enemy populations. If psyllids were intolerable the previous year, the best time to spray these products is when young psyllid nymphs are present and before psyllids have become too abundant or produced excessive waxiness or other damage. Thoroughly spray infested parts, such as succulent terminals and the underside of leaves. More than one application per season is generally needed during the times when psyllids are most active.\tTable 1.

Nonresidual, contact insecticides have low toxicity to people, pets, and pollinators. They have little adverse impact on biological pest control, because they do not leave toxic residues that would kill natural enemies migrating in after their application. Nonresidual contact insecticides include azadirachtin (AzaMax, Safer Brand BioNeem), neem oil (Green Light Neem, Schultz Garden Safe Brand Neem), insecticidal soap (Safer), and narrow-range oil (Bonide Horticultural Oil, Monterey Horticultural Oil). Unless plants are too tall to achieve adequate coverage and avoid excessive drift of spray, these products are an especially good choice on acacia, eugenia, pepper tree, and other hosts with natural enemies that may not provide biological control until later in the season or are only partially effective at that location. Spraying nonpersistent insecticides early in the season before natural enemies build up and migrate from nearby unsprayed plants is compatible with late-season biological control. Monitor after the application. If natural enemies become abundant, avoid spraying again. Spinosad Spinosad is a fermentation product of a naturally occurring bacterium. This insecticide (Captain Jack’s Deadbug Brew, Conserve, Monterey Garden Insect Spray) persists about 1 week. It has translaminar activity (is absorbed short distances into plant tissue) so it can better reach psyllid nymphs in leaf and shoot crevices and pits in comparison with the products above. Spinosad can be toxic to certain natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, syrphid fly larvae) and bees when sprayed and for about 1 day afterward; do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Insecticides More Toxic to Psyllids and Beneficial Insects Systemic neonicotinoids are the most practical insecticides for psyllids infesting large plants and where the more IPM-compatible products are inadequate. Neonicotinoids such as dinotefuran (Safari) and imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Merit) are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., roots or trunks) and moved (trans- located) to other plant parts. Some products can be sprayed onto plant foliage, but drenching or injecting soil, or for woody species injecting or spraying trunks (if the product is labeled for these application methods), minimizes environmental contamination and may be more effective than spraying foliage. Trunk application of systemic insecticide can provide relatively rapid control. With soil application, there is a longer time delay between application and insecticide action. Neonicotinoids have low, moderate, or severe adverse impact on natural enemies and pollinators, varying with the product, situation, and the species and life stage of invertebrate. Neonicotinoid insecticides can translocate to flowers and poison natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. Delay systemic insecticide application until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering, unless the product label directs otherwise. Where other plants grow near treated plants, those other plants may also take up some of the soil-applied insecticide or become contaminated with insecticide spray drift. Delay soil application or foliar spraying of systemics when possible until the nearby plants are also done flowering. To avoid tree injury and potential spread of pathogens on contaminated tools, use a soil application or trunk spray whenever possible instead of injecting or implanting trees with insecticide. Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. If injecting or implanting multiple trees, prevent the potential spread of pathogens on contaminated tools. Before moving to work on each new tree, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate trees and disinfect them with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach). Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Insecticides to Avoid Carbamates (such as carbaryl), the systemic organophosphate acephate (Lilly Miller Ready-to-Use Systemic, Orthene), nonsystemic organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (fluvalinate, permethrin) also can be applied. Except for infestations of the Asian citrus psyllid, these insecticides are not recommended. These materials are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause outbreaks of spider mites or other pests. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Psyllids are aphidlike insects that secrete sticky honeydew. Some species produce white wax, distort leaves and shoots, stunt plant growth, or cause defoliation. Management includes providing proper plant care, conserving natural enemies of psyllids, and applying low-toxicity insecticides when needed. Most plants can tolerate low to moderate numbers of psyllids. Plants commonly affected include: Acacia, boxwood, eucalyptus, eugenia, pepper tree, and some other ornamentals Pear, potato, and tomato Damage resembles that from some aphids, scale insects, and whiteflies. Look for: Abundant sticky honeydew that psyllids excrete as they suck plant sap Black sooty mold growing on the honeydew Curly or powdery wax or, in certain species, crystallized covers called “lerps” Distorted or galled leaves or shoots or prematurely dropping foliage Learn to recognize psyllids. Adults are 1⁄10 to 1⁄5 inch long and hold their wings rooflike over their bodies. Adults are quite active, often jumping away when disturbed. Nymphs are flattened and oblong to round. Some can move, but pit-making species remain stationary. Nymphs of several species that feed on eucalyptus are hidden under hardened covers (lerps). To reduce problems, use an integrated approach. Provide plants with appropriate environmental conditions and cultural care, especially proper irrigation; conditions vary for each location and plant species. Choose plant species or cultivars that psyllids don’t infest or that are less susceptible to these pests, such as certain acacia and eucalyptus. Learn how to recognize and conserve psyllid parasites and predators. Certain psyllids can be controlled by these natural enemies. Avoid stimulating succulent growth by reducing fertilization and unnecessary pruning. For topiary eugenia, shear growing tips about every 3 weeks and leave the clippings as mulch on the ground for at least 3 weeks to allow beneficial parasites time to emerge. What about pesticides? Don’t treat plants with insecticides unless you have an intolerable psyllid infestation. Avoid insecticides that injure natural enemies. Common natural enemies of psyllids include lady beetles, pirate bugs, and parasitic wasps. If you must treat, select insecticidal soaps, oils, and other least-toxic products, or use a soil-applied systemic insecticide for especially intolerable problems. Systemic insecticides may be toxic to honey bees and other beneficial insects so avoid using them during bloom. ",

Its appearance and biology is similar to that of the sequoia pitch moth.",
    "damagePestNote": "Pitch moth larval feeding causes infested conifers to produce copious amounts of resin that form globular masses on bark. Larvae cause very little injury to cambium or wood; this damage usually does not cause girdling of the trunk and rarely kills trees. Larval feeding sometimes causes one or more limbs to die or break, especially if infested trees are young. Sequoia pitch moth is the more common of these Synanthedon spp. and is usually the only one that is managed. It frequently attacks pines with pruning wounds or other injuries, and its damage is most prevalent in planted Monterey pine (Table 1).",
    "managementPestNote": "Protect trees from injury, as moths prefer to lay eggs on bark near pruning wounds and other injury sites. Provide trees with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation, to increase a tree’s ability to tolerate pitch damage. The only direct control is to pry off or carefully scrape away each pitch mass to expose and kill the larva or pupa. No other control is known or recommended. Insecticide applications have been found not to be effective for pitch moths. Cultural Control Small limbs infested with larvae and pitch masses can be pruned off, but this is not recommended, as it can lead to future infestations around the pruning wound. If pines must be pruned, prune only from October through January, so that injuries begin to close before egg-laying adults emerge in spring. Prune in a way that enhances wound closure, by making cuts just outside the branch bark ridge and branch collar. Stake pines only if needed to protect or support the trunk or to anchor the root ball during the first year or so after planting. Remove any stakes that came from the nursery and, if needed, restake the plant. Do not tie or fasten trunks firmly; allow the main stem to flex without rubbing on stakes. Remove ties and stakes promptly when they are no longer needed, usually within two years after planting. For more information, see Planting Landscape Trees. Keep weed trimmers and lawn mowers away from trunks, and maintain an area several feet wide around the base of each trunk that is free of turf and other vegetation. Also protect trunks from other sources of injury, such as from vehicle bumpers. Plant only species that are properly adapted to the area. Certain pines are much less susceptible to sequoia pitch moth than others, so consider planting a more resistant species (Table 1). Learn the cultural requirements of pines, and provide proper care to maintain vigorous growth. Appropriate irrigation is especially important to tree health. Inappropriate watering, whether it is too frequent or inadequate irrigation, damages trees, and this is probably the most common problem with landscape plants. When irrigating established trees, apply water beneath the outer canopy, not near trunks. Avoid the frequent shallow watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate infrequently, possibly once a month during drought periods, but with sufficient amounts so that the water penetrates 1 to 2 feet into the soil. This can be achieved by applying water slowly through drip emitters that run continuously for about one to three days. The specific amount and frequency of water needed varies greatly depending on the site and tree species. Physical Control Scraping away or prying off resinous pitch cankers is the only recommended, direct method of controlling pitch masses and larvae. If resin masses are carefully excised, larvae or pupae can be found and killed. Properly removing pitch masses from all nearby trees, along with appropriate cultural practices, can reduce reinfestations and control local clearwing moth populations. Inadequately removing pitch masses allows a larva or pupa to survive and mature into an adult that can reinfest trees. Only one larva or pupa occurs in each pitch mass, although several adjoining masses sometimes merge. Unless the mass has become reinfested, no insect will be present in masses older than about two years, because the insect will have matured and emerged as an adult. Each pitch mass gradually enlarges, hardens, and darkens as the larva beneath it matures. Learn to distinguish newer pitch masses from older ones in order to recognize where the insect is most likely to be found (Table 2). Larvae are easily overlooked, because their pinkish to gray color resembles the color of pitch. Young larvae, those found in smaller pinkish masses, typically occur below the bark surface within a small cavity that they have chewed in the inner bark. Pupae and older, larger larvae occur in grayish pitch masses. These older insects are usually found near the surface of the mass, somewhat outward from the bark cavity they had created when younger. If pitch masses are simply scraped away without actually locating and killing or disposing of the larva or pupa, the insect can survive and cause a new pitch mass to develop at that site. Pupae or older larvae can survive in discarded pitch masses unless insects are crushed or bagged and disposed of away from trees. Gently pry or scrape a pitch mass off of the bark using a screwdriver or stiff putty knife. Locate the insect on the underside of the mass or in the tree wound and puncture or crush the larva or pupa. Work carefully to avoid further wounding of the bark. Because they are harder and larger, older masses are relatively easy to remove by prying at several locations around their edges until the whole mass can be lifted off. Smaller masses have a softer, stickier consistency that may have to be scooped out. Unless the larva is definitely located and killed during pitch removal, scrape slightly upward within the bark cavity and remove as much of the pitch as possible to increase the likelihood of killing the young larva.\tTable 2.

    "damagePestNote": "Pantry pests damage food by contaminating it with their bodies and their by-products. The larval stage of the Indianmeal moth produces frass (excrement) and webbing, and some beetle larvae produce secretions that give food a disagreeable odor and taste. Setae (hairs) from the warehouse beetle can irritate the mouth, throat, and stomach of people who eat infested products. In addition, pantry pests might introduce microbes into the food that could produce mycotoxins (highly carcinogenic compounds), especially if the food is stored in warm, humid conditions.",
    "managementPestNote": "Getting rid of food-infesting moths or beetles takes continuous, persistent effort at removing and cleaning up the infestation, especially if it has been present for a while. Some pests are capable of living for many weeks without food; thus the threat of reinfestation exists until they die off or are killed. It is best, at least for several months after eliminating the infested products, to store any susceptible food in airtight containers or in a refrigerator or freezer. Also, as a general practice, storing infrequently used food items (e.g., pancake flour, grains, spices, and so forth) in the freezer prevents infestations from developing. Pheromone traps are available in many retail stores to monitor and trap Indianmeal moths and other pantry pests. Insecticides aren't recommended for any of the pantry pests. If you find small moths or beetles crawling or flying around your kitchen, look for the food source of these pests and remove it immediately. If you locate the infestation before it spreads to other packages, control may be relatively easy. The source is commonly a package damaged at the store or an opened one that is little used or forgotten. The best thing to do with the package is seal it up and dispose of it, removing it from the house immediately. Cleaning Up an Infestation Most commonly, by the time the insects are noticed, they have already spread to other food packages. Carefully inspect all packages, especially those that have been opened or are exposed. Destroy any that give the slightest indication of infestation. Other than the insects themselves, telltale signs include webbing in tight places of a package or tiny holes in the container. Insects are less likely to invade packages that have their original seal but more commonly infest those that have been opened or that have been on the shelf for a long time. Before replacing noninfested packages, wash shelves with soap and water, scrubbing corners and crevices or vacuuming them with a crevice attachment to remove eggs and pupae. Pheromone Traps Pheromone traps are readily available for several different pantry pests, although pheromone traps specifically designed for the Indianmeal moth won't attract beetles. There are some traps (e.g., Pantry Patrol) that attract several different pantry pest species, including the Indianmeal moth, red flour beetle, confused flour beetle, warehouse beetle, and cigarette beetle. Use pheromone traps to detect pests that remain in the house after the source of the infestation has been removed. Pheromones are chemicals produced by an organism to affect the behavior of other members of the same species. In the case of the Indianmeal moth, a sex pheromone attracts adult male moths into the trap where they get stuck on the sticky sides; these traps won't attract the female moths but may reduce their ability to produce eggs if the traps catch males before they can mate. The pheromones used to attract the flour beetle species are aggregation pheromones that attract both sexes. Food oil lures are also contained in some traps. Place the traps in the area of a previous infestation and check them weekly. Most traps remain effective for about three months. Whenever you catch a new batch of moths or beetles in traps, it is time to inspect food packages again for an infestation. Prevention and Sanitation Most home infestations of pantry pests maintain themselves on spills in the crevices of cupboards and drawers or in opened packages of food stored for long periods of time. Following a few general guidelines when storing food products will help you avoid many potential problems:\tDon't put exposed food on shelves. Place it in containers with tight-fitting lids; plastic bags aren't adequate.\tRegularly clean shelves, bins, and all other locations where there is any possibility of flour or other food particles accumulating. Certain pests need only small amounts of food to live and breed. Soap and water are great for cleaning flat areas, and vacuuming with a crevice attachment will help clean cracks, edges, and corners.\tDon't mix old and new lots of foodstuffs. If the old material is infested, the pest will quickly invade the new.\tClean old containers before filling them with fresh food. They may be contaminated and cause a new infestation.\tDon't purchase broken or damaged packages of food materials. They are more likely to become infested.\tConstruct storage units so that they are tight and can be easily cleaned.\tStore bulk materials, such as pet foods, in containers with tight-fitting lids.\tKeep storage units dry. This is important because moisture favors the development of pantry pests, while dryness discourages them.\tSome pantry insects breed in the nests of rodents and insects and may migrate from these into homes. Eliminate any nests found in or near the home.\tPantry pests can also breed in rodent baits. Be sure to frequently check and discard infested baits. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Pantry pests are insects such as certain moths or beetles that can attack almost any kind of stored food, from spices to cereal to chocolate. Pantry pests usually enter your home in an infested package of food. You might not notice these small insects until you see moths flying around your kitchen or beetles crawling in your food. Get rid of these pests by removing infested food, tightly sealing stored dry food, and thoroughly cleaning the area. Types of pantry pests and their damage. The Indianmeal moth is the most common moth found on food products in the home. Several species of beetles, including the warehouse beetle, the sawtoothed grain beetle, the red flour beetle, and the cigarette beetle, commonly attack a variety of foods. Infested food can be contaminated with insect hairs, droppings, webbing, and secretions. Food contaminated with warehouse beetle hairs can irritate your mouth, esophagus, and digestive tract. Pantry pests can introduce microbes that rot food, especially in warm, humid conditions. Detecting pantry pests. Adult moths or beetles are usually easier to spot than the larvae. Inspect all packages, especially those that have been opened. Webbing in tight places of a package or tiny holes in a food container are signs of a pantry pest infestation. Use a pheromone trap labeled for pantry pests to detect them. By the time you spot a pantry pest, it has usually spread to other food packages. Preventing a pantry pest infestation. Store food in containers with tight-fitting lids, not plastic bags. Store bulk goods like pet food in airtight containers. Keep certain infrequently used food like flours, spices, and grains in a freezer if possible. Wash old containers before filling them with new food. Don’t mix old and new food together. Clean shelves, bins, and other food storage areas regularly. Cleaning up a pantry pest infestation. Throw away any food that has even the slightest evidence of infestation. Vacuum corners and crevices of cupboards to get rid of eggs and pupae, and wash shelves with soap and water. Pantry pests are capable of living for many weeks without food; continue using pheromone traps to detect pests after the source of the infestation has been removed. What about pesticides? Insecticides are not recommended for controlling any pantry pests. Spraying pesticides on or near food may cause greater harm to you and your family than would pantry pests. Even if you have a large infestation of pantry pests, removing infested material and following the guidelines above will provide effective control. ",

    "damagePestNote": "Moth flies do not bite people or animals, and they cause no damage to structures or plants. However, because these flies develop in the decaying organic matter found in sink and sewer drains or even wet manure and raw sewage, they have the potential to carry pathogens acquired at these development sites to areas where sterility is important, such as health care facilities and food preparation areas. Moth flies may also affect human health when present in high numbers, because the bodies of dead flies may disintegrate to form potential allergens. In addition to these health risks, moth flies are also nuisance pests, especially when present in large numbers or when they land on people or fall into food. Where large development sites are present, flies can be so numerous that it can be difficult to talk without swallowing them!",
    "managementPestNote": "Inspection and Prevention The key to managing moth flies is the elimination of breeding sites. In residential homes, the most common developmental sites are bathroom drains. In commercial facilities and restaurants common developmental sites include sink and floor drains in food preparation areas, grease traps, mop drying tubs, and evaporation pans placed beneath appliances. When adults are found within a room, first examine all the drains within the room for the presence of moth fly larvae. Because moth flies are weak flyers, adults can often be found very near to their development site. The presence of adults within a drain or resting on walls near a drain is a clear sign that this drain is a development site. Flies may be developing in more than one drain, so all drains in the room where adults are found should be inspected for moth fly larvae. Check drains by removing the drain plate and scraping the slime from the sides of the drain using a dull knife or similar device that will reach several inches into the open drain. Look for larvae within the collected slime. If larvae are not found in the slime that can be scraped from exposed drainpipes, it may be that moth flies are developing in organic material found much deeper within the pipes. A more thorough assessment of moth fly development within a drainpipe can be made using a drain fly trap. Coat the inside of a cup or jar with Vaseline or vegetable oil and then invert the cup to cover the drain opening. Any moth flies emerging from within the pipe will stick to the inside of the trap. Traps should be placed over all drains within an infested room and left in place for 24 hours. Following this exposure period, examination of the traps will indicate which drains are development sites. While moth flies are most commonly found developing in organic buildup within drains, they will develop in a wide range of wet organic detritus that may be found in a home or commercial facility. If all drains have been inspected and flies were not found to be developing in them, additional locations that might contain wet organic material should be inspected. Moth flies have been found developing in elevator pits, around sump pumps, and in material beneath leaking drain and sewage pipes. Pipes in crawlspaces, wall voids, and the underside of concrete slabs may need to be inspected for breaks or leaks if developing moth flies are not found in drains or other exposed locations. When inspecting for moth fly development sites, keep in mind that these flies can sometimes disperse from off-site sources. Moth flies can often be produced in very large numbers at sewage treatment facilities and dispersed via wind to nearby homes and buildings where they can accumulate in large numbers. However, in these instances, the flies are typically present in greater numbers outside the structure than within the structure. Physical Methods Physical control is an integral part of eliminating moth flies. Physical control methods will vary, depending on where the flies have originated. If flies are developing within the home or other structure, removal of larval habitat will provide suitable control. A common misconception is that pouring boiling water and/or bleach down a drain will control these flies. However, these treatments do not remove the organic film within the drain; and they provide at best short-term control of flies. To remove the organic film within the drain, use a hard bristle brush with an industrial drain cleaner. Drains may need to be snaked first to clear any blockage causing slow draining and also to prevent further buildup of organic material within the drain. For sinks equipped with a J trap underneath, the trap should be removed and cleared of organic debris. After cleaning the drain, run water through the drain to ensure that water flows freely. In addition, regular use of an enzymatic drain cleaner may help to prevent the organic buildup that provides a good development site for moth flies. Similar removal of wet organic material followed by cleaning will eliminate development sites in exposed locations. If development sites are not exposed (e.g., within wall void or beneath a structural foundation), a professional pest control service should be contacted for advice. Flies produced at an off-site source (e.g., a sewage treatment facility) where favorable larval habitat cannot be removed are best managed through exclusion practices. Flies can be excluded from a structure using mesh screens placed over building openings, including air vents. All windows should be screened, and torn or damaged screens should be replaced. Air curtains placed above doors will help to reduce flies that might enter as the doors open. Lastly, it is important to consider the role of light attraction to moth flies. Flies are often attracted to structures during the evening hours by external building lights. Lights should be placed away from doors or other building openings to reduce fly access to the interior of the building, and lights near the structure should use sodium vapor lamps or insect lights, which are less attractive to moth flies. Chemical Control Chemical control is generally considered unnecessary for moth fly management, as control will only be temporary unless larval development sites are located and removed. The use of insecticides to control these flies in residential homes is particularly discouraged because usually only one or a few drains are involved and cleaning them can provide an effective long-term solution. In nonresidential urban structures, the application of nonresidual chemicals such as pyrethrins formulated as ultra low volume (ULV) fogs or space sprays may provide immediate control of adult flies where sterility is an issue but should be combined with the removal of larval development sites. Insecticides may also be utilized when the flies are produced off-site or larval development sites cannot be eliminated. In these cases, treatment with a residual pesticide applied to resting surfaces may provide some relief. Pesticide applications should be made only by those licensed to do so. A professional pest control company should be consulted in cases where pesticide applications are considered. When applying pesticides, be sure to read the product label and follow instructions for application closely.",

    "damagePestNote": "Female mosquitoes of nearly all species require blood from vertebrate animals such as people, pets, livestock, and wildlife. The most important consequence of this feeding is the acquisition and later transmission of viruses that cause human diseases including Western equine encephalomyelitis, St. Louis encephalitis, and West Nile virus disease. These viruses, which are transmitted predominantly by Culex mosquitoes, can cause serious, sometimes fatal, neurological ailments in people. Western equine encephalomyelitis and West Nile viruses also can affect horses and occasionally other domestic animals. Most people infected with mosquito-transmitted viruses show no symptoms or only mild, flu-like symptoms that may not result in a visit to the doctor. However, severe symptoms following infection occur in a small percentage of people. Western equine encephalomyelitis infections tend to be more serious in infants, whereas St. Louis encephalitis affects older people. West Nile virus infections can range in severity from no detectable symptoms to West Nile fever to severe neuroinvasive diseases such as West Nile encephalitis, West Nile meningitis, or West Nile meningoencephalitis. For more information, see the sidebar on West Nile virus. In 2011 and 2013, California was invaded by two species of Aedes mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus) that can transmit some of the most debilitating and deadly mosquito-borne viral pathogens known to humans, such as Zika virus, dengue virus, chikungunya virus, and yellow fever virus. These mosquitoes had previously been found in California but vector control practitioners were able to eliminate the infestations before they were able to spread very far from the introduction site. However these two mosquitoes have spread across Southern California, the Central Valley, and into the San Francisco Bay Area (see the map of Aedes mosquito detections: www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/CDPH Document Library/AedesDistributionMap.pdf). A third species, Aedes notoscriptus, was found in California in 2014 and has been detected in Los Angeles and San Diego. The transmission cycles of the Aedes -transmitted viral pathogens differ from West Nile virus cycles in several important ways. First, the primary epidemic cycles in urban habitats involve the transmission of viral pathogens between humans and Aedes mosquitoes. In the tropics, other animals and mosquitoes can be involved in forest transmission cycles, even in the absence of humans. Second, infected humans can transmit some of these viruses to mosquitoes even if they do not show disease symptoms. Like West Nile virus infections, transmission through other pathways such as blood transfusion and organ transplants is possible. It is rare that these viruses are transmitted from mother to child; however, Zika virus can be transmitted through the placenta or during birth, and is unique among these closely related viruses in that it can be sexually transmitted. Many Aedes mosquitoes are intimately associated with human activities and are difficult to control. First, they utilize small and often cryptic sites for immature development. Any small amount of standing water, perhaps even a bottle cap holding water, can support larvae, making detection very difficult. Carrying out inspections of all the possible larval development sites in an urban area is time-consuming and prohibitively expensive. Backyards that contain assorted debris are especially difficult to census. Second, the eggs are resistant to drying and remain viable for months or longer. The tiny eggs, only about 0.025 inches long, are typically laid along the water-air interface or on damp surfaces. The eggs serve as a “seed bank” that facilitates reinvasion of an area cleared of larvae and adults, and enables undetected movement of the mosquitoes to new locations. Not all of the eggs hatch when inundated for the first time, so mosquito larvae can continue to be produced with repeated wetting and drying. Third, many populations show significant levels of resistance to insecticides commonly used to control mosquitoes. The difficulties associated with the detection and control of these invasive mosquitoes highlight the need for new and novel approaches for vector control. Some Anopheles mosquitoes found in California can transmit the parasites that cause human malaria. If these mosquitoes feed on a person who has malarial parasites in their blood, the insects can pass on the infection when they bite other people. Endemic malaria was eradicated from California by the 1940s; however, travelers have occasionally reintroduced the parasite, which has led to several small outbreaks. Mosquitoes can transmit dog heartworm in California. Tree holes that fill with water, especially in the foothill areas of the state, harbor the larvae of the principal Aedes vector of this disease. Some Culex mosquitoes that live in cities and residential areas, as well as some Aedes mosquitoes found in rural areas, can also transmit dog heartworm. Even when mosquitoes don’t transmit the causative agents of infectious diseases, they can be a serious nuisance and a health problem to people, livestock, and wildlife. Mosquito bites can result in secondary infections, allergic reactions, pain, irritation, redness, and itching.",
    "managementPestNote": "WEST NILE VIRUS\tWest Nile Virus (WNV) is a virus that infectious mosquitoes transmit to susceptible vertebrate hosts such as humans and birds. More than 60 species of mosquitoes have been found to be infected with WNV, although most of these species don’t play a significant role in the natural transmission cycles of WNV. Mosquitoes in the genus Culex are the most important vectors, or carriers, of WNV in the United States.\tThe primary cycle involves the transmission of WNV between some species of birds and Culex mosquitoes. Humans and domestic animals can develop serious symptoms from WNV infection but usually are “dead-end” hosts, because they don’t produce enough virus to infect mosquitoes that feed on them.\tWNV infections have rarely occurred through other pathways such as blood transfusion, organ transplants, and breastfeeding, but enhanced screening of blood and organ supplies have virtually eliminated transmission by these non-mosquito sources.\tIn North America, WNV outbreaks usually start in the summer and continue into autumn. About 80% of people who are infected with WNV won’t show any symptoms. Mild symptoms, which appear in about 20% of the people who become infected, include fever, headache, body aches, nausea, vomiting, and sometimes swollen lymph glands or a skin rash on the chest, stomach, and back. The symptoms can last for only a few days up to several weeks.\tAbout one in 150 people infected with WNV will develop a neurological illness that sometimes results in death. Symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, vision loss, numbness, and paralysis. These symptoms can resolve themselves in several weeks or be permanent.\tCurrently no vaccine against WNV is available for humans. Even though a vaccine for WNV is available for horses, they still aren’t routinely vaccinated across the United States, and mortality rates in horses can be as high as 40% for clinical WNV infections.\tIn many areas of California, public mosquito and vector control agencies aim to keep mosquito numbers down to tolerable levels all or most of the time. However, some Californians live in areas where no organized mosquito control exists. These usually are low-density areas in foothill, mountain, or desert regions. Where mosquito populations become bothersome, people can protect themselves and others from mosquitoes by using a variety of strategies. These include keeping fine mesh screens on windows and doors in good repair, draining standing water or treating it with a control agent such as Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti), incorporating mosquito-eating fish into isolated ponds and neglected swimming pools, and wearing repellents and protective clothing outdoors when mosquitoes are active. Cultural Control Around the Home The most effective control methods are those targeted against the larval stage of the life cycle. If you have an area or object that can hold water for more than a few days, drain it, fill it with soil or cement, or treat it with a mosquito control agent. Even small containers such as soda cans, glass jars, flower pot saucers, or tree holes can provide a habitat for mosquito development. If not maintained regularly, storm drains, water treatment basins, and wetlands can be places of prolific mosquito production near neighborhoods. Water capture structures such as rain barrels and landscape drainage systems can also produce high numbers of mosquitoes that affect entire neighborhoods. Rain barrels should be mosquito-proofed by either covering access points to the water with window screen or closing openings with a sealant. Keep barrel filters and pre-filters clean of debris. Perform regular inspections to be sure that your system does not have cracks or leaks, and that all fittings and seals around the valves are intact. For situations where screens or completely sealed barrels are impractical, Mosquito Dunks are time-release rings that float on the water surface and contain a bacterial agent (Bti) which kills mosquito larvae, but does not affect people, animals or plants. Clean all gutters and downspouts. Leaves, twigs, seeds, and other organic matter that block water flow can create standing water in which mosquito larvae can grow. You can trap mosquitoes using a variety of products. Homeowner groups have participated in trapping programs to collect and kill egg-laying mosquitoes. Such efforts require the deployment and maintenance of many traps (e.g., 2 or more traps per yard) to reduce mosquito numbers. Traps, such as the Mosquito Magnet, release carbon dioxide to attract host-seeking mosquitoes. However, you’ll want to weigh the cost of the trap and its operation against the fact that although the trap attracts mosquitoes searching for a host to feed on, it captures only a small proportion of the attracted insects. Also, a single trap might not be effective enough for controlling adult mosquitoes, which often disperse across a broad geographic area. Electric bug zappers used to kill pest insects are counterproductive, because many of the insects these traps kill are those that prey on mosquitoes. Keep in mind that some adult mosquitoes can fly several miles from where they develop. Even successful control of mosquito larvae on your premises might not result in eliminating mosquito numbers or biting activity. See Table 1 for ways to reduce mosquito populations in each situation.\tMosquito-eating fish. Mosquito-eating fish, Gambusia affinis, can be an important control agent for immature mosquitoes. These fish are most effective in man-made bodies of water that don’t connect with natural waters and don’t contain dense stands of emergent vegetation. You can obtain mosquitofish from most vector control districts. You never should release mosquitofish into streams, ponds, and lakes because these fish aren’t native to California. It is also illegal to do so. Fish native to California are being considered for use as mosquito control agents in habitats where mosquitofish cannot be released. Your local vector control district is a good source of additional information for mosquitofish alternative Chemical Control Insecticides Used in Water.\tBacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) is a bacterium that forms spores which produce proteins toxic to mosquito larvae. To be effective, mosquito larvae must eat the compounds, which act as a stomach poison that damages mosquito midgut cells. Like the closely related forms of Bt used by gardeners to control specific insect pests, Bti is highly selective, killing only mosquitoes and the larvae of a few other related flies. This biopesticide is not effective against pupae, since they don’t feed. Bti is marketed in a variety of formulations for the homeowner, the most common being Mosquito Dunks which last for about 30 days in water. Methoprene is an insect growth regulator (IGR), a mosquito hormone mimic that is applied to standing water and inhibits the emergence of adult mosquitoes. Examples of commercially available formulations include Altosid Pro-G and Pre-Strike Mosquito Torpedo. Spinosad is a neurotoxin produced naturally by some bacteria and is used as an insecticide against many types of insects. For mosquito control, it is sold as Natular DT and appled to standing water.\tOutdoor Sprays. Using insecticide sprays or outdoor foggers for controlling adult mosquitoes has limitations. While they can provide a temporary reduction of the adult population—which can be useful if you make the application shortly before a backyard picnic or family gathering—alternative, more long-term approaches for controlling mosquitoes are preferable. Equipment for applying outdoor sprays is expensive and complex. The use of systems that continuously release small amounts of insecticides is not recommended. Regardless of the product that you choose to use against mosquitoes, always follow the instructions for the amount and appropriate habitats for use found on the product’s label. It is a violation of federal law not to follow the instructions on the label! Personal Protection Probably the best way to protect yourself from mosquito bites is to avoid places where their densities are high and avoid being outside when mosquito activity is at its highest. In mountainous areas, most mosquito species bite during morning and afternoon hours and often not at all when it is dark. In some low-elevation areas, such as the Central Valley, some mosquitoes tend to bite at night, while others bite during the day. Here are some ways to protect yourself from mosquito bites:\tMaintain conditions around the home to reduce contact with mosquitoes.\tRepair broken window and door screens.\tEliminate small pools of standing water.\tReduce time outdoors, particularly in early morning and evening hours when host-seeking Culex mosquitoes are most active.\tWear long pants and long-sleeved shirts.\tApply mosquito repellent to exposed skin and to clothing.\tRepellents. If you find yourself in a situation where you can’t avoid mosquitoes, first minimize the amount of exposed skin surface by wearing a hat or head net, long trousers, and a long-sleeved shirt. Some mosquitoes will bite through lightweight clothing, but the number of bites you receive will decrease if you cover most areas of your body. When mosquito densities become very high, it is best to apply a mosquito repellent. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends using products containing active ingredients registered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for use as repellents applied to skin and clothing. An EPA registration indicates the active ingredients of repellents have been tested for human safety when applied according to the instructions on the label. The CDC currently recommends two general types of repellents for use on skin: conventional and biopesticide repellents. Conventional repellents include compounds such as DEET (N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide or N,N-diethyl-3-methyl-benzamide) and Picaridin (KBR 3023: 2-[2-hydroxyethyl]-1-piperidinecarboxylic acid 1-methylpropyl ester). DEET and Picaridin are used most commonly to repel mosquitoes. Biopesticide repellents are derived from natural materials or are synthetic versions of the natural product. The synthetic form of oil of lemon eucalyptus (OLE: use only when formulated as a repellent. The pure form of OLE is not currently registered by the EPA.) and IR3535 (3-[N-Butyl-N-acetyl]-aminopropionic acid, ethyl ester) are two recommended biopesticide repellents. A synthetic alternative to natural OLE is PMD (para-menthane-3,8-diol) and is recommended by the CDC. PMD isn’t recommended for use on children younger than 3 years old. These repellents are available at retail outlets under different product names: the active ingredient and its percentage in the formulation are listed on the label of each product. New repellents are continually being developed and tested. The federal government’s latest recommendations for mosquito repellents can be found on the CDC’s website: wwwnc.cdc.gov/travel/yellowbook/2020/noninfectious-health-risks/mosquitoes-ticks-and-other-arthropods and EPA’s website: www.epa.gov/insect-repellents. A repellent’s effectiveness and duration of protection vary considerably among products and mosquito species. Effectiveness typically lasts 4 or fewer hours depending on wind, high temperatures, high humidity, and perspiration amounts. In general, higher concentrations of active ingredient provide a longer protection time, regardless of the active ingredient, although concentrations greater than 50% don’t offer a marked increase in protection time. Products with less than 10% active ingredient might offer only limited protection, often only 1 to 2 hours. Products that offer sustained release or controlled release (micro-encapsulated) formulations, even with lower active ingredient concentrations, might provide longer protection times. Regardless of which product you use, if you start to get mosquito bites, reapply the repellent according to the label instructions or remove yourself from the area if possible. DEET is the most effective mosquito repellent if you will be out for long periods where mosquitoes are abundant. However, DEET is an irritant to some people, and repellents containing high DEET concentrations can damage synthetic materials such as clothing or plastics. Apply sparingly to all exposed skin. Special formulations for children contain low concentrations of the chemical in an oil-based medium that slowly releases the compound and limits its absorption through the skin; these formulations also work well for adults. If you wish to avoid DEET, many of the EPA-approved alternative repellents are as effective or are more effective for some people than are low concentrations of DEET, especially when only short-term repellency (fewer than 2 hours) is desired and mosquitoes aren’t very abundant. In addition to the previously mentioned repellents, plant oils such as those from birch, bluestem grass, geranium, pine, rosemary, spearmint, yarrow, lantana, and neem somewhat repel mosquitoes; but most aren’t available in commercial mosquito repellents. The insecticide permethrin functions as a repellent when applied to clothing, but it should never be applied directly to skin. The EPA recommends several precautions when using insect repellents.\tApply repellents only to exposed skin and clothing; never use repellents underneath clothing.\tDon’t apply repellents over cuts or irritated skin.\tNever spray repellents directly onto your face; apply the repellent onto your hands first, then use your hands to apply the product sparingly onto your face and head.\tNever let children handle repellents.\tA small amount of repellent is sufficient to effectively deter mosquitoes.\tAfter returning indoors, wash treated areas with soap and water.\tIf you develop a rash after using a repellent, wash the affected area with mild soap and water and seek guidance from a physician or poison control center.\tAlways read and follow the directions on the product’s label.\tOther Repellent Products. Research has shown that the effectiveness of most other products marketed to repel mosquitoes differs appreciably. Some products such as clip-on dispensers emitting metofluthrin which kills and repels mosquitoes have shown some promise in limited studies. Manufacturers claim that clip-on, battery-operated dispensers for the pyrethroid pesticide metofluthrin repel mosquitoes for up to 12 hours per refill; but like most repellents, effectiveness varies among users. Wristbands that contain an aromatic repellent, ultrasonic emitters, electric grids, electronic repellers, aromatic plants (the most common one is the so-called mosquito plant, Pelargonium x citrosum), incense coils, vitamin B1, and mixtures of brewer’s yeast and garlic are ineffective. Oil of citronella, which is extracted from Andropogon nardus, has a reputation for repelling mosquitoes. Burning citronella candles or mosquito coils containing allethrin works best if there is relatively little air movement, but these products are only for use outdoors.\tMosquito and Vector Control Agencies The goal of mosquito management is to keep populations below levels where they become a nuisance or a public health problem that leads to an outbreak of disease. Mosquito management often occurs on an areawide basis by public agencies that either are part of local health departments or are independent mosquito and vector control districts organized specifically for mosquito control. California has more than 60 mosquito and vector control districts. Some are small and have responsibility for mosquito abatement in a city or portion of a county, while the activities of others can encompass one or more entire counties. Vector control technicians search out mosquito larvae in standing water, collect adult mosquitoes to monitor the abundance of problematic species and determine the presence of disease-causing pathogens, and use evidence from surveillance to choose control measures that are as cost-effective and environmentally friendly as possible. Control measures include environmental manipulation to reduce aquatic habitats such as removing dense patches of decaying vegetation conducive to mosquito production, applying mosquito-specific control agents, and stocking fish that feed on the larvae. Many materials currently in use are biological in origin and are highly specific for mosquitoes while having little or no effect on other organisms. Occasionally, mosquito abatement agencies may have to use chemical pesticides to kill adult mosquitoes; ordinarily this occurs only when adult populations become so large they cause extreme annoyance to many people or when the threat of an outbreak of a disease is high.\tTable 1.

    "contentQuickTips": "Mosquito adults are small flying insects that bite people and animals and can spread diseases. The females require blood from humans or other animals to develop eggs. Mosquitoes can transmit disease-causing organisms such as West Nile Virus. Certain mosquito larvae live and grow in ponds, objects containing standing water, and other aquatic sites. Decrease your chances of getting bitten by reducing standing water around your home, using repellents, and wearing protective clothing when outdoors. Minimize mosquito breeding habitats. Empty water from unused garden pots and other objects. Store containers upside down, cover, or dispose of them so mosquitoes can’t lay eggs. Change water in pet dishes, watering troughs, and bird baths every week. Avoid overwatering, which can lead to standing water. Keep litter and garden debris out of street gutters. Remove debris from rain gutters and downspouts at least once a year. Seal rain barrels and keep all filters and prefilters clean and free of moisture-retaining debris. Inspect regularly for leaks. For ponds, remove excess vegetation, stock with mosquito-eating fish, or use Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) products such as Mosquito Dunks, Plunks, or Bits, which contain a bacterial agent that kills mosquito larvae but doesn’t affect people, other animals, or plants. Maintain water quality in swimming pools with chemical treatments. Keep water off swimming pool covers. Cover or drain water from plastic pools when not in use so mosquitoes can’t lay eggs. Fill open tree holes with sand or mortar. What is the West Nile virus? West Nile Virus is spread by mosquitoes that get the virus from infected birds. Once infected, mosquitoes then transfer the virus to humans and other animals. Infected humans can become very ill. The disease usually is most serious in children, people with weakened immune systems, and the elderly. For more information about West Nile Virus, visit the California Department of Health Services. The best defense is to avoid mosquito bites! Be sure doors and windows are properly screened. Avoid being outdoors at times of the day when mosquito activity is high in your area, especially at dawn and dusk. Wear long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, socks, and a hat if you must be outside when mosquitoes are present. Use insect repellents containing DEET, picaridin, or the slightly less effective Oil of Lemon Eucalyptus (PMD). Repellents containing other ingredients may be less effective and must be reapplied frequently. Always follow label directions. Outdoor insecticide sprays can temporarily reduce the number of adult mosquitoes but have no lasting effect. See Pest Notes: Mosquitoes for more details, or contact your local mosquito abatement or vector control district for more information about or assistance with managing these insects.",

Mealybugs are favored by warm weather and thrive in areas without cold winters or on indoor plants.",
    "damagePestNote": "Mealybugs suck sap from plant phloem, reducing plant vigor, and they excrete sticky honeydew and wax, which reduces plant and fruit quality, especially when black sooty mold grows on the honeydew. Large accumulations of mealybugs, their egg sacs, and wax can be unattractive. High populations feeding on foliage or stems can slow plant growth and cause leaf drop; however, healthy plants can tolerate low populations without significant damage. Ground mealybugs, which are not very common in landscapes and gardens, feed on roots and can cause plant decline but are generally not seen until plants are dug up and roots are exposed. Many types of perennial plants are affected by mealybugs. Among fruit trees, citrus has the most problems, but mealybugs may sometimes be found on stone fruits or pome fruits, although rarely at damaging levels. Mealybugs can build up in grapes, especially the vine mealybug, a new invader that attacks roots as well as aboveground parts, but the grape, obscure, and longtailed mealybugs also occur. Many woody ornamental plants and some herbaceous perennials can be infested including cactus, coral bells (Heuchera), figs (Ficus), flax grasses (Phormium), fuchsia, gardenia, hibiscus, jasmine, mimosa, Miscanthus grasses, and oleander. The cypress bark mealybug can be a serious pest on Monterey cypress in urban areas and also attacks other species of cypress, cedar, and juniper. Plants growing indoors or in greenhouses are especially vulnerable because year-round mild temperatures favor mealybug populations, and indoor plants are usually not exposed to the natural enemies that often keep mealybugs under control outdoors. Among houseplants, aglaonema, coleus, cactus, dracaena, ferns, ficus, hoya, jade, orchids, palms, philodendron, schefflera, poinsettia, and various herbs including rosemary and sage often have problems with aboveground mealybugs. Ground mealybug infestations are most often reported on African violet and gardenias. Some mealybugs, such as those infesting grapevines, can transmit viruses, but these aren’t usually a major problem in gardens and landscapes. The pink hibiscus mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus, which currently is only established in Imperial County in California, has saliva that is especially toxic to plants.\tTable 1.

    "managementPestNote": "Mealybugs are very difficult to manage with insecticides. Fortunately most species have natural enemies that keep their populations below damaging levels in outdoor systems such as landscapes and gardens. The best approach to managing mealybugs is to choose plants known to be less prone to problems, inspect plants for mealybugs before bringing them onto your property, and rely on biological control and cultural practices to keep mealybug numbers in check. Cultural Practices Mealybugs are often introduced into landscapes (and especially into indoor areas) on new plants or on tools or pots. Because adult females can’t fly and mealybugs can’t crawl very fast, they don’t rapidly disperse in the garden on their own. Inspect any new plants thoroughly for mealybugs before installing them. If you can’t remove all the mealybugs present, discard and destroy the plant or, if possible, take it back to the source. Regularly inspect mealybug-prone plant species in your landscape or indoor plantings for mealybugs. If you find an infestation, physically remove the insects by handpicking or prune them out. Toss out older “grandmother” plants that may be a source of infestation for new plants. Check pots, stakes, and other materials for mealybugs and their egg sacs and dispose of any infested items. If mealybugs are somewhat exposed, it may be possible to reduce populations on sturdy plants with a high-pressure or forcible spray of water. Repeat applications at several-day intervals may be necessary. Avoid unnecessary applications of nitrogen fertilizer on plants with mealybugs. High rates of nitrogen coupled with regular irrigation may stimulate tender new plant growth as well as mealybug egg production. If your landscape or interiorscape has a history of serious mealybug problems, consider using only plant species that are not prone to mealybugs for at least a year or two to reduce mealybug density and harborage potential. Ground mealybugs are even more difficult to control than those that feed aboveground. Prevent introduction of ground mealybugs and quickly dispose of infested plants before the pests can move onto clean plants. Biological Control Many natural enemies feed on and kill mealybugs on fruit trees and woody ornamental plants in the landscape. These beneficial insects generally can be relied upon to keep numbers at tolerable levels. Natural enemies include a number of species of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs in or on developing mealybugs. Common parasites (or \"parasitoids\") include species in the genera Coccophagus, Leptomastix, Allotropa, Pseudaphycus, and Acerophagus. Look for parasite pupae within mealybug colonies, or emergence holes in mummified mealybugs. Leptomastix dactylopii is sold commercially for release in greenhouses, citrus groves, and interiorscapes, but it kills only the citrus mealybug. Naturally occurring predators of mealybugs include lady beetles, green and brown lacewings, spiders, minute pirate bugs, and larvae of predaceous midges. The mealybug destroyer lady beetle, Cryptolaemus montrouzieri, is the most important of these predators in many areas. It does not tolerate cold winters, so it is more common in southern California and in coastal areas. The mealybug destroyer can be purchased for augmentative release and is often released in greenhouses and interiorscapes or in citrus orchards after a cold winter has killed off native populations. Adult beetles are bicolored with reddish-brown heads and hind ends and black in the middle; older mealybug destroyer larvae are covered with white wax, which makes them look somewhat like large mealybugs. When releasing mealybug destroyers, focus on periods when there are many mealybug egg sacs, because the lady beetles require mealybug eggs as food to stimulate their own reproduction. There is little point in releasing them when mealybug numbers are low or when they are not reproducing. Operators of greenhouses or interiorscapes with regular mealybug problems can establish their own mealybug destroyer colonies for self-release. The lady beetle can be reared in wide-mouth jars on mealybugs grown on sprouted potatoes or other hosts. A ring of petroleum or other sticky material smeared inside jars around the top will prevent the flightless mealybugs from crawling out but allows the lady beetles to fly out into the greenhouse. Preserve naturally occurring biological control agents by avoiding use of broad-spectrum insecticides for any pests in the area. Also keep ants out of mealybug-infested areas and plants because ants protect mealybugs from their natural enemies. Chemical Treatment Nonchemical methods usually provide sufficient control for outdoor plantings in gardens and landscapes. Home and garden insecticides are not very effective for mealybugs, especially on larger plants. The mealybugs’ waxy coating repels most contact insecticides, and their habit of aggregating in hidden locations makes them hard to reach. For houseplants, greenhouses, and interiorscapes where it is not physically possible to remove mealybugs and where biological control may not be feasible, spot treatment may be used to suppress populations of aboveground feeding mealybugs. Spot Treatment with Isopropyl Alcohol On small infestations on houseplants, a 70% or less solution of isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol in water may be dabbed directly on mealybugs with a cotton swab to kill them or remove them. Test the solution out on a small part of the plant 1 to 2 days beforehand to make sure it does not cause leaf burn (phytotoxicity). In some cases, a much more diluted solution may be advisable. Where infestations are extensive, a 10-25% solution of isopropyl alcohol can be applied with a spray bottle. You will need to repeat this procedure every week until the infestation is gone. Insecticides Insecticidal soaps, horticultural oil, or neem oil insecticides applied directly on mealybugs can provide some suppression, especially against younger nymphs that have less wax accumulation. Be sure to test for phytotoxicity of these materials prior to treatment as well. Products containing the systemic insecticide dinotefuran may reduce mealybug numbers on some landscape plants, and plant spikes or granules containing the related insecticide imidacloprid may reduce mealybug crawler numbers on houseplants. These neonicotinoid products are less reliable against mealybugs than against other piercing-sucking insects in many situations. Their use should be avoided when possible, especially on flowering plants, because of potential negative impacts on natural enemies and pollinators. Other insecticides, including pyrethroids, are also labeled for some situations but may not be much more effective than soaps and oils and can be devastating to natural enemies. Be aware that none of the available insecticides will likely provide complete control of all individuals, and that you will need to monitor and treat again as needed. When infestations become severe, consider discarding houseplants rather than repeatedly treating them with insecticides. On outdoor plants, cultural practices and biological control should be adequate for suppressing mealybugs in most situations.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Mealybugs are small, soft, wax-covered insects that are common problems on houseplants and on outdoor plants in areas with mild winters. Usually found in groups or colonies, mealybugs suck plant sap and often produce sticky honeydew which can cover leaves. Manage mealybugs by purchasing pest-free plants, discarding infested plants, and relying on biological control outdoors. What do mealybugs look like? Most adult mealybugs are wingless females with oval, segmented bodies covered with wax. Males have wings but are rarely seen. Newly hatched mealybug immatures (nymphs) lack wax and can move around plants but soon settle down and produce a waxy covering. Different mealybug species can be distinguished by the length of the waxy filaments around their bodies. They may be confused with cottony cushion scale, woolly aphids, soft scales, and whiteflies, which also produce wax and honeydew. Mealybugs are sometimes hard to see because they often live in protected areas of plants such as in the crown of a plant, in branch crotches, or on stems near the soil. Signs and damage from mealybugs. Signs of an infestation might include white, cottony egg masses on plants, wax-covered plants, sticky honeydew, black sooty mold growing on top of honeydew or ants feeding on honeydew. Mealybugs suck sap, weakening the plants. High populations can slow plant growth and cause leaf drop. Although many plants are attacked, citrus, grapes, bird of paradise, cactus, coral bells, cypress, fuchsia, hibiscus, mimosa, and indoor plants are the most commonly infested. To reduce problems, use a combination of practices. Inspect plants thoroughly before bringing them into your home and landscape and discard infested ones. If you find mealybugs on a houseplant or in your garden, hand pick or prune them out. If the infestation is serious, remove the whole plant. Once you’ve found the pest, continue monitoring plants, pots, and stakes on a regular basis. Reduce large exposed populations with a high-pressure spray of water, repeating this every few days as needed. Outdoors, protect natural enemies of mealybugs such as parasitic wasps, predatory insects (e.g. lady beetles and lacewings), and spiders. Use nitrogen fertilizer correctly. Over application combined with regular irrigation stimulates new plant growth where mealybugs prefer to lay eggs. For serious problems on indoor plants, a solution of 70% (or less) isopropyl alcohol and water could be used to clean off mealybugs. Test on plants for phytotoxicity first and reduce concentration as necessary. What about pesticides? The protective waxy cuticle of adult mealybugs and their tendency to hide makes contact insecticides less effective. Insecticidal soaps, horticultural oils, and neem oil applied directly to immature mealybugs can reduce numbers. Other insecticides labeled for use against mealybugs can be harmful to beneficial insects and should be avoided in the garden. ",

    "name": "Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees ",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7473.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Leafrollers, the larvae of certain tortricid moths, often feed and pupate within the protection of rolled-up leaves. Several species can cause problems on fruit and ornamental trees in California. The fruittree leafroller, Archips argyrospila, is the most common leafroller pest in landscapes throughout the state. It occurs on many ornamental trees—including ash, birch, California buckeye, box elder, elm, locust, maple, poplar, rose, and willow—and is particularly damaging to deciduous and live oaks. It also attacks numerous fruit and nut trees including almond, apple, apricot, caneberries, cherry, citrus, pear, plum, prune, quince, and walnut. Other leafrollers include the obliquebanded leafroller, Choristoneura rosaceana, and the omnivorous leafroller, Platynota stultana, which are serious problems on fruit trees. The orange tortrix, Argyrotaenia franciscana, and apple pandemis, Pandemis pyrusana, are pests that occur throughout the year primarily on fruit trees and vines in coastal areas of California. A new invader, the light brown apple moth (LBAM), Epiphyas postvittana, recently has invaded the northern coastal areas of the state, and high populations are found in areas with cool summers with high humidity such as the San Francisco Bay Area and the Santa Cruz-Monterey region, where it is causing damage to ornamental and fruit trees. Damage and management for all species is similar. Leafrollers go through four stages of development—egg, larva (or caterpillar), pupa, and adult (or moth). Adults lay eggs in irregular, flat masses on smooth surfaces. The fruittree leafroller usually lays its egg mass on twigs or smaller branches. At first a dark gray or brown “cement” coats the mass; this later bleaches to white. Pinholes perforate this covering in spring as larvae hatch and emerge through it (Figure 1). Omnivorous and obliquebanded leafrollers sometimes lay their eggs on weeds or leaves as well as on twigs. Most leafrollers lay eggs in overlapping rows that resemble fish scales (Figure 2). Larvae of these leafrollers feed inside the protective shelter of leaves that they roll or web together (Figure 3). When disturbed, the larvae wriggle vigorously and quickly drop to the ground on a silken thread (Figure 4). Newly hatched fruittree and obliquebanded leafroller larvae are entirely green except for a black head and small, hard plate just behind the head. As the larva matures, its head turns dark brown, and the plate becomes tan to olive green (Figure 5). At maturity larvae are 3/4 to 1 inch long. Omnivorous leafroller larvae are pale green or light brown with brown or black heads and are a little more than 1/2 inch long when full grown. The larvae of the light brown apple moth are very similar to other leafrollers—pale to medium green with a light tan head—and cannot be reliably distinguished from some other leafroller species in the field. If you are not in or near an area where this pest occurs, it is likely another species; however, take suspicious specimens to your County Agricultural Commissioner for identification. For the most current information about this invader, visit the California Department of Food and Agriculture’s Web page. When mature, leafrollers pupate within a rolled leaf. Silk webbing lines the area around each pupa. Adult moths are about 1/2 inch long with a wingspan of about 5/8 to 7/8 inch. Wings of leafrollers have a bell-shaped outline when viewed from above. The forewings of the fruittree leafroller are mottled shades of brown and tan with gold-colored flecks (Figure 8) while the hind wings are whitish to gray. It is difficult to distinguish between adults of various leafroller species, although the omnivorous leafroller has a longer snout. Leafrollers are difficult to distinguish in the field. However, information related to geographical location and the plant being attacked can be helpful in determining which species is attacking the host specimen (Table 1).",
    "life_cycle": "The fruittree leafroller spends the winter in the egg stage and has only one generation a year. Other leafrollers spend the winter as larva in protected places on the host and have two or more generations. The fruittree leafroller overwinters as eggs laid on branches or twigs. Eggs hatch into tiny larvae from March to as late as mid-May in cooler areas. Larvae feed on leaves for about 30 days then pupate in a loose cocoon, which they form in a rolled leaf or similar shelter. Eight to 11 days later the adult emerges from the pupa. The moths live only about a week, during which time they mate and lay eggs. They fly from May to June, depending on locality, and in any one area the flight usually lasts about three weeks. These moths lay eggs on twigs and branches, and the eggs will remain there until they hatch the next spring. Omnivorous, obliquebanded, light brown apple moth, and most other problem leafrollers overwinter primarily as larvae in protected places in trees. For example, omnivorous leafroller often overwinters in or on old, unharvested fruit, whereas obliquebanded leafroller often is found as second- or third-stage larvae under bud scales. They pupate in spring, emerge as adults, and sometimes lay their first eggs on weeds. The second generation of these leafrollers, which occurs in June or July, is more likely to occur on trees, causing damage later in the season than the fruittree leafroller.",
    "damagePestNote": "Leafroller larvae feed on tender, new leaves, giving them a ragged appearance; they also roll and tie leaves together with silken threads to form compact hiding places. Some years very large populations develop. In severe cases larvae can partially or completely defoliate trees, and their numerous silken threads can cover the entire tree and the ground below. Also, larvae frequently drop to the ground on their silken threads and can defoliate other plants beneath the trees. However, even completely defoliated trees can recover if they are otherwise healthy, with the exception of newly planted and first-leaf trees. Oaks in the Central Valley can be particularly hard hit by the fruittree leafroller. Some people mistake this leafroller for California oakworm because of its prevalence on oaks. However, oakworm is a more serious pest in coastal areas, while the fruittree leafroller does the bulk of its defoliation damage to oaks in the Central Valley. The two caterpillars are easy to distinguish—the fruittree leafroller is green with a black head, while California oakworm has yellow, black, and gray stripes on its side and a large, brown head. For more information, see Pest Notes: California Oakworm listed in the References section. The larvae of all leafroller species also attack fruit on trees, and young fruit might fall because of deep feeding grooves larvae make just after the fruit has formed. Less severely damaged fruit remain on the tree and develop characteristically deep, bronze-colored scars with roughened, netlike surfaces that are mostly cosmetic, although the fruit can become deformed (Figure 11). They do not enter the fruit as do codling moth or Oriental fruit moth.",
    "managementPestNote": "Biological Control A number of insects eat leafrollers including certain tachinid flies and ichneumonid wasps, which parasitize the larvae. After consuming the leafroller larvae, the braconid wasp forms a white cocoon next to the shriveled up worm inside its nest. A white cocoon is an indication that the parasite is present and might provide control. Lacewing larvae, assassin bugs, and certain beetles also are common predators. Birds sometimes feed on the larvae and pupae, although they usually prefer other insects. These natural enemies often help to keep leafrollers at low, nondamaging levels, but even if natural enemies are present, large outbreaks of leafrollers occasionally occur. Chemical Control Sprays for leafrollers seldom are necessary. Apply them only when there is evidence of a damaging leafroller population, such as large numbers of larvae early in the spring or large numbers of egg masses. Because the fruittree leafroller—the most common leafroller attacking oak and other ornamentals—has only one generation a year, by the time trees are severely defoliated, the caterpillar stage might be almost completed, and sprays will be of no benefit. Also, a single defoliation, unless the tree is very small, will not kill the tree. Insecticidal oil sprays applied in dormancy for scales and other insects will help control leafroller eggs on fruit trees. The microbial insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis, which is sold as a variety of products, is effective against the larval stages of leafrollers. Bt, as it is commonly known, is a bacterial preparation that causes a disease in many kinds of caterpillars but does not harm beneficial insects, birds, humans, or other organisms. Leafrollers stop eating within hours after feeding on a sprayed leaf and die several days later. Thorough spray coverage of the tree is required for control. Bt is most effective on leafroller larvae when they are small (less than 1/2 inch long) and usually requires more than one application. Caterpillars must ingest the pesticide to be killed. Bt is available for use on ornamental trees, vines, and some fruit and nut trees. Check labels for uses. Spinosad (Monterey Garden Insect Control) is another, organically acceptable insecticide that is effective against leafrollers and widely available. Optimum control and a minimum amount of damage by fruittree leafrollers occur when a spray is applied at the time of larval hatching or shortly afterward. To determine this time, inspect twigs showing flushes of new foliage and look for feeding injury and the small caterpillars. If you see egg masses, check them regularly for signs of larval exit holes. Fruit trees must be sprayed no later than petal fall to prevent larvae from injuring the young fruit. Use a high-pressure power or hose-end sprayer to force the material into the leaf rolls and other protected areas where larvae are found.",

Presently, the olive fruit fly occurs in all olive growing areas of California and threatens virtually all commercial and fruit-bearing ornamental olive plantings.",
    "damagePestNote": "The olive fruit fly poses a severe economic threat for the state’s commercial olive growers. The larvae (maggots) of the olive fruit fly feed inside the fruit, destroying the pulp and allowing the entry of secondary bacteria and fungi that rot the fruit and degrade the quality of the oil. Feeding damage can cause premature fruit drop and reduce fruit quality for both table olive and olive oil production. Large numbers of rotting fruit on the ground can create an unwelcome mess, especially in landscaped situations. In areas of the world where the olive fruit fly is well established, it has been responsible for crop losses of 100% of some table cultivars and up to 80% of oil value. It is considered the most devastating insect pest of olives in the Mediterranean region, where it has occurred for more than 2,000 years. For table olive growers, the presence of even a few infested fruit can lead to rejection of an entire crop. Some infestation can be tolerated in olive fruit used for oil production as long as the fruit are not rotten. Harvesting early and pressing infested fruit quickly after harvest will reduce off-flavor changes caused by olive fruit fly injury. Ornamental olive trees can serve as a source of olive fruit flies infestating commercial plantings, especially as adult flies are capable of flying long distances.",
    "managementPestNote": "The most efficient trap for monitoring the olive fruit fly is the glass or plastic McPhail-type trap baited with torula yeast lures. Yellow sticky traps baited with spiroketal sex-pheromone lures (attractive to male flies) and/or ammonium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, or diammonium phosphate food bait (attractive to both sexes) also are commonly used to monitor olive fruit fly populations, but these generally are less efficient than McPhail traps. Traps are discussed in detail in Management. The best method for controlling the olive fruit fly depends on if the tree is to be harvested and where it is located (backyard, landscape, or commercial grove). When planting olive trees that will not be harvested, consider the several varieties of fruitless olives that can be grown successfully in California including the full-size varieties Majestic Beauty, Swan Hill, and Wilsoni and the dwarf Little Ollie. They can be ordered through home and garden stores or retail nurseries. Fruitless olive varieties have the additional advantage of producing less pollen than fruiting varieties. Fruitless varieties are less likely to aggravate allergies and are more desirable for ornamental plantings. On existing trees, prevent fruit formation with a plant growth regulator or high-pressure water sprays during bloom. If you plan to harvest fruit, follow good sanitation and consider using traps, bait sprays, or barrier films. Plant Growth Regulators for Trees Grown as Ornamentals Only Use a plant growth regulator to prevent fruit formation in ornamental trees by applying it thoroughly to flowers during bloom. The chemical will cause the flowers to drop so that fruit will not be produced that year. Application timing is critical for effective fruit suppression. Growth regulators are available at home-and-garden stores including Florel (active ingredient–ethephon, manufacturer–Monterey Chemical). Another growth regulator, Embark (active ingredient–diethanolamine salt of mefluidide, manufacturer–PBI/Gordon), is available to licensed applicators only. When using any chemical, be sure to follow the label directions to prevent personal injury and tree damage. Any fruit that develops on the tree after applying a growth regulator spray should be removed and destroyed. Trees Grown for Fruit Management of olive fruit fly on trees with a crop to be harvested depends on a combination of tactics, especially mass trapping and cleaning up fruit after harvest. The few sprays currently available for home and landscape use include Surround at Home Crop Protectant. GF-120 NF Naturalyte Fruit Fly Bait is another product that can be used by homeowners and may be purchased through farm supply dealers. Traps. Traps baited with food lures can be used to reduce adult fly densities by mass trapping. One such trap was developed in Spain and is called an OLIPE trap (See References for additional information.). It is a homemade trap used in Spain to suppress olive fruit fly populations in organic olive groves and in sensitive areas near homes and natural parks. The OLIPE trap is made from a 1- to 2-liter plastic bottle with.20-inch (5 mm) holes melted into the shoulder. Current research in California suggests that Torula yeast tablets dissolved in water are very effective as bait. Traps are hung in the shade, and flies are attracted to the trap, crawling inside and dying. McPhail-type traps also can be used for mass trapping olive fruit flies. If used for this purpose, traps should be checked weekly during the summer to ensure that the water-based lure has not evaporated. The lure should be changed regularly to maintain maximum attraction. Several companies currently sell McPhail-type traps. Contact your local cooperative extension office for a source, or try a vendor such as Great Lakes IPM (www.greatlakesipm.com) or ISCA Technologies Inc. (www.iscatech.com). These and other mass trapping devices have been shown to reduce olive fly damage by 30% to as much as 100%. Mass trapping effectiveness also is quite variable and may not provide adequate control when used as the only control approach. Sanitation. Before harvest, an ongoing effort to pick up and destroy fallen fruit can help reduce olive fruit fly populations. Remove fruit as soon as possible once it is ripe to prevent the maggots from leaving the fruit and entering the soil to pupate. Collect fallen olives and remove as much fruit as possible from trees during the harvest process. After harvest, olive fruit left on trees or on the ground can result in continuing development of the olive fruit fly. Knock down remaining fruit from trees with a wooden or fiberglass pole. Be cautious of using metal poles near overhead power lines. Unused or fallen fruit should be destroyed by mulching or mowing or buried at least 4 inches deep. It is not known if composting the fruit would produce temperatures high enough to kill the maggots, but hot weather does greatly increase their mortality rate. Bait Sprays. GF-120 NF Naturalyte Fruit Fly Bait, an organically acceptable product containing the biologically produced insecticide spinosad, recently has received registration for use on olives in California. GF-120 can be purchased from a local farm chemical distributor. GF-120 attracts olive fruit fly adults, which feed on the bait, and causes adult mortality. GF-120 is concentrated and needs to be diluted with water at 1:1.5 to 1:4 (GF-120 NF: water) before application. Follow label instructions for methods of dilution. GF-120 applications should commence when olive fruit fly adults are captured on the monitoring traps or at least 2 to 3 weeks before pit hardening. Repeat applications every 7 days until harvest when flies are captured on monitoring traps. GF-120 should be applied at a 2.5 to 7.5 ounce dilute spray per tree using a 1:1.5 dilution or at a 5 to 15 ounce dilute spray per tree using a 1:4 dilution with very large droplet size. Droplets should be 5 millimeters or more in size and uniformly dispersed around the tree. The person applying the GF-120 is required to wear coveralls, waterproof gloves, shoes and socks, as well as follow all the requirements on the pesticide product label. Barrier Film Sprays. Surround (active ingredient–kaolin clay, manufacturer-Engelhard Corp.), is a barrier film that can be used to protect the fruit from attack. When sprayed so that thorough coating of fruit is achieved, it can be quite effective in preventing olive fruit fly damage by preventing egg laying and damage. This material alters the ornamental look of olive trees as it leaves them covered with white residue. Combination Treatments. A combination of mass trapping to reduce the olive fruit fly population together with one late season application of kaolin clay applied so that it thoroughly coats the fruit has been effective in research trials. The traps used for mass trapping should have their yeast bait changed every two weeks April through November. The barrier film spray should be applied as the fruit begins to be attacked in late summer or early fall. Biological Control. In sub-Saharan Africa, where it is believed to have originated, and in the Mediterranean area, the olive fruit fly is attacked by a number of parasitic wasps. However, the parasites common in the Mediterranean area do not provide acceptable control in commercial situations. Some naturally occurring parasites are known to attack olive fruit fly in California, but they do not appear to provide adequate control. Researchers from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the University of California, and the California Department of Food and Agriculture currently are working to identify and import natural enemies from Europe, Africa, Guatamala, and Hawaii to control olive fruit fly. It is hoped that one or more parasite species will someday provide acceptable control, especially in noncommercial and ornamental olive plantings. It may not be cost-effective to use only biological controls in commercial olive groves because of the commercial requirements for very low olive fruit fly infestation levels. However, suppressing olive fruit fly populations with biological control agents on untreated landscape trees, which otherwise serve as a source of adult olive fruit flies that disperse into commercial groves, will help reduce overall fly densities and potentially reduce the number of treatments needed in commercial groves to achieve control.",

    "damagePestNote": "Pit scales suck juices from twigs and cause twig dieback, which first becomes apparent in mid- to late summer. Dead leaves and twigs on affected trees may remain throughout the winter, giving the tree an unsightly appearance; however, don’t confuse this with the natural retention of dead leaves characteristic of a few oak species such as pin oak and Turkish oak. A severe scale infestation delays the leafing out of deciduous oaks for as long as three weeks in spring. Heavy attacks of pit scales year after year may kill young trees. The pitting effect scales cause is most noticeable on the bark of younger twigs. Surrounding the pit is a doughnut-shaped swelling with the scale in the center. If there are large numbers of scales, the pits coalesce, making the twig surface appear roughened and dimpled.",
    "managementPestNote": "Natural enemies of the pit scale are uncommon in California, although parasite exit holes may sometimes be observed. Insecticide application is the main tool currently available for managing these pests; however, it may be possible to prune out isolated areas of infestation if detected very early. Because heavy infestations over several years can kill young trees and weaken older ones, consider management actions as soon as problems are detected. Pit scales can be managed using narrow range oil applied to trees in spring just before buds open. Be sure to cover all branch tips and bark thoroughly. Thorough coverage can be difficult with very large trees unless high-pressure equipment is used. However, infestations on small- to medium-sized trees can be adequately managed with one annual application over several consecutive years. Insecticidal oil should be diluted to a solution of 1.5 to 2% (1.5-2 parts oil to 100 parts water). Once leaves are on the tree, it is too difficult to get the degree of coverage needed for oil treatments to be effective. Although mixtures of oil and persistent insecticides such as pyrethroids applied in spring to kill hatching crawlers can be effective, these sprays aren’t generally recommended for large trees in residential areas because of the environmental hazards associated with applying these insecticides and the difficulty of getting adequate coverage with available application equipment.",

Tables 1, 2, and 3 list some common garden plant species and their nematode pests.",
    "damagePestNote": "Root knot nematodes usually cause distinctive swellings, called galls, on the roots of affected plants. Infestations of these nematodes are fairly easy to recognize; dig up a few plants with symptoms (see below), wash or gently tap the soil from the roots, and examine the roots for galls. The nematodes feed and develop within the galls, which can grow as large as 1 inch in diameter on some plants but usually are much smaller. The formation of these galls damages the water- and nutrient-conducting abilities of the roots. Galls can crack or split open, especially on the roots of vegetable plants, allowing the entry of soil-borne, disease-causing microorganisms. Root knot nematode galls are true swellings and can’t be rubbed off the roots as can the beneficial, nitrogen-fixing nodules on the roots of legumes. Root knot nematodes can feed on the roots of grasses and certain legumes without causing galling. Aboveground symptoms of a root knot nematode infestation include wilting during the hottest part of the day even with adequate soil moisture, loss of vigor, yellowing leaves, and other symptoms similar to a lack of water or nutrients. Infested vegetable plants grow more slowly than neighboring, healthy plants, beginning in early to midseason. Plants produce fewer and smaller leaves and fruits, and ones heavily infested early in the season can die. Damage is most serious in warm, irrigated, sandy soils. Root injury from other nematode species can produce aboveground symptoms similar to those from root knot nematodes. However, the actual injury to the roots is more difficult to detect. Roots can be shortened or deformed with no other clues as to the source of the injury. You can confirm a nematode infestation by collecting soil and root samples and sending the material to a laboratory for positive identification of the infesting species. Although nematodes can kill annual plants, they rarely kill woody plants. Nematode injury to woody plants usually is less obvious and often more difficult to diagnose. Infested fruit and nut trees can have reduced growth and yields. Woody landscape plants that are heavily infested can have reduced growth and branch tip dieback and can defoliate earlier than normal. Detecting Nematodes in Soil Samples\nTable 1.

Often you become aware of a nematode problem by finding galled roots on a previous crop. However, you also can use a simple bioassay to detect root knot nematodes in garden soil. Melons seeded in pots in moist soil collected from the garden will develop visible galls on the roots in about 3 weeks when pots are kept at about 80ºF if root knot nematodes are present. As a comparison, melons planted in heat-sterilized soil won’t develop galls.",
    "managementPestNote": "Management of nematodes is difficult. The most reliable practices are preventive, including sanitation and choice of plant varieties. You can reduce existing infestations through fallowing, crop rotation, and soil solarization. However, these methods reduce nematodes primarily in the top foot or so of the soil, so they are effective only for about a year. They are suitable primarily for annual plants or to help young woody plants establish. Once nematodes infest an area or crop, try to minimize damage by adjusting planting dates to cooler times of the season when nematodes are less active. Try to provide optimal conditions for plant growth including sufficient irrigation and soil amendments to make plants more tolerant to nematode infestation.\tSanitation Nematodes usually are introduced into new areas with infested soil or plants. Prevent nematodes from entering your garden by using only nematode-free plants purchased from reliable nurseries. To prevent the spread of nematodes, avoid moving plants and soil from infested parts of the garden. Don’t allow irrigation water from around infested plants to run off, as this also spreads nematodes. Nematodes can be present in soil attached to tools and equipment used elsewhere, so clean tools thoroughly before using them in your garden. Resistant or Tolerant Varieties and Rootstocks One of the best ways to manage nematodes is to use vegetable varieties and fruit tree rootstocks that are resistant to nematode injury. Tomato varieties with the code VFN (Verticillium, Fusarium, Nematodes) on the seed packet or label are resistant to common root knot nematode species. Although even resistant tomato varieties can still exhibit some root galling under high nematode levels, they usually maintain their yield. For example in recent vegetable garden-type experiments on root knot nematode soil, nematode-resistant tomatoes yielded almost 6 times more tomatoes than a similar susceptible variety. An additional benefit of growing a resistant variety is the nematode levels in the soil decline rather than increase, making it more feasible to grow a susceptible crop the following season.\nTable 2.

Citrus trees growing on Troyer and Trifoliate rootstocks are resistant to the citrus nematode. Consider replacing severely infested plants with plant species and varieties that are more tolerant of the nematodes present. Unfortunately, resistant varieties aren’t available for many crops and ornamentals. Fallowing and Rotation Growing a crop on which the nematode pest can’t reproduce is a good way to control some nematodes. For example, the sugarbeet cyst nematode attacks only a limited number of crops including cole crops (broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, and cauliflower) and related crops and weeds. Growing nonsusceptible crops for 3 to 5 years reduces the sugarbeet cyst nematode population to a level where you can grow susceptible crops again. Unfortunately, rotation isn’t as easy for controlling root knot nematodes, because so many vegetable crops and weeds are hosts of the pest. However, with careful planning, rotation in combination with fallowing and solarization can reduce root knot nematode numbers. Annual crops that are useful in a rotation plan for reducing root knot nematode populations include small grains such as wheat and barley, sudangrass, and resistant tomato and bean varieties. Fallowing is the practice of leaving the soil bare for a period of time. Fallowing for 1 year will lower root knot nematode populations enough to successfully grow a susceptible annual crop. Two fallow years will lower nematode numbers even further. When fallowing, it is important to keep the soil moist to induce egg hatch and to control weeds on which nematodes can survive. As a result, eggs will hatch, but the nematodes will die if there is nothing to feed on. You will need to repeat fallowing when you begin to see root injury again, as nematodes can build up to damaging levels even in a single season. A good way to conduct a fallowing program is to split the garden into thirds and fallow one-third every year or two on a rotating basis. If you intend to grow woody plants in a nematode-infested area, consider fallowing the soil for 4 years before planting. Table 4 gives an example of a rotation/fallowing plan that would be useful for root knot nematode control.\tSoil Solarization\nTable 3.

However, solarization won’t provide long-term protection for fruit trees, vines, and woody ornamental plants. For effective solarization, moisten the soil, then cover it with a clear, plastic tarp. Leave the tarp in place for 4 to 6 weeks during the hottest part of summer. Root knot nematodes, including eggs, die when soil temperature exceeds 125°F for 30 minutes or 130°F for 5 minutes. The effectiveness of solarization is reduced in cool coastal areas, where summer temperatures commonly remain below 80°F. For a complete discussion of solarization, see Soil Solarization listed in References.\tPlanting and Harvesting Dates Most nematode species are active during warm summer months and can’t penetrate roots at soil temperatures below 64°F. Therefore, you can reduce nematode injury to fall-planted crops such as carrots, lettuce, spinach, and peas by waiting until soil temperatures have dropped below 64°F. Plant summer vegetables as early as possible in spring before nematodes become active. Plants with larger root systems, even though nematode-infested, might be able to remain productive longer. It is also helpful to remove annual vegetables, including their roots, as soon as harvest is over, to prevent nematodes from feeding and breeding on root systems. Nematode-suppressive Plants Certain marigolds, Tagetes species, suppress root knot and lesion nematodes. French marigolds (varieties include Nemagold, Petite Blanc, Queen Sophia, and Tangerine) are most effective. Avoid signet marigolds, T. signata or tenuifolia, because nematodes will feed and reproduce on these. Marigolds don’t work well against the northern root knot nematode, Meloidogyne hapla, a species common in areas with cool winters. The effect of marigolds is greatest when you grow them as a solid planting for an entire season. When grown along with annual vegetables or beneath trees or vines (intercropping), nematode control usually isn’t very good. To prevent marigold seed from getting in the soil, cut or mow the plants before the flowers open. As with other cultural control methods, nematode populations rapidly will increase as soon as you grow susceptible crops again. Soil Amendments and Irrigation You can add various organic amendments to the soil to reduce the effect of nematodes on crop plants. The amendments—which include peat, manure, and composts—are useful for increasing the water- and nutrient-holding capacity of the soil, especially sandy soils. Because nematodes more readily damage plants that are water-stressed, increasing the soil’s capacity to hold water can lessen the effects of nematode injury. Likewise, more frequent irrigation can help reduce nematode damage. In either case, you will have just as many nematodes in the soil, but they will cause less damage.\tPesticides\nTable 4.

    "damagePestNote": "Myoporum plants damaged by this thrips are characterized by gall-like distortion of new leaves. Terminal growth can be severely stunted, and leaf curling or folding is frequently found, with colonies of thrips within the folds. These thrips populations are difficult to reach with pesticides, making control difficult. When damage is persistent on terminal growth, death of well-established plants can occur. Research has shown that it requires only 4 hours for a single female thrips placed on terminal growth to cause significant growth distortion. Therefore, when considering control measures for sensitive and expensive plantings of Myoporum, preventive measures are most effective.",
    "managementPestNote": "Monitoring To monitor for myoporum thrips, examine plant terminal growth. It is especially important to perform an early-season search for females infesting the expanding leaf tissue, which can allow you to identify and treat infested plants before thrips become protected within leaf folds. A useful technique involves tapping the terminal shoots of the plant on white paper to see whether the insect falls out. Another monitoring technique is to collect terminal growth, place it into a jar with 70% alcohol (ethanol), and shake vigorously. This will dislodge the thrips. The solution can then be filtered through filter paper, and the thrips can easily be seen and counted. Cultural and Physical Controls The best way to prevent problems with myoporum thrips is to avoid planting susceptible species of Myoporum. The only two species that have been affected in California to date are Myoporum laetum and M. pacificum . Consider planting resistant Myoporum species or other landscape plants that do not have serious pest problems. On affected plants, infested terminal shoots may be pruned, bagged, and disposed of. Dying or dead plants should be disposed of in the same manner to prevent spread of the pest to other plants. Be aware that excessive pruning can stress, or even kill, both large and small Myoporum trees and shrubs. Biological control Minute pirate bugs (Orius spp.), green lacewings (Chrysopa and Chrysoperla spp.), and several species of predatory mites naturally help to control myoporum thrips. However, damage can still be severe even when beneficials are present. Chemical control Where infestations are severe on susceptible species, insecticide applications will be required to manage myoporum thrips. Because this thrips mostly lives protected within twisted terminal growth, it cannot be successfully managed with the reduced-risk and organic contact insecticides such as oils, soaps, and spinosad that control other species of thrips. Gardeners who do not want to use insecticides should replace affected myoporum plants with resistant plant species. The most effective products for myoporum thrips control are systemic insecticides that move throughout the plant, killing thrips within leaf galls and folds and preventing infestation of new growth. Effective systemic insecticides include the neonicotinoids thiamethoxam (for professional use only), dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and combination products that include one of these systemics plus bifenthrin, a pyrethroid insecticide with contact and residual activity. Any of the systemic materials listed above, or bifenthrin used alone, may also be effective as a preventive treatment if applied early in the season when new terminal growth is expanding. However, using bifenthrin or other pyrethroids will also kill beneficial organisms that may be assisting in control of this pest. Pyrethroid insecticides are very persistent in the environment; a lengthy period of time may be required before beneficials will reintroduce themselves into the system after an application. Systemics applied as drench or soil injections may be safer for natural enemies, but can have negative impacts on bees and other pollinators that visit treated plants. Always follow label instructions carefully. Systemics should never be used during the flowering period or when bees are present. Research has shown that applying dinotefuran to Myoporum tree trunks is very effective against this pest. However, products labeled for this use are only available to licensed pesticide applicators. This application method uses a small amount of pesticide solution that is applied in a narrow band around the tree trunk. The active ingredient penetrates the bark, and systemically moves throughout the tree, eventually reaching the new terminal growth. This method avoids soil drenching, spray drift, and contact with numerous beneficial predators and parasites. However, basal trunk applications may still impact pollinators if applied before or during bloom, as mentioned above.",

They are closely related to other sucking insects, such as stink bugs (family Pentatomidae) that can also suck juices from plants.",
    "damagePestNote": "Leaffooted bugs have piercing-sucking mouthparts that extend more than half of the length of the narrow body. They use this mouthpart to probe into leaves, shoots, and fruit to suck plant juices. The depth of the probing depends on the size of the bug: small nymphs feed shallowly on superficial plant juices, whereas adult bugs probe deep into fruit in search of seeds. If a hard seed is found, such as an almond kernel or juniper berry, the bug excretes digestive enzymes from its mouthparts to liquefy a small part of the seed so that it can be ingested. Leaffooted bug mouthparts are also known to carry a fungal yeast, Eremothecium coryli (formerly known as Nematospora). When leaffooted bugs feed, this yeast can be introduced into fruit causing a variety of symptoms usually related to discoloration. However, the yeast causes no damage that would limit the ability of the fruit to be harvested and consumed. This infection is most predominant when rains are abundant. For most ornamental and many garden plants, feeding on the leaves and shoots causes no visual damage and is of little concern. The most destructive damage occurs when bugs feed on fruit. Early-season feeding on nuts like almonds and pistachios can cause the kernel to abort and die, and mid- to late-season feeding on nuts causes a black stain on the kernel. On pomegranates, late-season feeding as the fruit ripens generally causes no external damage but can cause aryls (seed-like structures) to darken and wither, especially if fungal spores gain entry into the fruit through the feeding wound. Large aggregations of leaffooted bugs can also leave excrement on the surface of the fruit that can reduce its aesthetic appeal. Feeding on small fruit (e.g., tomatoes) can cause the fruit to abort, while feeding on medium-sized fruit can result in depressions or discoloration at the feeding site as the fruit expands and ripens. Feeding on mature tomatoes can cause slight discoloration to the surface of the fruit that should be of no concern to backyard gardeners.",
    "managementPestNote": "During most years, leaffooted bug populations are low enough that damage to gardens is tolerable and damage to landscape plants is negligible. When outbreaks occur, a variety of methods will likely be needed to manage this pest, which may include removing overwintering sites or the use of weed host removal, row covers, physical removal, natural enemies, and insecticides. Achieving good control will likely require some combination of these methods. Remove Overwintering Sites Adult bugs overwinter in woodpiles, under the bark of eucalyptus, juniper, or cypress, and in outbuildings. Large numbers may pass the winter in culls of fruit such as pomegranates. Remove these overwintering sites where possible or inspect them for leaffooted bugs. Weed Removal Weedy areas serve as a food source for leaffooted bugs during winter and spring, when fruits are not available. Try to eliminate such areas near your garden or keep weedy areas closely mowed. Row Covers Covering plants with a row cover material can prevent feeding by leaffooted bugs. A row cover is a light, permeable material, usually made of polypropylene or polyester. Row covers are sometimes used to extend the harvest season past the first few frosts but are also valuable for preventing damage by a wide range of pests. Covers must be applied early, before bugs arrive and lay eggs on plants; otherwise, bugs will be trapped inside. Unfortunately, row covers will prevent pollinators and beneficial insects from reaching plants. Some garden plants like tomatoes are self-pollinating, but whiteflies or aphids may build up if beneficial insects are excluded. Physical Removal Thoroughly examine plants for all stages of the pest, daily to several times per week. The bugs may be hidden inside dense foliage layers or fruit clusters, and they may hide or fly when startled. Handpick and crush the bugs or brush them off plants into soapy water. Wear gloves because of the odor they will emit when handled. A handheld vacuum dedicated to catching the bugs can be effective at reducing numbers, if used regularly. It is especially important to remove the bugs as early in the season as possible, when the very young nymphs are tightly clustered together, and morning is best to reduce movement and flight. Be sure to also destroy the egg masses found on the underside of leaves. For late-season infestations in pomegranate trees, prune trees so that there is a space between tree limbs and the ground. Leaffooted bug nymphs can easily be knocked out of the tree using a stick, by physically shaking the tree limbs, or using water from a pressure nozzle on a garden hose. Once bugs fall on the ground, they can be smashed. This method is effective against nymphs but will not dislodge eggs. It is less effective against adults, which are able to fly away. For this reason, this method should be repeated once every 1 to 2 weeks as necessary, until the majority of the bugs have disappeared. Laying a white ground cover beneath the plant can aid in seeing the insects when using this control method. Natural Enemies Native egg parasites, such as the tiny wasp, Gryon pennsylvanicum, if not disrupted, may reduce leaffooted bug populations by killing the eggs before they hatch. Adult leaffooted bugs may be parasitized by certain tachinid flies, such as Trichopoda pennipes, which lays its eggs on the sides of large nymphs or adults of several species of true bugs. Leaffooted bug predators include birds, spiders, and assassin bugs. Although they may control only a small number of the bugs, natural enemies are important to preserve because they control other pests as well. Avoiding use of persistent broad-spectrum insecticides and assuring pollen and nectar sources for adult beneficials are important ways to protect natural enemies. Insecticides Insecticides are rarely needed for leaffooted bug control because small blemishes on most fruit are tolerable in gardening situations and because landscape plants are rarely damaged. Also, because they are primarily seed feeders, leaffooted bugs are most common on garden plants near harvest, when the application of pesticides to fruits that are going to be consumed is undesirable. In addition, most insecticides available to homeowners only have temporary effects on the leaffooted bug. However, in severe cases, insecticides can be considered as a last resort. If needed, insecticides will be most effective against small nymphs. Therefore, monitor infested plants for egg masses and try to make insecticide applications when small nymphs are present. The most effective insecticides against leaffooted bug are broad-spectrum, pyrethroid-based insecticides, such as permethrin. However, these products are quite toxic to bees and beneficial insects. Insecticidal soap or botanicals, such as neem oil or pyrethrin, may provide some control of young nymphs only. If insecticides are used close to harvest, make sure to observe the days-to-harvest period indicated on the insecticide label; and wash the fruit before eating.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Insects are not a common cause of residential lawn damage in California, but certain species may occasionally damage or kill turfgrass. Insect feeding can cause grass to turn yellow or brown or die, especially if the grass is already stressed. Damage usually begins in small, scattered patches, which may merge into large dead areas. However, lack of proper cultural care and use of inappropriate grass species in a particular location are much more likely to cause unhealthy or dying lawns than insects. Vertebrate predators such as skunks, raccoons, wild pigs, and birds may be attracted to turf infested by insects, especially white grubs in autumn, and cause further damage by uprooting grass in search of their prey. For more information about these pests see the vertebrate pests section of the UC IPM Home and Landscape web site. Disease-causing pathogens, excessive or inappropriate use of chemicals such as fertilizers and herbicides, and dog urine also produce damage resembling that of insects. Before taking any insect control action, be certain insects are causing the damage and not something else and that the insect pest is present in life stages susceptible to control actions.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Contrary to popular belief, insects are not a common cause of lawn damage in California. Poor lawn care, especially incorrect watering or planting grass varieties not suited to your area, is the most likely cause of unhealthy or dying lawns. Turfgrass diseases and dog urine also produce similar damage. Never apply an insecticide unless a damaging level of a known insect is confirmed. Insecticides are only effective if applied at the right time and in the right manner. Many insecticides also kill good bugs—use them only as a last resort. Keep your lawn healthy. Plant grass species best suited for your area. Over-seed thin areas in the spring and fall. Water deeply and infrequently. Perform routine maintenance on sprinkler heads. Apply fertilizer appropriately. Aerate your lawn annually; remove thatch if it exceeds 1/2 inch. Cut only 1/3 of grass height at each mowing and keep lawnmower blades sharp. How do you know if insects are causing damage? Brown spots in lawns can have different causes. Over- or under-watering, plant disease, over-application of fertilizer/herbicide or chemical spill, and dog urine all cause similar looking damage. Before applying an insecticide, confirm that insects are present at high enough numbers to cause damage. For grubs, dig around roots. You do not need to treat if there are 5 or fewer grubs per square foot. For other insects, perform a drench test (described on reverse). If you do not find live pest insects at high levels, do not treat with pesticides. What about pesticides? Before applying insecticide, try to alter your lawn environment to discourage the pest. If an insecticide is required, select the least toxic product available for the pest you are targeting. Time treatments appropriately to be effective. Insect-attacking nematodes control caterpillars or grubs. Find out which insecticide targets your pest: Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and spinosad are least toxic pesticides that kill caterpillars. Azadirachtin controls cutworms, armyworms, and larvae of lawn moths. Imidacloprid controls young lawn grubs but can injure bees on flowering weeds and earthworms. Avoid products containing carbaryl and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin). These are broadly toxic insecticides that kill chinch bugs, grubs, lawn moths, and cutworms, but also kill beneficial insects and pollute waterways. How to perform a drench test: Measure out an area of lawn that equals 1 square yard. Mix 3–4 tablespoons of dishwashing liquid to 2 gallons of water. Evenly apply the 2 gallons to 1 square yard of your lawn. Watch the area for 10 minutes and count the number of caterpillars that rise to the surface. Treat the area only if insect numbers exceed 5 armyworms or cutworms or 15 lawn moth larvae per square yard. ",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Over a dozen species of lace bugs (family Tingidae) occur in California. Each feed on one or a few closely related plant species. Hosts include alder, ash, avocado, coyote brush, birch, ceanothus, photinia, poplar, sycamore, toyon, and willow.",
    "life_cycle": "Over a dozen species of lace bugs (family Tingidae) occur in California. Each feed on one or a few closely related plant species. Hosts include alder, ash, avocado, coyote brush, birch, ceanothus, photinia, poplar, sycamore, toyon, and willow.",
    "damagePestNote": "Lace bug adults and nymphs feed on the underside of leaves by sucking fluids from plants' photosynthetic tissues. This causes pale stippling and bleaching that can become very obvious on the upper leaf surface by mid to late summer. Adults and nymphs also foul leaves with specks of dark, varnishlike excrement ; and this excrement sometimes drips onto pavement and other surfaces beneath infested plants. Certain other true bugs and thrips also produce leaf stippling and dark excrement. Mites also stipple leaves. Mite infestations usually can be distinguished by the absence of dark excrement and sometimes by the presence of mite cast skins and fine silken webbing. Examine the lower leaf surface, using a magnifying lens if necessary, to identify what type of pest is causing the damage. Lace bug feeding is not a serious threat to plant health or survival. Prolonged high populations of lace bugs may cause premature drop of some leaves and a modest reduction in plant growth rate. On avocado premature leaf drop may lead to sunburn of some fruit and a subsequent reduction in fruit yield.",
    "managementPestNote": "Tolerate lace bug damage where possible. The injury is mostly aesthetic (cosmetic) and does not seriously harm plants. Provide proper cultural care so plants are vigorous. Conserve predators and parasites and apply cultural controls as discussed below to help suppress populations of at least some species of lace bugs. No treatment will restore stippled foliage, which remains until pruned off or replaced by new growth. If intolerable damage has occurred, during subsequent years inspect plants about once a week beginning in late winter. Take action when lace bug nymphs become abundant and before damage becomes extensive. A forceful stream of water directed at the underside of leaves beginning early in the season, when nymphs are the predominant life stage, and repeated at intervals can help to suppress, where feasible, lace bug populations on small shrubs. Various insecticides are available for use on landscape plants, but these products can adversely affect beneficial invertebrates and the environment. Cultural Control Grow plants that are well adapted to conditions at the site. Consider replacing plants that perform poorly or repeatedly experience unacceptable pest damage. Certain plant species growing in hot, sunny locations are more likely to be damaged by lace bugs. For example, azalea and toyon grown under partial shade experience less damage by lace bugs than when they are grown in locations more exposed to direct sunlight and higher temperatures. Provide adequate irrigation and otherwise provide plants with appropriate care. On toyon and possibly other shrubs, lace bug survival during winter and subsequent damage in spring may be reduced by keeping soil beneath host plants bare during December through February, by shallowly cultivating the soil surface several times during this period, or using both practices. For example, during late fall rake away and compost leaves beneath lace bug host plants. If organic mulch is reapplied in spring, avoid using leaves from the same plant genus as mulch near that plant because it may harbor adult lace bugs. Biological Control Natural enemies of lace bugs include parasitic wasps, predatory assassin bugs, lacewing larvae, lady beetles, jumping spiders, pirate bugs, and mites. These beneficial species may not appear in sufficient numbers until after lace bugs become abundant, but their preservation is an essential part of a long-term, integrated pest management program. To increase natural enemy abundance and reduce lace bug damage, grow a variety of flowering plant species and provide partial shade to shrub species that are not adapted to grow in full sun. If applying pesticides, choose nonpersistent, contact insecticides to minimize the adverse effects on beneficial predators and parasites. Chemical Control Insecticides will not restore an undamaged appearance, but can reduce or prevent further damage. Apply insecticide only when pests are present or expected to become too abundant. Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water, poisoning natural enemies and pollinators, and causing secondary pest outbreaks. Completely read and follow the product label instructions for the safe and effective use of that insecticide. Nonresidual, Contact Insecticides When properly applied, almost any contact insecticide will control lace bugs. Contact insecticides that do not leave persistent, toxic residues include azadirachtin (Safer BioNeem), insecticidal soap (Safer), narrow-range oil (Monterey Horticultural Oil, Volck), neem oil (Green Light, Garden Safe), and pyrethrin products, which are often combined with the synergist piperonyl butoxide (Ace Flower & Vegetable Insect Spray, Garden Tech Worry Free Brand Concentrate). These insecticides have low toxicity to people and pets and relatively little adverse impact on the populations of pollinators and natural enemies and the benefits they provide. To obtain adequate control, thoroughly wet the underside of infested leaves with spray beginning in spring when lace bug nymphs become abundant. To provide adequate control, application may need to be repeated. Systemic Insecticides Systemic insecticides are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., trunks or roots) and moved (translocated) to leaves or other plant parts. In comparison with systemics that are sprayed onto foliage, products labeled for soil drench or injection or for trunk injection or spraying minimize environmental contamination and may be more effective. Trunk application of systemic insecticides can provide relatively rapid control. There is a longer time delay between soil application and insecticide action. Some uses require hiring a professional pesticide applicator. Certain home-use products can easily be drenched into soil around the tree trunk using the mix-and-pour method. Systemic insecticides available for use against lace bugs include the neonicotinoids dinotefuran (Safari) and imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Merit) and the organophosphate acephate (Lilly Miller Ready-to-Use Systemic, Orthene). When properly applied, one application may provide season long control. Some systemic insecticides can cause spider mite outbreaks and are toxic to beneficial insects that are directly sprayed or come into contact with treated leaves. Systemics can translocate into flowers and have adverse effects on natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. Do not apply systemic insecticides to plants during flowering or shortly before flowering; wait until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering unless the product's label directions say otherwise. With soil application, when possible, wait until nearby plants also have completed flowering, as their roots may take up some of the soil-applied insecticide. If applying systemic insecticide, use soil application or a trunk spray whenever possible. With trunk injection and implantation, it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. These methods also injure woody plants and can spread plant pathogens on contaminated tools. When injecting or implanting into multiple plants, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate bark and disinfect tools with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach) before moving to work on each new plant. At least 1 to 2 minutes of disinfectant contact time between contaminated uses is generally required. Consider rotating work among several tools, using a freshly disinfected tool while the most recently used tools are being soaked in disinfectant. Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject into roots or trunks more than once a year. Residual, Foliar Sprays Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides with residues that can persist for weeks are not recommended for lace bug control. Pesticides to avoid include carbamates (carbaryl or Sevin), nonsystemic organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fluvalinate, permethrin). These are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause outbreaks of spider mites or other pests. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Walking stick insects, order Phasmatodea, are mostly tropical insects that are considered an entomological curiosity because of their remarkable mimicry of twigs and leaves. Several species are popular in the pet trade and for grade school demonstrations and thus get moved extensively with some, such as the Indian walking stick insect, Carausius morosus, becoming established in many parts of the world. The Indian walking stick is native to southern India, but the precise time of its establishment in California is unknown; the first official finding occurred in San Diego County in 1991 and shortly thereafter in San Luis Obispo County. There has been an increase in homeowner reports of walking stick damage in the last 10 years along the Central and Southern coasts of the state. The establishment of Indian walking sticks in California landscapes has occurred as a result of their escape from captivity or through discarding of eggs. Indian walking stick insects produce viable eggs without mating and broadcast them in their cages or containers; the eggs become co-mingled with their droppings (frass). The eggs are difficult to distinguish from frass and are easily tossed out in the process of cleaning the cage. Owners of walking stick pets must be responsible for understanding the biology of these organisms and caring for them properly, which includes bagging the cage debris and disposing of it in the trash. The adult Indian walking stick is 2 3/4 to 4 inches long, wingless, and usually brownish with a long, thin body and legs (Figure 1). It can retract its legs seamlessly alongside its body, enhancing the insect’s sticklike appearance; the forelegs project forward adding to the overall length of the insect. Eggs of Indian walking sticks look like seeds. They are ovoid, grayish-brown with a small, buff-colored cap (operculum) on one end through which the young insect emerges (Figure 2). The eggs are similar in size to the frass these insects produce, but the frass is rough in texture. There are five nymphal instars, each instar progressively larger with each molt. Nymphs are similarly colored to the eventual adult, and it is difficult to distinguish larger nymphs from adults. A few walking stick species are native to California including the western shorthorned walking stick, Parabacillus hesperus, the gray walking stick, Pseudosermyle straminea, and species in the genus Timema. All of these species feed primarily on grasses and scrub brush—mostly woody shrubs—in dry wild areas and haven’t been reported as pests in landscapes. Adult females of the Indian walking stick can be readily distinguished from these species by the red markings at the base of their front legs (Figure 3).",
    "life_cycle": "Adult females can live for several months and produce several hundred eggs during their lifetime. Eggs hatch in 10 to 12 weeks at room temperature. The five nymphal instars take 4 to 6 weeks to complete before the insect reaches adulthood. No rigorous studies of temperature-dependent developmental durations or reproduction have been published for this species. Most knowledge has been gained from their use in the pet trade. Indian walking sticks feed on a wide variety of plant species in California including but not limited to azalea, bramble, camellia, geranium, hawthorn, hibiscus, ivy, jasmine, oak, privet, pyracantha, rose, and some common garden vegetables. Indian walking sticks reproduce mainly asexually (parthenogenetically), with females haphazardly dropping eggs while they feed or rest. Males are known but are rare; nothing is known regarding the conditions required to produce them. Females frequently feed and move through foliage at night but also can be observed feeding throughout the day. The conditions along the coast of California are mild enough for these tropical species to survive through the winter, although they do so mainly in the egg stage. Thus, most observations of activity and damage take place during the spring when nymphal stages emerge from over-wintered eggs and begin feeding. Multiple generations occur through the summer with nymphs and adults observed well into November or until the first frost. Stick insects exhibit crypsis, a combination of color, shape, and behavior that makes them blend into the environment, thus avoiding detection by predators. When stick insects move through the foliage, they typically do so very slowly and with swaying movements that mimic the effects of wind on the plant. When disturbed, the insect retracts its legs and remains perfectly still, even when handled. Only when aggressively handled will the insects display yet another color phenomenon—aposematic, or warning, coloration. If the insect is in danger of being harmed it will splay its forelegs to reveal a bright red patch on its inner femora near the attachment point to the body (Figure 3). This color can startle predators, giving the insect a chance to escape. When a stick insect isn’t on a feeding site, such as walking on bare ground or poised on a man-made structure, they become easily evident,  and due to their large size, can be alarming to some people. Indian walking stick egg survival hasn’t been studied in California. The eggs in their native home are attractive to grain-feeding ants that mistake them for seeds and cart them back to their nests but never feed on them. Since the eggs are broadcast into the environment, the ants play a role in the egg’s survival by bringing them into the nest, where they remain undisturbed until hatching.",
    "damagePestNote": "The worst damage typically is recorded in the springtime when nymphs are hatching from eggs and feeding on new flush growth of many plants species in landscape settings. They feed aggressively on small-leafed varieties of ivy and privet. Nymphs and adults feed heavily on the margins of mature leaves, creating a tattered appearance, or fully consume smaller, tender leaves (Figure 4). Populations develop unnoticed until significant feeding takes place. Damage reports in landscapes have been spotty and inconsistent from year to year on the Southern and Central coasts of California. The most frequent complaints arise from residents when they encounter walking sticks on windows, doors, or even inside homes on warm summer nights. Don’t release Indian walking sticks or other exotic insects into landscapes or wild areas. If you are keeping these species as pets, when cleaning the cage put the debris into a bag and close the bag securely before throwing it in the trash. Do not toss loose debris outside, as it might contain eggs or the insects. If you no longer care to raise Indian walking sticks, place the entire contents of the cage including live insects and all debris into a plastic bag, tie the bag securely and place it in a freezer for at least 48 hours before throwing it in the trash. No biological agents have been released for their control, and it is assumed that generalist predators feed upon them when encountered; no definitive studies have been conducted. Removing and destroying the insects can reduce populations over time and reduce evidence of feeding; however, finding them is difficult due to their cryptic nature. There is no research on pesticide efficacy against walking sticks. Pesticide applications aren’t recommended at this time, as they might kill beneficial insects occurring in the landscape. Care must be taken when using insecticides, especially when applications are made to edible plants.",
    "managementPestNote": "Indian walking sticks usually are mostly a nuisance in the landscape, although in some years and in some locations they can seriously defoliate plants and cause damage to valued specimens.",

Furthermore, the worms can be beneficial, because they will parasitize a few pest insect species, although their effect on natural invertebrate populations is minimal. If the worms are found in livestock water troughs, the water can be kept clean with routine flushing. Use a fine mesh filter if pumping water from a surface supply such as a canal or pond. If the worms occur in swimming pools, they can be removed by hand or with a net. Domestic water supply systems should be filtered, chemically treated, and inspected for necessary repairs, especially when the homeowner discovers horsehair worms in wash water, bathtubs, or sinks. Moreover, it isn't unusual to find horsehair worms in the home in such places as shower stalls or toilets where crickets may die and worms emerge into the water. Prevent nuisance insects such as crickets, which are known hosts, from entering the home by caulking or sealing entryways.",

Because it has just one generation a year, it is a problem only from late March to May when the adult beetles feed on light-colored blossoms.",
    "damagePestNote": "Hoplia beetle adults are especially attracted to light-colored flowers and chew round holes in the petals of white, yellow, apricot, and pink roses. Their chewing can destroy a rose’s early buds and flowers, but the beetles don’t feed on the leaves. Hoplia beetles also feed on the flowers of calla, citrus, irises, lilies, magnolia, olive, peonies, poppies, and strawberries and on the young leaves and fruit of almonds, grapes, and peaches.",
    "managementPestNote": "One way to manage hoplia beetles in your garden is to regularly handpick them off the flowers they are feeding on and dispose of them in a bucket of soapy water, or shake them out of the blooms directly into the soapy water. You also can just clip off blooms infested with beetles and dispose of them. Regular handpicking can be an important way of reducing future beetle populations in the immediate area. Another nonchemical control measure is to fill white, 5-gallon buckets with water and a few drops of detergent to break the surface tension. Place these buckets in several locations throughout the rose garden; they’ll attract the beetles, which fall in the buckets and drown. The effectiveness of this method hasn’t been tested by research, and like handpicking, it might serve only to reduce the beetle population somewhat. When planting roses in an area where these beetles are plentiful, consider choosing darker-colored varieties such as red roses to help avoid problems with this pest. Sprays generally aren’t recommended. It’s very difficult to obtain effective control with insecticides, because the blossoms protect the beetles and the spray must come in direct contact with the beetles in order for it to kill them. Chemical control of the larvae in most cases isn’t possible, because they can live in the soil outside the garden or in surrounding landscapes. Systemic insecticides aren’t effective against the adults, because concentrations high enough to be toxic don’t occur in the blossoms where they feed. If chewing damage can’t be tolerated for the 2- to 4-week period the beetles are present, an insecticide such as carbaryl (Sevin), malathion, or the pyrethroid cyfluthrin can be applied. These insecticides kill only those beetles present at the time of the spray applications. Don’t spray blooming plants where honey bees are present, because most insecticides are very toxic to them. Avoid using these insecticides when possible. They are harmful to natural enemies, and some materials have been found in urban surface water systems at levels that warrant concern.",

    "damagePestNote": "This aphid is a pest because it produces copious honeydew excretions upon which blackish sooty mold grows creating a sticky mess on leaves and surfaces beneath infested trees. However, no long-term or serious damage to hackberry trees has been found after years of aphid infestations. Insecticides apparently are not warranted to protect the health or survival of infested trees but are applied when honeydew excretions are intolerable to people.",
    "managementPestNote": "Inspect leaves for waxy masses and insects to be sure that aphids are the cause of annoying honeydew. Citricola scale, described above, also produces honeydew and is easily overlooked. Because plant health apparently is not threatened, apply insecticide only where annoyance from honeydew cannot be tolerated. Honeydew Monitoring Water-sensitive cards can be used by landscape managers to efficiently monitor honeydew dripping from trees. This technique provides a consistent measure of changes in aphid abundance and helps you decide when to take control action and afterwards to evaluate the effectiveness of your actions. The effort required to monitor honeydew can be warranted on tall trees where the honeydew-producing insects may be located too high to easily observe, where there is a low tolerance for dripping honeydew, and when managing many trees, such as along city streets and parking lots. Monitor honeydew with the bright yellow cards sold for evaluating insecticide spray coverage and calibrating sprayers. Cards develop distinct blue dots upon contact with honeydew or water droplets. These droplet monitoring cards generally must be mail ordered and are different from the yellow sticky traps used to monitor winged insects. Regularly monitor honeydew beneath plants, such as the number of drops during four hours on the same time of day once a week. Label and save the cards from each monitoring date, and visually compare the cards among sample dates. For more information on monitoring honeydew, see Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs: An Integrated Pest Management Guide. Cultural Control Provide trees with appropriate soil moisture, avoid compacting topsoil, and prevent prolonged waterlogging of soil near trunks. Excess irrigation promotes certain root decay pathogens and may contribute to a malady of undetermined cause that has killed many Chinese hackberry in some locations in California. Avoid fertilizing hackberry unless nutrient deficiency has definitely been diagnosed. Excess nitrogen has been shown to increase aphid numbers on certain other plant species. A forceful stream of water will dislodge and kill some aphids and wash away honeydew on plants small enough for hosing to be practical. Biological Control The convergent lady beetle, multicolored Asian lady beetle, syrphid flies, and lacewing larvae are common aphid predators. No parasitic wasps or other natural enemies specific to this pest species have been reported in California. Several parasitic wasps of the Trioxys species attack this aphid in Asia, and the introduction of these natural enemies is one long-term possibility for managing this pest. In many California situations, natural enemies do not provide adequate biological control of this aphid. Nevertheless, avoid spraying hackberry with broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides that kill natural enemies; because the citricola scale, another major hackberry pest, is well controlled by parasites in some locations. Chemical Control Before applying insecticide, make sure plants are receiving appropriate cultural care and take steps to conserve natural enemies. Completely read and follow the product label instructions for the safe and effective use of the insecticide. Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water, poisoning pollinators and natural enemies, and causing secondary pest outbreaks. Nonresidual, Contact Insecticides Where trees can be sprayed, completely covering shoot terminals and the undersides of leaves with a nonpersistent, contact insecticide can provide partial control of hackberry aphids. Available nonpersistent, contact insecticides include narrow-range or horticultural oils (e.g., Bonide Horticultural Oil), insecticidal soap (Safer Brand Insect Killing Soap Concentrate II), and pyrethrin products, which are often combined with piperonyl butoxide (Ace Flower & Vegetable Insect Spray, Garden Tech Worry Free Brand Concentrate). These insecticides have low toxicity to people and pets and relatively little adverse impact on the populations of pollinators and natural enemies and the benefits they provide. These products will give only partial control because aphids’ woolly wax protects them from sprays; and it is difficult to obtain thorough spray coverage of aphids, especially on large trees. Because these insecticides provide no residual control and aphids have several generations each year, more than one application per season is generally needed. Dormant Spray Thorough application of horticultural oil (sometimes also called supreme, superior, or narrow-range oil) to twig terminals during the dormant or delayed dormant season (after buds swell, but before leaves open) can kill overwintering eggs on twigs. Delayed dormant spraying is unlikely to give complete control of aphids and will not control aphids that fly in from other hackberry trees after leaves have opened. However, dormant oil spray provides good control of citricola scale, and aphid reduction could be a side benefit if treatment is needed for scales. Systemic Insecticides Systemic insecticides are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., trunks or roots) and moved (translocated) to leaves or other plant parts. In comparison with systemics that are sprayed onto foliage, products labeled for soil drench or injection or for trunk injection or spraying minimize environmental contamination and may be more effective. Trunk application of systemic insecticides can provide relatively rapid control. There is a longer time delay between soil application and insecticide action. Properly applied, one application can provide effective control for the entire growing season. If applying systemic insecticide, use soil drench or injection or a trunk spray whenever possible. Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides for use on landscape plants include imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced 12 Month Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Bonide Annual Tree & Shrub Insect Control Concentrate), which can easily be drenched into soil around the tree trunk using the mix-and-pour method as directed on the product labels. The neonicotinoid dinotefuran is also available for aphid control by home users (Green Light Tree & Shrub Insect Control with Safari 2G and Ortho Tree & Shrub Insect Control Granules). Dinotefuran (Safari) and imidacloprid (Merit) are also available to professional applicators. Late winter is an effective time to apply imidacloprid. However, this is before you can know whether aphids will become abundant enough to warrant the application. Spring and summer application of a neonicotinoid can be effective on trees that receive regular irrigation, such as those growing in lawns. Delaying the application and monitoring regularly allows you to limit insecticide use to situations where aphids or their honeydew are becoming too abundant. No treatments should be conducted during the fall, because hackberry leaves will soon drop naturally. Systemic insecticides can cause spider mite outbreaks and foliage sprays of them can be toxic to beneficial insects that contact spray or treated leaves. Systemics can translocate into flowers and have adverse effects on natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. Although hackberry’s tiny flowers are wind pollinated, do not apply systemic insecticides to plants during flowering or shortly before flowering; wait until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering unless the product’s label directions say otherwise. With soil application, when possible, wait until nearby plants also have completed flowering, as their roots may take up some of the soil-applied insecticide. Injection and Implantation Avoid injecting or implanting pesticides or other materials into hackberry trunks or roots. With trunk injection and implantation, it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. These methods also injure woody plants and can spread plant pathogens on contaminated tools. Chinese hackberry are susceptible to an unexplained, tree-killing malady, which may be a vascular wilt pathogen that could be mechanically spread by unsterilized tools that contact internal parts of multiple hackberry trees. It would be unfortunate if implants or injections to provide short-term control of an aesthetic or annoying honeydew problem killed trees by spreading the undiagnosed malady. When injecting or implanting into multiple plants, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate bark and disinfect tools with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach) before moving to work on each new plant. At least 1 to 2 minutes of disinfectant contact time between contaminated uses is generally required. Consider rotating work among several tools, using a freshly disinfected tool while the most recently used tools are being soaked in disinfectant. Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject into roots or trunks more than once a year. Residual, Foliar Sprays Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides with residues that can persist for weeks are not recommended for aphid control in landscapes and gardens. Pesticides to avoid include carbamates (carbaryl or Sevin), organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (bifenthrin, fluvalinate, permethrin). These are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause outbreaks of spider mites or other pests. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Grasshoppers are sporadic pests in gardens. However, in some years large populations may build up in foothills and rangelands, especially after a wet spring, and then migrate into nearby gardens, often defoliating everything in sight. More than 200 species of grasshoppers occur in California, but only a few of these cause significant problems in gardens. The devastating grasshopper, Melanoplus devastator, and the valley grasshopper, Oedaleonotus enigma, are the most widespread and destructive. Identification and Life Cycle Grasshoppers are readily distinguished from most other insects. Their hind legs, with greatly enlarged femurs, are well adapted for jumping. Their body is robust, and their antennae are relatively short. In contrast, two other common garden pests in the order Orthoptera, crickets and katydids, have long antennae. Most grasshoppers are winged and many are good flyers, although a few species are flightless. In late summer and in fall, adult female grasshoppers deposit their eggs in soil in undisturbed areas such as grassy foothills, ditch banks, roadsides, fencerows, pasture areas, and alfalfa fields. Cultivated gardens don’t seem to be a common site for egg laying. Eggs are laid in the upper 2 inches of soil in elongated pods that contain 20 to more than 100 eggs. When soil temperatures warm in spring, the eggs hatch and the young nymphs begin to feed on nearby plants. Nymphs readily move to new locations when food supplies disappear. Most species molt five to six times before becoming adults and usually have only one generation a year. Adult grasshoppers can live two to three months; they die out when food becomes scarce or when the weather becomes too cold. Many predators eat grasshoppers, including birds, blister beetles (which feed on eggs), and robber flies. Fungal and bacterial diseases as well as parasites also kill grasshoppers. Grasshopper population sizes vary from year to year, and severe outbreaks normally occur only every 8 to 10 years. Some outbreaks last two or three years. If favorable conditions—such as warm, moist springs that produce a lot of food in the foothills and uncultivated areas—persist for several years, populations may build to high levels. Major migrations, which cause the most damage, occur when populations are high and forage becomes depleted. Nymphs typically move downhill toward green vegetation. Adults may fly 15 or more miles a day in large swarms during migrations. Damage Most grasshoppers are general feeders, but they prefer young green plants, especially lettuce, beans, corn, carrots, onions, and some annual flowers. Squash and tomatoes are among the vegetables grasshoppers least favor. Grasshoppers have chewing mouthparts that remove large sections of leaves and flowers, sometimes devouring entire plants. Garden damage is usually limited to a few weeks in early summer immediately after range weeds dry up. However, during major outbreaks grasshoppers will feed on almost any green plant, and damage may occur over a considerably longer period. Management Grasshoppers are among the most difficult insect pests to manage in the garden. When numbers are low, they can be handpicked and squashed. Cones, screened boxes, floating row covers, and other protective covers provide some protection if the number of pests isn't high. However, if they are hungry enough, grasshoppers will eat through cloth or plastic row covers, so try using metal window screening. Poultry, including chickens and guinea hens, are excellent predators but can also cause damage to some garden plants. One strategy that can be used in gardens where migration of grasshoppers frequently occurs is to keep an attractive green border of tall grass or lush green plants around the perimeter of the garden to trap insects and divert them from vegetables or flowers. Don't mow this trap crop or let it dry out, or you will send the grasshoppers straight into the garden. During years when huge numbers of grasshoppers are migrating, there is almost nothing you can do to protect plants once the invasion has reached the garden. The best strategy in agricultural and rangeland areas during major migrations is to treat the grasshoppers with an insecticide early in the season when they are still young nymphs living in uncultivated areas. Usually gardeners don't have control over these areas, so management options are few. Gardeners can apply a bait containing carbaryl around the borders of their garden before grasshoppers arrive. If a grasshopper trap crop is being grown around the border of the garden, these plants can be baited or sprayed with carbaryl or other products to kill grasshoppers. These insecticides have only a few days of residual activity against grasshoppers, and because baits lose their effectiveness after rain or irrigation, they will need to be reapplied if migrations continue. Small grasshopper nymphs are easier to control with insecticides than larger ones, and adults are very difficult to control. Baits containing the protozoan Nosema locustae are used in some western states to kill nymphs of migrating grasshoppers in uncultivated breeding areas early in the season. Unfortunately Nosema baits are very slow-acting and only affect nymphs of certain grasshopper species, so this management technique isn't likely to be effective in California home garden situations. Once grasshoppers have invaded the garden, insecticides won't be very effective and must be reapplied every few days as long as the invasion continues; read the product label to determine the allowable frequency of applications. Carbaryl and other insecticides such as cyfluthrin or other pyrethroids commonly used as sprays for grasshopper control are very toxic to bees, natural enemies of grasshoppers, and aquatic life, although carbaryl in bait form is less hazardous to bees. Reserve the use of insecticides for serious situations where they may provide a significant level of control, ideally as baits around the edge of the garden before grasshoppers invade.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The goldspotted oak borer (GSOB), Agrilus auroguttatus (Coleoptera: Buprestidae), is a flatheaded borer introduced to San Diego County, California, in the late 1990s or early 2000s and also detected at one site in Riverside County in 2012. It was likely brought into the state on oak firewood collected and transported from the insect’s native range in southeastern Arizona or northern Mexico. Although currently confined to San Diego and Riverside counties, this pest will likely invade other areas of California. Since at least 2000, GSOB has caused extensive injury and mortality to oaks in woodlands and mixed-conifer forests in San Diego County. GSOB prefers mature oak trees, but it occasionally attacks smaller oaks with a diameter at breast height (dbh) of about 10 inches. It has rarely been recorded in oaks with a dbh of less than 5 inches. Trees with a dbh of 18 inches or greater are the most likely to be killed. GSOB attacks only oaks and prefers those in the red oak group including coast live oak, Quercus agrifolia, and California black oak, Q. kelloggii. GSOB also infests canyon live oak, Q. chrysolepis, and on very rare occasions Engelmann oak, Q. engelmannii . Red oaks are a common component of forests throughout California, and species in this group are at risk throughout the state if GSOB spreads by adult flight dispersal or via human-assisted transport (e.g., in firewood) from its current locations. Typical damage associated with GSOB-infested trees includes crown thinning and dieback, bark staining on the main stem, bark injury from woodpecker foraging, and D-shaped emergence holes on the main stem and larger branches of the tree. Following several years of extensive and repeated bouts of injury from larval feeding, tree health declines, and trees eventually die.",

Following several years of extensive and repeated bouts of injury from larval feeding, tree health declines, and trees eventually die.",
    "damagePestNote": "Larval feeding by GSOB causes the most significant damage to host oaks. Extensive feeding from numerous attacks girdles trees, disrupting water and nutrient uptake and eventually causing the tree to die. Removing bark from heavily infested trees reveals meandering larval galleries tightly packed with dark-colored boring dust and insect excrement (frass). Pockets of sap may accumulate beneath the bark around the galleries, and trees form callus tissue in the phloem and xylem in response to the injury. Although adults feed on the foliage, this feeding doesn’t contribute to the decline of the tree. Larval feeding weakens trees, causing signs of decline that include crown thinning and dieback, which are similar to decline resulting from other causes. However, GSOB-injured trees can be distinguished by the presence of D-shaped adult emergence holes, about 4 millimeters wide, which extend through the bark surface on the trunk of the tree or larger branches. These emergence holes are found predominately in the lower 10 feet of the trunk to the root collar and can be clustered or randomly spaced on the main stem. Heavily infested trees can have more than 100 highly visible emergence holes. Woodpeckers remove pieces of the outer bark when they forage for GSOB larvae and pupae along the main stem and larger branches, and in some locations this damage is quite noticeable. When foraging for GSOB in coast live oak, woodpeckers feed shallowly, exposing spots of pink-red phloem where bark has been removed. This damage is distinguishable from other types of woodpecker feeding, where the birds notch out deep holes in the bark down to the xylem, or the uniform pattern of feeding holes that sapsuckers produce. After several weeks or months, the phloem the woodpeckers exposed will fade from red to black and will be less visible. GSOB infestations also produce staining on the bark surface that appears as dark wet spots or oozing red sap extruding through the bark on the main stem and larger branches. Bark staining is most noticeable during spring and early summer when the soil is more moist. Bark staining can result from numerous other factors besides GSOB, including infection by microorganisms, colonization by other species of insects, and physical wounds. Larval feeding from GSOB can result in cracks in the outer bark that reach as deep as the interface of the xylem and phloem and extend several inches down the trunk of the tree. If no other GSOB injury symptoms, such as D-shaped holes or larval galleries, are visible, then bark staining is probably due to another agent. Other Oak Pests and Injury There are several other oak pests that cause injury similar to GSOB. For example, in coastal Northern and Central California, infection by the sudden oak death (SOD) causal agent Phytophthora ramorum results in similar staining on the bark of the main stem. Western oak bark beetle attacks can also cause similar patterns of staining, but the stain spots are typically much smaller and centered on the pin-sized entrance holes of the adult bark beetles. Be sure to confirm the presence of GSOB and eliminate the possibility that these other agents have caused the injury to oaks. Oval and round emergence holes are characteristic of other secondary wood borers and bark beetles. These emergence holes can vary in diameter from the size of a pencil lead to 1/4 inch. Injury from other wood borers may be confined to the inner and outer bark or penetrate more deeply into the wood, whereas injury from GSOB is rarely found in the wood and emergence holes are D-shaped. Table 1 lists common insects that bore into oaks in Southern California along with descriptions of their emergence holes. Note that these pests can occur as complexes such that one oak may be colonized initially by GSOB but later also be colonized by western oak bark beetles, ambrosia beetles, or cerambycid wood borers. Frass is indicative of insect feeding in trees and can appear as round or oval pellets, fine white or red powder, loosely packed wood shavings, or tightly packed granular wood particles. Frass from other borers can be found on the bark exterior, on the wood surface, or in the wood. GSOB frass is tightly packed and granular, typically black, and found mostly on the surface of the xylem. Flagging (distinct branch or twig death in the crown) is not frequently associated with GSOB injury. Rather, crowns of oaks infested with GSOB exhibit a more uniform pattern of dieback. When branch flagging is found sporadically throughout the crown and typically on shaded branches, the cause is often the oak twig girdler (Agrilus angelicus), canker fungi, or scale insects. Good sources of information about other pests infesting oaks in California include Oaks in the Urban Landscape and A Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of California Oaks.",
    "managementPestNote": "Signs of GSOB infestation may not be obvious in the early stages of injury. Large diameter oaks (i.e., those greater than 18 inches dbh), which are more susceptible to infestation and mortality, should be surveyed first if a large area is being assessed. Examine trees for all injury symptoms including crown thinning, bark staining, woodpecker foraging, and D-shaped emergence holes. On infested trees, removing bark to expose larval galleries and larvae can assist in confirming the presence of GSOB. Oaks in high-value settings such as landscapes, parks, and recreation areas, or any oaks of special concern should be monitored for infestation once a year by looking for emergence holes and other symptoms. Trees with excessive crown thinning and dieback and more than 100 emergence holes on the lower trunk are considered severely infested and will probably die in the next few years. A GSOB infestation should be positively confirmed before initiating management options. D-shaped emergence holes are the most definitive indicator of GSOB infestation and are required to confirm an infested tree. Crown thinning and bark staining alone don’t always indicate that GSOB has infested a tree. Refer to the UC IPM publication Goldspotted Oak Borer Field Identification Guide\t(PDF) for detailed guidelines about how to assess oak health. Purple-prism flight-intercept traps have been used in research and detection projects, but trap catches haven’t been reliable enough to assist in making management decisions. Neither purple-prism traps nor any other trap is attractive enough to GSOB to be used as a suppression tool. At present, management programs for GSOB are focused on limiting its spread into new areas and protecting healthy trees. Specific and targeted pest management guidelines for controlling GSOB in infested trees with insecticides or other tools will require additional research. What follows are recommendations based on preliminary research findings and on techniques available from more well-known phloem borers in hardwoods. Planting Less Susceptible or Resistant Oaks The primary oak species that GSOB has killed in the currently infested areas of San Diego and Riverside counties are coast live oak and California black oak, both red oaks. Red oaks greater than 10 inches dbh are at risk for injury, and those greater than 18 inches have the highest risk for mortality from GSOB. Canyon live oak may also be injured and killed. Although Engelmann oak may be lightly attacked, it doesn’t appear to be seriously injured. There is currently limited information about the susceptibility of other non-native oak species such as cork oak or holly oak. When planting trees in infested areas, consider planting nonoak species or Engelmann oak. Even trees of susceptible species are unlikely to be attacked or killed when their diameters are less than 10 inches. Insecticide applications shouldn’t be required on less susceptible species or small diameter red oaks.\tTable 1.

These trees likely can’t be saved, and as they die the potential for falling limbs presents a hazard to humans and to structures. Fuel from dead oaks also presents a fire hazard, and this is particularly dangerous around structures. When removing trees, cut stumps flush to the ground, because GSOB larvae can survive and develop in stumps of cut trees for at least a year. Treat and handle cut wood carefully to prevent GSOB reemergence; see Treating Cut Wood below. Replanting in Infested Areas If GSOB has killed one or more oaks on your property, consider replanting with native nonoak species or the more resistant Engelmann oak. Avoid replanting with susceptible species. Diversifying an area with several tree species is likely to provide a more resilient landscape over the long term. Treating Cut Wood Human-assisted movement of infested cut wood or logs represents the most significant threat for spreading GSOB in California and has likely occurred multiple times within San Diego County and between San Diego and Riverside counties already. GSOB develops in and adults emerge readily from firewood-sized pieces of oak wood. Several options are available for handling wood cut from infested oaks. The simplest and easiest is to not move wood from the infested site. Wood that has been cut and seasoned for two years on site should be free of viable GSOB. Don’t leave piles of infested wood directly under or near uninfested oaks—even in infested areas—as this could lead to accidental infestation of new trees. If cut wood must be moved outside the infested area, it should be treated by tarping or screening (containment) for two years, grinding, or debarking prior to transport. These practices are also prudent in lightly infested areas to slow the movement of beetles into healthy trees. Determining which management option to use depends on the size of the managed area, cost, availability of time, and availability of resources. Containment Tarping or screening cut wood can limit GSOB dispersal from small woodpiles. Wrap piles of cut or split wood with a clear, sturdy (at least 6 mil), UV-resistant plastic tarp. Don’t use opaque tarps. Seal the edges of the tarp by covering them with soil, and avoid puncturing the tarp; any holes that form must be sealed. Tarping with clear plastic doesn’t significantly reduce emergence of GSOB adults from cut wood, but well-sealed tarps will contain any emerging adults and prevent them from infesting new trees. Alternatively, small woodpiles might be surrounded with screening to prevent the dispersal of adult GSOB. A fine wire-mesh screen (1 mm), small enough so mosquitoes can be excluded, may also be used; screen cages around woodpiles must be completely sealed so emerging beetles can’t escape. Fold seams neatly and secure with binder clips, staples, or a combination of the two. Leave piles of tarped or screened cut wood on site and in full direct sunlight for at least two years, checking them periodically and sealing any holes. Grinding Grinding infested wood is probably the best method to ensure beetles won’t survive. Grinding to a 3-minus standard—which shreds wood into narrow strips typically no more than 3 inches long, 1 inch wide and 1/2 inch thick—will destroy bark and eliminate all life stages of GSOB. Grinding wood from October through April (i.e., prior to GSOB adult emergence) is recommended for this treatment. This management option is ideal for large amounts of infested cut wood; however, it requires large specialized equipment and thus isn’t feasible for many small residential situations where only one or two trees are involved. Many chippers used by landscape professionals will not have the capacity to handle the large diameter rounds of oak wood. Debarking Removing the bark from cut wood to be used for firewood will separate GSOB populations from wood. All bark and phloem must be removed down to the wood, including even small pieces thicker than 1/2 inch. Viable GSOB will remain in the removed bark and shavings, so these must be destroyed, tarped, or left at the wood collection site, as far away from living trees as possible. Removing bark from cut pieces of wood by hand is labor intensive and is most feasible for small quantities (less than one cord) of firewood from GSOB-infested trees. Biological Control Three primary natural enemies have been associated with GSOB in Arizona and California, but none is currently believed to be providing significant levels of control. These natural enemies are Atanycolus simplex (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) and Calosota elongata (Hymenoptera: Eupelmidae), both parasitoid wasps that attack and kill GSOB larvae, and a predatory mite, Pyemotes tritici (Trombidiformes: Pyemotidae). P. tritici is a generalist predatory mite with a cosmopolitan distribution that feeds on GSOB larvae, pupae, and adults. Further research is needed in order to show the effectiveness of biological control agents in California. Woodpeckers also prey on GSOB larvae and pupae in California, but their impact on GSOB populations hasn’t been assessed. Chemical Control Although research testing various insecticides for GSOB management is underway, results are too preliminary to provide precise guidelines for this newly arrived species. In general, insecticide treatments for controlling wood borers are more effective for preventing infestation of healthy trees than combating existing infestations. Trees with moderate to severe injury are likely to be difficult if not impossible to save with current management tools. Severely infested trees should be removed rather than sprayed and wood from these trees properly managed to prevent GSOB spread. Some of the information provided here is based on research on other related borers, especially the emerald ash borer, Agrilis planipennis ; see Insecticide Options for Protecting Ash Trees from Emerald Ash Borer. The insecticide products most likely to be effective against GSOB are available only to state licensed and county registered pesticide applicators (QACs or QALs). Home-use, over-the-counter products may not contain adequate levels of insecticide to control this pest. Property owners should hire a pest control professional who has the experience and proper equipment for treating large oak trees. Inappropriately applied pesticides can have negative health and environmental impacts. Cover and Barrier Spray Insecticides The goal of applying cover or barrier sprays to bark is to kill newly hatched larvae as they attempt to bore into the bark and to reduce the population of adults that land on the bark surface to lay eggs. These sprays won’t likely control larvae once they are beneath the bark. Drift from application of cover sprays to the upper stem and larger branches may also deliver insecticide to the foliage where it may kill adults as they attempt to feed. Cover sprays have been somewhat effective against other species of borers and may provide some control of GSOB. Common insecticides labeled for this use are pyrethroids (e.g., permethrin, cyfluthrin, and bifenthrin) and EC formulations of carbaryl. Laboratory research has shown that carbaryl or bifenthrin will kill GSOB adults that come in contact with treated wood or feed on treated leaves. If making cover sprays, be sure to use products labeled for trunk treatments. Applications should be made in early May to slightly precede adult flight activity, which lasts from late May through September. The suggested insecticides have a long residual activity on the bark or foliage surface so that a single spray may be effective through the egg-laying season. Sprays should be applied to completely cover the main trunk and branches that are greater than 5 inches in diameter. Annual treatments are likely to be required. The insecticides used for cover sprays are broad-spectrum persistent toxicants and may pose hazards for water quality, beneficial insects, and nontarget organisms if not handled properly. Systemic Insecticides Systemic insecticides are applied into the soil or injected into trunks and taken up through the tree, thereby killing insects feeding within wood or on leaves. Some landscape pest control professionals are making applications of imidacloprid to control GSOB. Although research is underway, there aren’t enough data to confirm the effectiveness of these treatments against GSOB. Treatment of ash trees with imidacloprid injections for the related emerald ash borer suppressed the pest and prolonged the life of trees, but ultimately infested trees died even after treatment. Trunk injections of imidacloprid are believed to be more effective than soil injections; however, trunk injections often cause significant wounds. Long cracks in the bark may frequently appear as a wound response to injection of coast live oaks, potentially allowing infection by secondary pathogens. Formulations of imidacloprid available to homeowners as soil drenches have lower allowable application rates and are less likely to provide control, especially on trees with diameters larger than 18 inches dbh—those most likely to be seriously injured by GSOB. Another systemic insecticide, emamectin benzoate (TREE-äge), received registration for use as a trunk injection in California in April 2012, but its effectiveness against GSOB is still under evaluation. As with other treatments, if effective, systemic insecticides are probably more likely to be effective in protecting uninfested or lightly infested oaks than oaks with moderate or more severe levels of infestation. Systemic insecticides aren’t likely to provide suppression in low-vigor trees, because the active ingredient won’t be adequately transported throughout the tree due to lack of uptake and disruption of conductive tissues in the phloem and xylem. The best time to make trunk injections is from mid-winter to early spring when precipitation is frequent. Watering trees after application may assist with translocating the insecticide within the tree especially if further rains aren’t expected. Some arborists may choose to combine systemic insecticides with cover or barrier sprays to high-value healthy trees in GSOB-infested areas; however, there is no reliable research data confirming that these treatments will fully protect trees. Insecticides to control GSOB shouldn’t be used in areas where GSOB isn’t currently established. Also, insecticide applications aren’t suggested for Engelmann oak or other less susceptible oaks or for trees smaller than 10 inches dbh. GSOB Integrated Pest Management Plans Landowners or managers with high-value red oaks in or near GSOB-infested areas should develop a GSOB management plan for their site. These plans should identify and map susceptible trees on the property and outline a plan for regularly monitoring tree health. The plan should also include guidelines for removing severely infested trees, specifications for treating or disposing of cut infested wood, parameters for when using preventive insecticide treatments may be appropriate, and a plan for restoration planting if large numbers of trees must be removed.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The glassy-winged sharpshooter, Homalodisca vitripennis (formerly H. coagulata), is an insect that was introduced into California in the late 1980s. This insect is native to the southeastern United States and was most likely brought into southern California accidentally as egg masses in ornamental or agricultural plant foliage. BACKGROUND The glassy-winged sharpshooter is a large leafhopper that obtains its nutrients by feeding on plant fluids in the xylem, the water-conducting tissues of a plant. Feeding on plants rarely causes significant plant damage, although the insects do excrete copious amounts of liquid that can make leaves and fruit appear whitewashed when dry. The excrement, which is not necessarily damaging, can be a cosmetic nuisance when shade trees are heavily infested, because cars parked under the trees tend to become spotted. Additionally, during hot weather, large populations of glassy-winged sharpshooters feeding on small plants may cause them to wilt. The main problem associated with the glassy-winged sharpshooter is that it can transmit the plant-pathogenic bacterium Xylella fastidiosa from one plant to another. This bacterium has a broad host range, able to infect hundreds of plant species in dozens of plant families. Although infection by X. fastidiosa does not lead to disease in many of these host plants, it does cause several important, often fatal, plant diseases in California. This includes Pierce’s disease of grape, alfalfa dwarf, almond leaf scorch, and mulberry leaf scorch. Other diseases caused by this bacterium in landscape plants include oleander leaf scorch, sweet gum dieback, and cherry plum leaf scorch. Other strains of X. fastidiosa cause phony peach disease, plum leaf scald, bacterial leaf scorch in a wide range of shade trees (sycamore, elm, maple, oak), citrus variegated chlorosis, coffee leaf scorch, and olive quick decline disease, but these diseases have not been confirmed in California. It should be noted that the strain of X. fastidiosa that causes oleander leaf scorch will not cause Pierce’s disease in grapes and the strain of X. fastidiosa that causes mulberry leaf scorch does not cause disease in oleanders or grapes. At this time there is no cure for any of these diseases. For more information on oleander leaf scorch, see the Pest Notes: Oleander Leaf Scorch. When a glassy-winged sharpshooter feeds on a plant that is infected with X. fastidiosa, it may acquire the bacteria, which attaches to and multiplies within specific portions of the insect’s mouthparts. The sharpshooter then may inoculate the bacteria to another plant when it feeds. Once acquired, sharpshooter adults are infective immediately, and they remain so for the remainder of their life. Immature sharpshooters are only infective until they molt, at which time they shed the bacteria as they pass to the next stage of development.

    "managementPestNote": "For areas where the glassy-winged sharpshooter is not established, it continues to be important to identify new infestations as soon as possible. This requires careful monitoring and detection. If you find glassy-winged sharpshooter in an area not currently known to have this pest, immediately call the California Department of Food & Agriculture pest hotline at 1-800-491-1899, or contact your local agricultural commissioner’s office. In areas where the glassy-winged sharpshooter is established, the principal reason for controlling the glassy-winged sharpshooter is to prevent the spread of X. fastidiosa to susceptible plants. Plants cannot be cured of the disease. Management of glassy-winged sharpshooters in a residential setting relies on biological control in the surrounding environment and, in some cases, chemical control. Detection and Monitoring Even though this insect is large enough to be seen with the naked eye, it is inconspicuous in nature. The brown coloration of the insect blends in with the color of the twigs where it is usually found, and it hides by moving to the other side of the twig or branch when it detects movement or is otherwise disturbed. When inspecting host plants for glassy-winged sharpshooters, focus your attention about 6 inches to 1 foot from the tips of new shoots. This is where they prefer to feed. For taller hosts such as trees and grape arbors, the presence of small droplets of liquid falling as a mist from the canopy or whitish, powdery coating on leaves or fruit indicated that sharpshooters are present overhead. Yellow sticky cards are the preferred monitoring method for government agencies that track glassy-winged sharpshooter populations. If you find one of these cards on your property, direct any questions or inquiries to the phone number indicated on the trap. Cultural Control Once glassy-winged sharpshooter is established in an area, there are no cultural controls available to manage them. However, preventing transport of infested plant material to areas where glassy-winged sharpshooter is not established is an essential step in slowing further spread in California. Nurseries shipping plants out of an infested area must follow rigorous treatment programs and have the plants inspected before they are shipped and again after they arrive at their destination. Biological Control Following the invasion of glassy-winged sharpshooters in California, multiple species of small wasps in the genus Cosmocomoidea (formerly Gonatocerus) were introduced for its control. These parasitoids, which attack and complete their entire life cycle within a glassy-winged sharpshooter egg, are now established in all regions of California where glassy-winged sharpshooters exist. Eggs parasitized by these tiny wasps are easily identified by pinpoint holes found at one end of the egg (Figure 5). Parasitoid populations are typically low early in the year, providing modest parasitism (10 to 50%). However, by the late summer or early fall these wasps can cause upwards of 90% mortality of glassy-winged sharpshooter eggs. It is important to support biological control by avoiding the use of broad-spectrum insecticides that may kill parasitoids and beneficial arthropods that eat sharpshooters (such as spiders, assassin bugs, praying mantids, and lacewings). Chemical Control In the event of glassy-winged sharpshooter spread to new areas, residential insecticide treatments may be necessary as part of localized eradication efforts by state and federal regulatory agencies. Otherwise, in most parts of California, insecticide applications for the control of glassy-winged sharpshooter are typically not recommended around homes and urban landscapes. This is because populations are generally low and under good biological control, and there is a relatively low prevalence of Xylella diseases in urban settings. The exceptions are cases where residents notice large sharpshooter populations on particularly favored hosts, such as some varieties of citrus, or rare instances where populations in ornamental plantings are high enough that white residues from excrement production become a significant nuisance. The most common insecticides used for glassy-winged sharpshooter contain the active ingredient imidacloprid. Some retail imidacloprid products available to residents include Bayer BioAdvanced 12 Month Tree and Shrub and Bayer Advanced Fruit, Citrus and Vegetable Insect Control. Applications are made by calculating the amount of product needed (depending on the size of the tree or shrub), diluting the product with water, and pouring the mixture around the base of the plant where it soaks into the soil. With appropriate watering, the active ingredient is absorbed by the roots and moved throughout the plant in sufficient quantities to protect against sharpshooters. Typically, the plant becomes protected within a few weeks. Imidacloprid treatments may have a secondary benefit by helping to control other common sucking insect pests, such as some scales, aphids, or whiteflies. Recent research has suggested that imidacloprid may be less effective than in the past when used against glassy-winged sharpshooters in agricultural fields in Kern and Tulare Counties. Therefore, urban landscapes close to these agricultural areas may experience less effective control with imidacloprid products. In instances where the white excrement produced by this pest causes residues on cars or other surfaces, other insecticides can be applied to infested foliage to provide immediate relief. The least toxic and least disruptive to biological control are insecticidal soaps and oils. Insecticidal soaps and oils are only effective in killing the soft-bodied nymphs of the glassy-winged sharpshooter and must directly contact the insect to kill it, so thorough coverage of the plant or tree foliage is essential. Applications of these materials need to be repeated at 7- to 10-day intervals. Other insecticides (including Bioadvanced Insect, Disease and Mite Control, Ortho Insect, Mite and Disease 3-in-1, or Sevin Insect Killer) are available for foliar applications that are more effective for longer periods of time. However, these materials may be more harmful to the parasitic wasps and predatory insects that provide biological control, and they can be toxic to pollinators. For all insecticide applications, it is important to follow application instructions on the label to minimize harm to pollinators and other beneficial insects.",

    "damagePestNote": "Whiteflies can damage plants directly by their feeding. Both nymphal and adult whiteflies feed by inserting their needlelike mouthparts into the vascular tissue or phloem of the leaves and suck out the plant sap. If the numbers of whiteflies per leaf are great enough, the plant will suffer from lack of water and nutrients, resulting in a weakened plant and loss of leaves but rarely in plant death. However, the most common and annoying problems associated with giant whiteflies are the waxy, hairlike filaments and growth of unsightly sooty mold. During feeding, whiteflies excrete a sticky, sugary solution called honeydew that accumulates on leaves and fosters the growth of the black sooty mold fungus. This sooty mold is not only unattractive, it also reduces the photosynthetic (food-producing) abilities of the leaves.",
    "managementPestNote": "Manage giant whiteflies in your landscape with an integrated program that includes removal of infested leaves and, if necessary, washing whiteflies off leaves with water. When choosing plants, consider species less susceptible to giant whitefly. Biological control agents are presently being introduced and have become established in parts of southern California. Check with your University of California Cooperative Extension farm advisor about the status of the biological control program in your area. Insecticides are not generally recommended because they destroy the biological control agents. A forceful stream of water (syringing) directed at colonies can be just as effective as insecticide sprays. Leaf or Plant Removal The tendency of giant whitefly adults to remain on the plant where they developed leads to a strongly clustered distribution. This clustering behavior means that removing relatively few leaves can destroy large numbers of whiteflies. Leaf removal is most effective when populations are restricted to a few plants or leaves. Thus, monitoring to detect early infestations is extremely important in control of giant whitefly. Place infested material in plastic bags, seal, and remove the bags from the property. If the infested leaves are left in the open after removal, a portion of the adult whitefly population may migrate to new plants. Leaf removal will work better on some plants than others. Giant whitefly is currently found on many different plant species, and it reproduces more successfully on some than on others. On less preferred hosts, such as yellow hibiscus, removal of leaves should be sufficient to control populations. On more preferred host plants, such as red hibiscus, giant bird of paradise, and Xylosma, control will require early detection, rigorous leaf removal, and syringing with water. In high traffic or visible areas that are adjacent to walkways, doors, or windows, removing or replacing plants infested by giant whitefly may be an option. Syringing The use of a strong stream of water directed to the undersides of infested leaves (syringing) can be very effective in managing giant whitefly. Comparison studies with several pesticides indicate that syringing performed as well or better than chemical treatments. With high whitefly populations, syringing is recommended at least once a week. As populations decrease, intervals can be lengthened to once every 2 or 3 weeks. An additional advantage of syringing is improved plant appearance. Moreover, unlike insecticide sprays, water syringing will not have the negative impact on biological control programs. Biological Control Native insect predators such as green lacewings (Chrysopa and Chrysoperla spp.), larvae of syrphid flies (also called flower flies and hover flies), and lady beetle adults and larvae (Cycloneda polita and Delphastus catalinae) attack giant whitefly in California but do not provide adequate biological control. The introduced Asian lady beetle, Harmonia axyridis, also feeds on this pest. Parasitic wasps often found parasitizing giant whitefly include Entedononecremnus krauteri and Encarsia hispida. Entedononecremnus krauteri is a dark parasitic wasp with red eyes and is often observed on the upper surface of leaves where it lays eggs through the leaf surface into whiteflies on the undersides of leaves. Two other parasites of giant whitefly, Encarsiella noyesii and Idioporus affinis, have more recently been introduced into California from Mexico to help control populations of the giant whitefly. These tiny, stingless, parasitic wasps lay their eggs inside the whitefly larvae. When the wasp eggs hatch, their larvae feed on the giant whitefly larvae. The wasp then pupates and emerges, leaving behind either a hollow, yellowish shell (Idioporus affinis) or a clear shell in which the black skin that the parasite shed is visible (Encarsiella noyesii) . In both shells, with the aid of a magnifying glass, you can see the round exit holes through which the parasites emerged. While these parasites don't completely eradicate all of the whiteflies, they can dramatically reduce their numbers to all but a small number at the base of plants. For most situations, this level of control is considered satisfactory. Some natural enemies are commercially available for release against giant whitefly, but there is no evidence that purchasing and releasing natural enemies is effective. The whitefly parasites mentioned above are being released by University of California and California state scientists. It is hoped that these parasites will permanently establish and distribute themselves throughout infested areas; release by home gardeners should not be necessary. Chemical Control Although some insecticides are registered to control giant whitefly either by foliar or soil application, their use is not recommended if parasites are present in the area. To determine if parasitic wasps are present, use a hand lens to examine several leaves containing whitefly nymphs. Look for a dark discoloration of the nymph or the tiny holes that parasites make when they emerge from the dead larva. If there is evidence of parasites, insecticide treatments should not be necessary. If you do choose to use insecticides, select least-toxic products such as insecticidal soaps or oils. Remember to follow label directions and spray undersides of leaves where whitefly colonies are found.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Giant whiteflies can cover a beautiful plant with white fuzzy wax and sticky honeydew, turning it into an unsightly mess. First discovered in San Diego County in October 1992, this whitefly has spread northward into other areas of California. Although affected plants may be weakened, they rarely die. To manage giant whitefly, wash off plants with water and encourage natural enemies. What plants are affected? Many ornamentals including hibiscus, giant bird of paradise, begonia, Xylosma. Fruit trees including citrus, avocado, mulberry and banana. Look or these damage symptoms on affected plants: Long, white, waxy filaments produced by the whitefly give the leaf surface a bearded appearance. These hairlike strands may be mistaken for a fungal infection. Large amounts of sticky honeydew excreted by the whitefly as it feeds on plant sap. Black sooty mold growing on the honeydew. How to recognize the whitefly: Adults are small (3/16 inch long), white with light brown markings on their wings, and usually found in groups on the undersides of leaves. Nymphs are yellowish, small, oval, have no legs, and don't move. To reduce problems, use an integrated program that includes: Removing infested leaves. Washing giant whiteflies off leaves with a strong stream of water. Planting species less susceptible to giant whitefly. Avoiding insecticides that injure natural enemies, such as lacewings, lady beetles, syrphid flies, and parasitic wasps. What about insecticides? Don’t use insecticides if beneficial insects, including parasites and predators, are present in the area. To confirm the presence of parasitic wasps, use a magnifying glass to look for parasite exit holes on giant whitefly nymphs or darkened nymphs (see photo). If you do choose to use an insecticide, select least toxic products such as insecticidal soaps or oils. Spray the undersides of the leaves where whitefly colonies are found. Remember to follow label directions. ",

Adult fungus gnats may emerge from houseplants indoors and become a nuisance.",
    "damagePestNote": "Adult fungus gnats don’t damage plants or bite people; their presence is primarily considered a nuisance. Larvae, however, when present in large numbers, can damage roots and stunt plant growth, particularly in seedlings and young plants. Significant root damage and even plant death have been observed in interior plantscapes and in houseplants when high populations were associated with moist, organically-rich soil. Thus, a houseplant that is wilting may not indicate a lack of water, but rather root damage by fungus gnat larvae or (more commonly) other causes of unhealthy roots. However, too much or too little water, root decay fungi, and improper soil conditions (e.g., poor drainage, or waterlogging) are much more common causes of wilted plants. Serious fungus gnat damage is more common in greenhouses, nurseries, and sod farms. Although larvae also feed on plant roots outdoors, they don’t usually cause serious damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "Most of the fungus gnat’s life is spent as a larva and pupa in organic matter or soil, so the most effective control methods target these immature stages rather than attempting to directly control the mobile, short-lived adults. Physical and cultural management tactics—primarily the reductions of excess moisture and organic debris—are key to reducing fungus gnat problems. Commercially-available and naturally-occurring biological control agents can also control this pest. Insecticides are considered an important control option in some commercial plant production but generally aren’t recommended for fungus gnat management in and around the home. Monitoring Visual inspection for adults usually is adequate for determining whether a problem exists. You will see adults resting on plants, soil, windows, or walls, or you might see them in flight. Besides looking for adults, check plant pots for excessively moist conditions and organic debris where larvae feed. Yellow sticky traps can be used to trap adults. Chunks of raw potato placed in pots with the cut sides down (not the peels) are sometimes used to monitor for larvae. Water and Soil Management Because fungus gnats thrive in moist conditions, especially where there is an abundance of decaying vegetation and fungi, avoid overwatering and provide good drainage. Allow the surface of container soil to dry between waterings. Clean up standing water, and eliminate any plumbing or irrigation system leaks. Moist and decomposing grass clippings, compost, organic fertilizers, and mulches are also favorite breeding spots. Avoid using incompletely-composted organic matter in potting media unless it is pasteurized first, because it will often be infested with fungus gnats. Improve the drainage of the potting mix (e.g., increase the proportion of perlite or sand in the mix). Minimize organic debris around buildings and crops. Avoid fertilizing with excessive amounts of manure, blood meal, or similar organic materials. Screen and caulk leaky windows and doors to help prevent pests from coming indoors. If you have infested plants, don’t move them to new areas where flies can emerge to infest other pots. In some cases you may wish to toss out severely infested plants. Purchase and use only pasteurized container mix or potting mix. Commercial growers often treat potting soil with heat or steam before using it; this will kill flies and the algae and microorganisms they feed on. Home gardeners can solarize soil:\tMoisten it.\tPlace it in a bag of transparent plastic or black plastic.\tMake the pile no deeper than about 8 inches.\tPlace the bagged soil on a slightly elevated surface, such as a pallet in a sunny location, for about 4 to 6 weeks.\tSee the Pest Note: Soil Solarization for details. Store pasteurized potting soil off the ground and in closed containers to prevent it from becoming infested before use. Trapping In home situations where fungus gnat adults are a nuisance, it may be possible to reduce the problem by using sticky traps available at retail nursery and garden centers. Yellow sticky traps can be cut into smaller squares, attached to wooden skewers or sticks and placed in pots to trap adults. Also, raw potato chunks placed in the soil are very attractive to fungus gnat larvae. These may be used not only to check pots for larvae but also to trap them away from plant roots. After a few days in a pot, remove infested chunks, dispose of them, and replace with fresh ones. Biological Control Three commercially available biological control agents can be purchased to control fungus gnats in pots or container media (Table 1). These include Steinernema nematodes, Hypoaspis predatory mites, and the biological insecticide Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti). Several Bti products (Mosquito Bits, Gnatrol) are readily available in retail nurseries and garden centers, so these products may be the most convenient for home gardeners to use. Bti does not reproduce or persist indoors, so infestations in potting media might require repeated applications at about five-day intervals to provide control. Nematodes and Hypoaspis mites must be mail-ordered and are live and perishable products, requiring immediate application. Nematodes can provide relatively long-term control of fungus gnat larvae, and they can be self-reproducing after several inoculative applications to establish their populations. Steinernema feltiae is more effective against fungus gnats than other commercially available nematode species. Mix Bti or nematodes with water, and apply as a soil drench, or spray onto media using a hand-pump spray bottle or other spray equipment, following label directions. Several natural enemies help to manage fungus gnat populations in outdoor systems, such as landscapes and gardens, and indoors in greenhouses and conservatories, including the predatory hunter flies, Coenosia spp. These flies catch and consume adult fungus gnats in mid-air, and prey on fungus gnat larvae in soil while developing as larvae themselves. Conserve these and other natural enemies by avoiding broad-spectrum insecticide applications.\tTable 1. Commercially Available Biological Pesticides and Natural Enemies for Controlling Fungus Gnat Larvae.\nBiological\tComments\nBacillus thuringiensis subspecies israelensis (Bti) (Gnatrol)\tA naturally occurring, spore-forming bacterium produced commercially by fermentation. Bti applied at labeled rates provides temporary control and is toxic only to fly larvae, such as mosquitoes, black flies, and fungus gnats. Repeat applications commonly are needed for long-term control. This Bt is a different subspecies from that applied to foliage to control caterpillars. Bt labeled for caterpillars is not effective against fly larvae.\nHypoaspis (= Geolaelaps or Stratiolaelaps) miles\tA light-brownish predaceous mite adapted to feeding in the upper layers of moist soil. Preys on fungus gnat larvae and pupae, thrips pupae, springtails, and other tiny invertebrates. Commercial mites commonly are shipped in a shaker-type container used to apply them. Recommended rates in commercial nurseries are about 1/2 to several dozen mites per container or square foot of media. Make applications before pests become abundant. Hypoaspis probably won’t perform very well in individual houseplants and probably isn’t a good choice for use in homes.\nSteinernema feltiae\tThis nematode is effective when temperatures are between 60° to 90°F and conditions are moist. You can apply it as a soil drench and to media using conventional spray equipment. Nematodes reproduce and actively search for hosts, so under moist conditions they can provide season-long control after several initial applications to establish populations.\nThese materials are essentially nontoxic to people and are compatible for application in combination. Bt is available from many well-stocked nurseries and garden supply stores. Predaceous mites, Bti, and nematodes, are commercially available through mail order from special suppliers.\nChemical Control Insecticides are rarely warranted to control these flies in and around homes. However, if you do apply an insecticide for fungus gnats, consider using Bti or Steinernema feltiae nematodes to control the larvae; see the section Biological Control for more information. If Bti or nematodes aren’t available and high populations are intolerable, pyrethrins or a pyrethroid insecticide may provide temporary, fast-acting control. Spray the surface of potting soil and plant parts where adults typically rest. Do not aerially fog indoors or attempt to spray adult gnats in flight. Be sure the product is labeled for your particular use (e.g., for \"house plants\") and read and follow the product's directions. Pyrethrins have low toxicity to people and pets and are the active ingredients in the botanical pyrethrum, which is derived from flowers of certain chrysanthemums. Many products include a petroleum-derived synergist (piperonyl butoxide, or PBO) to increase pyrethrum effectiveness. Pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin) are synthesized from petroleum to be chemically similar to pyrethrins; they often are more effective and persistent but are more toxic to beneficial insects. When using these products on houseplants or interiorscape containers, if possible move plants outdoors for treatment as a precaution, and wait about a day after applying the chemical before bringing them back inside. For information on managing fungus gnats in commercial flower, nursery or greenhouse operations, see the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Floriculture and Ornamental Nurseries and the book Integrated Pest Management for Floriculture and Nurseries.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Of the thousands of species of flies, only a few are common pests in and around the home. Some of the more common nuisance flies are the house fly (Musca domestica), the face fly (Musca autumnalis), the stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), the little house fly (Fannia canicularis), and several species of blow flies (especially in the genus Lucilia). These pests breed in animal wastes and decaying organic material, including animal carrion and food waste from which they can pick up bacteria and viruses that may cause human disease. All flies undergo complete metamorphosis with egg, larva, pupa, and adult stages in their development. The female fly deposits her eggs in animal feces, carrion or moist organic material where the larvae, or \"maggots,\" complete their development, feeding on bacteria associated with their developmental site. The maggots will pass through three larval stages increasing in size with each stage. When the maggots have completed their development and are ready to undergo the next step in their metamorphosis, they convert their last larval skin into a puparium, a hardened shell within which the pupa develops. Within the puparium, the pupa transforms into an adult fly, which pops off the end of the puparium and emerges. Body fluids pump into the fly’s wing veins causing the wings to unfold and expand and allowing them to dry and harden so that the adult can fly. The rate of fly development is dependent upon temperature; and under optimal summertime conditions, flies may develop from egg to adult in as little as 7 days. Once the female fly has mated, she can lay several batches of eggs, typically containing over 100 eggs each. While humans commonly find adult flies to be the most bothersome life stage, the larval stage is the best target for management efforts. Elimination of larval habitat is the preferred method of pest fly suppression. By removing material in which the larvae develop, the life cycle of the fly can be broken, preventing subsequent production of adult flies. While chemical pesticides may be effective for suppressing adult fly populations in some situations, they are not a substitute for proper sanitation and aggressive elimination of fly developmental sites. Flies can quickly develop resistance to insecticides and house flies are now resistant to many of the pesticides registered for their management. Use insecticides only as a last resort to obtain immediate control of adult flies. HOUSE FLY Identification and Life Cycle The house fly (Musca domestica) is a cosmopolitan companion of humans and domestic animals. House flies are generally found in greatest numbers during the hotter summer months. House flies are less than 3⁄8 inch in length and have four dark stripes down the back of their thorax. House flies have sponging mouthparts and eat solid food by first liquefying it with their saliva. House flies can also regurgitate onto a solid food to assist with the liquefying process. Under favorable conditions, house fly numbers can increase quickly due to their rapid immature developmental time and the large number of eggs produced by each female—several batches of about 100 to 150 eggs. Eggs are laid in warm, moist, organic materials such as manure, garbage, lawn clippings, decaying vegetables and fruits, or soils contaminated with any of these materials. Larvae of the house fly are cream colored, have a blunt posterior end, and taper to a point at the head. Young larvae respond negatively to light and will burrow into the organic material in which they are developing. Older larvae respond positively to light and will emerge from their organic habitat to seek drier and cooler areas to transform into pupae. Under optimal summertime conditions, house flies can complete their development from egg to adult in as little as 7 days. Damage Because they have sponging mouthparts, house flies cannot bite; however, they may play an important role in disease transmission to humans and animals. House flies can carry a number of disease agents which they pick up while feeding on animal feces, animal body secretions, or kitchen waste and which they can deposit onto human foods following contact with or feeding on these human foods. House flies are known to carry bacteria and viruses that cause conditions such as diarrhea, cholera, food poisoning, yaws, dysentery, and eye infections. House flies can also cause nuisance to homeowners by their persistent attempts to land on human foods or even humans themselves (they will readily feed on animal sweat and other body secretions). House flies also leave dark fecal and regurgitation spots on wall surfaces where they rest, and with a preference for resting on light colored surfaces, these spots can be quite noticeable when fly numbers are high. Management of House Flies Flies found inside a building have entered from the outside in almost all cases. Therefore, barriers preventing access to the building are the first line of defense. Cracks around windows and doors where flies may enter should be sealed. Well-fitted screens will also limit their access to buildings. Outdoors, regular removal (at least once a week) and disposal of organic waste, including dog feces, rotting fruit, and kitchen waste will reduce the attractiveness of the area to adult flies and limit their breeding sites. Garbage should not be allowed to accumulate and should be placed in plastic bags and held in containers with tight-fitting lids where feasible. Garbage should also be placed as far from a building entrance as is practicable. In general, poor exclusion and lack of sanitation are the major contributors to house fly problems. Sticky fly paper or ribbons are effective at eliminating a few flies in relatively confined areas but are not effective enough to manage heavy infestations or to provide control in an outdoor setting. Inverted cone traps containing fly food attractants can be readily purchased commercially and are effective when they are not competing with nearby garbage or animal wastes. The fly food attractants used in these inverted cone traps will be quite foul smelling, so the traps should be placed at some distance from occupied structures. Fly traps using ultraviolet light may be effective when used indoors where they are not competing with daytime sunlight. For control of just a few flies, the time-tested fly swatter is appropriate. Don’t use fly swatters near food preparation areas because they may result in contaminating food with insect body parts. Similarly, never use a \"bug zapper\" to kill flies near food preparation areas, as the insect body often explodes upon touching the wires and insect body parts can be propelled over several feet from the device. Selective use of insecticides against house flies is one component of a total fly management program but should only be used after all possible nonchemical strategies have been employed. In most home situations, pesticides are not needed or recommended. Sanitation methods, along with screens to keep flies out of the home, should be sufficient. If sanitation efforts are not possible, a nonresidual pyrethrin aerosol may be used. Outdoors a professional pest control company can be hired to apply residual insecticides to surfaces such as walls and overhangs that flies tend to accumulate on when resting. Fly baits used in trash storage areas may be effective in reducing the number of adult flies, if proper sanitation practices are followed to prevent development of immature flies in the waste. However, when flies have access to garbage, baits alone will not control them. LITTLE HOUSE FLY Identification and Life Cycle Little house fly (Fannia canicularis) is not tolerant of high daytime temperatures and is, therefore, generally most numerous during the cooler spring and fall months in California. As temperatures rise in summer, populations of Fannia diminish unless developmental sites are protected from temperature extremes. Adults are approximately 2/3 the size of the house fly and lack the house fly’s distinctive thoracic stripes. Fannia at rest hold their wings directly over the back rather than holding the wings to form a V-shape as is typical for house flies . Flying aggregations of male Fannia typically form in areas with still air and protected from direct sunlight, such as breezeways and porch areas of residential homes. These swarms of males remain in continuous flight awaiting visitation by unmated females. Male swarms are often formed approximately 5 or 6 feet above the ground; just about head height for an adult human thereby maximizing their nuisance potential. Strong air currents tend to disperse these male aggregations. Larval Fannia are adapted to tolerate a wide moisture range at their developmental sites, making them a particularly difficult nuisance fly to control. Egg laying and larval development frequently occur in animal wastes (especially poultry manure), but various moist organic materials, in particular fermenting grass clippings and compost, can serve as suitable substrates. A related fly, F. femoralis, can also be abundant in cooler coastal areas of California, but this species only rarely causes nuisance. Unlike house fly larvae, larvae of Fannia are brown in color, more flat than round, and have numerous fleshy spines. The developmental time from egg to adult is somewhat longer for little house fly than for the house fly at all temperatures. Damage Little house flies are more reluctant to enter homes than are house flies; instead, they tend to congregate in outdoor areas such as patios, entryways, and garages. As temperatures decline, they seek cover in buildings or protective vegetation. They seldom land on human foods and are not considered a significant carrier of human disease agents. However, their habit of hovering at human face height makes them annoying, though they move readily out of the way when approached. Management of Little House Flies As with all nuisance flies, eliminating breeding sites is the preferred method of controlling Fannia . Accumulations of manure (especially poultry) or other decaying organic matter are ideal developmental sites. These developmental sites must be removed, spread thin to fully dry, or properly composted with pile turning as the composted material undergoes heat cycles. Fannia are not attracted to the same fly baits or traps that collect house flies. Some relief can be obtained by placing strong fans in areas where male Fannia tend to swarm, as the increased air movement will make the site less attractive to them. CANYON FLY Identification and Life Cycle Canyon flies (Fannia benjamini complex) are an emerging urban pest in California. These are native flies that have existed in western North America for a very long time. There are seven related fly species within this complex, which collectively are called \"canyon flies\" due to their geographic association with natural canyons, particularly those within coastal and inland mountain ranges where oak trees dominate the landscape. While distantly related to the other Fannia flies mentioned above, these flies do not appear to develop in animal feces or fermenting green waste. Our best guess at present is that these native flies develop on moist decaying plant matter or leaf litter. However, one canyon fly species (F. conspicua) has become quite problematic in Southern California in recent years following the introduction of an exotic succulent ground cover plant called red apple (Aptenia cordifolia) which was first introduced into the United States in the mid-1980’s and is now widely planted in hillside communities for erosion control and fire protection. The decaying understory of red apple has proven to be an excellent developmental site for this fly species and canyon fly numbers can become incredibly problematic in communities where this plant is common. Adult canyon flies are similar in size to the little house fly but can be distinguished from other flies by their three-spotted abdomen and yellow coloration at the base of their antennae. Like other Fannia flies, canyon flies are not tolerant of high temperatures and adult numbers tend to peak from late spring through early summer, with a second peak in late fall. Their daily activity is also restricted by temperature with activity generally limited to the cooler morning and evening hours during these seasonal periods of peak abundance. The life cycle of canyon flies is similar to other Fannia flies, and the larvae have the same general morphology—flattened body shape with fleshy spines. Damage Canyon flies feed on the body secretions of animals, such as tears, mucus, sweat, and blood from open wounds. Their persistent attempts to land upon the face and body of the host can result in considerable nuisance to humans. While they cannot bite or make a wound to feed upon blood, they do have small prestomal teeth on their mouthparts which they can use to scrape at mucous membranes around the eyes of animals to encourage production of tears or other eye secretions. These flies have been associated with the transmission of an eye worm to cattle. Management of Canyon Flies Adult canyon flies are very difficult to manage. Because these flies feed on animals, they are attracted to several odors associated with animals including carbon dioxide (CO2), a component of animal breath. Traps baited with carbon dioxide will readily capture at least one species of canyon fly (F. conspicua), but removal of these flies using CO2 traps has not proven sufficient to reduce their nuisance. The only successful strategy identified to date for management of these flies is removal of the red apple plant that serves as the developmental site for F. conspicua . For other canyon fly species that do not develop in red apple, there are no management strategies that have proven to be particularly successful. Application of insecticide by fogging vegetation bordering a residence has given some short term relief, but this type of management strategy is not recommended as it impacts many beneficial and benign insect species and typically only provides some management of canyon flies for a few days. FACE FLY Identification and Life Cycle Face flies (Musca autumnalis) are a problem particularly in rural areas of northern and coastal California where pastured cattle are present. The hotter, drier weather in inland Southern California and the southern San Joaquin Valley is not conducive to their development. Face flies require fresh cattle manure for development. The female face fly looks virtually identical to the house fly but male face flies have a distinctive orange-yellow colored abdomen. Like the house fly, it also has sponging mouthparts and cannot bite. However, face fly behavior is distinctive because they are specifically attracted to the eyes, nose, and mouth of cattle and horses. Damage Face flies feed on the eye and nose secretions of cattle and horses in the summer months. Their habit of feeding around the eyes makes them capable of transmitting pinkeye to livestock, and the face fly is a much more successful pinkeye vector than the closely related house fly. In late fall, large numbers of face flies may enter buildings or similar structures to hibernate through the winter months. On warm days, hibernating flies can become active resulting in nuisance to homeowners. When active, face flies are attracted to light, so they are frequently found flying inside homes near windows. Management of Face Flies To control adult face flies within the home, locate where the flies are hibernating (overwintering). Begin searching for hibernation sites on the southern and western sides of the building because in fall and winter these walls receive the most sun and, therefore, are usually the warmest parts of the building and attract the greatest number of flies. Face flies seeking shelter will often enter cracks and crevices that lead to structural voids within a building, such as crawl spaces, attics, or false ceilings. These structural voids may need to be inspected if adult face flies persist throughout the winter. Flies can be vacuumed off the surfaces on which they are hibernating; in areas inaccessible to vacuuming, a residual insecticide such as a pyrethroid can be applied. For application of residual insecticides, contact a reputable pest control company. To prevent future infestations, cracks on the outside of the building structure that serve as entry points for flies should be sealed. For most fly species, the best control is achieved by removing larval developmental sites. Because face flies develop in fresh, undisturbed cattle manure (intact manure pats), removal of larval developmental sites (i.e., removal of intact manure pats) may be very difficult and probably impractical in most circumstances. However, by increasing the density of cattle (generally accomplished by restricting their pasture area), the manure pats will be disturbed by the animals as they forage, allowing few flies to develop. Alternatively, removal of cattle from nearby fields or pastures may help to reduce the problem. STABLE FLY Identification and Life Cycle The stable fly (Stomoxys calcitrans), sometimes called the \"biting fly,\" is a common fly that attacks people living in neighborhoods where livestock (e.g., horses, cattle) or livestock facilities are present. Stable flies typically appear in mid-late spring, become severe in early summer, and decrease in numbers throughout the remaining summer months when daytime temperatures are high. These flies are similar in appearance to house flies, except that stable flies have a bayonet-like mouthpart (proboscis) protruding from the front of the head; and they lack the four dark stripes on the thorax that are indicative of house flies. Under optimal temperatures, the stable fly can develop from egg to adult in 12 days. In addition to developing in the manure of livestock, piles of moist, decaying plant material (e.g., grass clippings, hay, silage) are also potential sources of stable flies, especially when this material is mixed with animal manure and urine. Backyard compost piles can be ideal developmental sites for stable fly larvae and may serve as the production source for an entire neighborhood. Damage Both sexes of stable flies feed about once per day on the blood of animals (and sometimes people) and are known to give a painful bite. Although they are blood feeders and capable of transmitting some viruses, stable flies are not known to be significant carriers of disease agents in the United States. Stable flies prefer to feed on the legs and lower body of cattle, horses, and other large animals (including humans). On dogs or similar sized animals, stable flies typically feed around the periphery of the ears earning them another common name \"dog flies.\" Undisturbed, a stable fly can fully engorge with blood in less than 5 minutes. Fully fed stable flies will move to a nearby resting site (e.g., a wall or fence) while the blood meal is digested. Management of Stable Flies The most effective and economical method for reducing stable fly numbers is to eliminate their developmental sites. To prevent larval development, moist grass clippings should be removed or incorporated into compost piles. Compost piles must be properly maintained to prevent them from becoming breeding areas for stable flies. Proper maintenance includes periodically turning the pile, which promotes internal heating of the pile and rapid decomposition of the organic matter within the pile. To protect dogs and horses that are bothered by stable flies, insect repellents containing permethrin or pyrethrins are effective but neither provides long-term control; repeated applications every other day are necessary. Because the stable fly season is relatively short (late spring through early summer), this chemical repellent approach may be the most economical method to control stable flies on companion animals. BLOW FLIES Identification and Life Cycle Blow flies are a group of fly species with similar life histories and behaviors. Adult flies in this group can be readily differentiated from other flies discussed in this publication by their coloration, which is a shiny, metallic green or blue often mixed with some copper color. The term \"blow fly\" comes from the association of many of these fly species with carrion (dead animals) on which some species will deposit their eggs; however, in the urban environment the most common developmental site for these flies is in human food waste, though accumulations of pet waste may also produce these flies. Under ideal temperatures, blow flies can develop from egg to adult in as little as 7 days. Similar to other nuisance flies, blow fly larvae leave their developmental site to seek out drier and more protected areas for pupation. Many homeowners have witnessed this behavior as a mass emergence of maggots crawling from their backyard trash cans when kitchen waste placed in these trash cans was not sealed in a plastic trash bag. Blow fly larvae and house fly larvae look and behave similarly, making identification difficult for the untrained. Damage Like house flies, blow flies have sponging mouthparts and do not bite or feed on blood. They are, however, strongly attracted to human foods and garbage, making cooking outdoors difficult where they are present. As with house flies, they may be involved in the transmission of disease agents acquired from garbage or animal feces and subsequently deposited onto human foods. Management of Blow Flies As with the other nuisance fly species, removal of larval developmental sites is the most efficient means of control. Household garbage and pet feces should be placed in plastic garbage bags and sealed before being deposited into trash containers outside the home. Garbage cans should be set out for pickup at least once each week, even if they are not full; because garbage that sits for more than one week is likely to produce adult blow flies. Finally, garbage cans should be regularly washed out with soap and water to remove any garbage residues that might attract blow flies or allow for their development. Vertically hanging, sticky fly ribbons used to reduce adult house fly numbers will not work to control adult blow flies; unlike house flies, blow flies do not regularly rest on vertical surfaces. Adult blow flies can be controlled using odor-baited traps, as for house flies; but traps should be placed at some distance from the home or structure due to their foul odor. Selective use of insecticides may be considered when sanitation measures fail to control fly problems. Fly baits used for control of house flies are not likely to provide good control of blow flies because the attractants present in fly baits were designed to attract house flies rather than blow flies. However, when placed on the ground surrounding trash containers, some control may be obtained. SUMMARY Almost all nuisance fly species are best controlled by eliminating larval developmental sites and reducing adult attractants in the vicinity of buildings or other areas of concern. Attractive material (such as garbage cans) should always be placed at some distance from a building entrance; and barriers such as screens, doors, and air curtains should be used to prevent flies from entering buildings. Chemicals are only rarely required for fly management in residential situations. Their use generally leads only to short-term control because they target adult flies, leaving immature developmental sites unchanged and available to produce the next generation of adult flies.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Cat fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, are the most common ectoparasite on domestic cats and dogs (Figure 1). Dog fleas, C. canis,look like cat fleas but are rare in California. Sticktight fleas, Echidnophaga gallinacea, are commonly found on ground squirrels and poultry; the females firmly attach themselves along the ears and eyes of their host (Figure 2). They can become a problem with pets that roam. The ground squirrel flea, Oropsylla montana, is found on ground squirrels and is the vector of sylvatic plague in California. However, fleas on cats or dogs in California most likely are cat fleas. Adult fleas are no larger than 1/8 inch long, so it is difficult to see a number of the characteristics used to describe them. These reddish-brown, wingless insects are laterally compressed, so they look as if they are walking on edge. Cat fleas have both pronotal and genal combs. They have piercing-sucking mouthparts through which they obtain blood meals from their hosts. Recent advances in molecular research indicate cat fleas are capable of transmitting a murinelike typhus disease in humans, cat flea rickettsiosis. The symptoms are similar to murine typhus but less severe, including headaches, chills, fever, vomiting, and rash. This rickettsial agent is widely found in cats and cat fleas worldwide. It is likely that many previously diagnosed cases of murine typhus actually might have been cat flea rickettsiosis. Fleabites consist of a small, central, red spot surrounded by a red halo, usually without excessive swelling. They usually cause minor itching but can become increasingly irritating to people with sensitive or reactive skin. Some people and pets suffer from fleabite allergic dermatitis, characterized by intense itching, hair loss, reddening of the skin, and secondary infection. Just one bite can initiate an allergic reaction, and itching can persist up to 5 days after the bite. Cat fleas serve as intermediary hosts of dog and cat tapeworms. Cats or dogs can acquire this intestinal parasite while grooming themselves if they ingest adult fleas that contain a cyst of the tapeworm. Children occasionally can acquire these tapeworms too.",
    "life_cycle": "Unlike most fleas, adult cat fleas remain on the host where feeding, mating, and egg laying occur. Females lay about 20 to 50 eggs per day. Cat flea eggs are pearly white, oval, and about 1/32 inch long (Figure 3). The eggs are smooth and readily fall from the pet and land on surfaces such as bedding and carpeting in the animal’s environment. They hatch in about 2 to 5 days. Flea larvae are no larger than 3/16 inch long, hairy, and wormlike with a distinct, brownish head but no eyes or legs (Figure 4). The larvae feed on dried blood and excrement adult fleas produce while feeding on the pet. Larval development is restricted to protected places where there is at least 75% relative humidity. The larvae feed and crawl around for 8 to 15 days before building small, silken cocoons in which they pupate and develop into adults. Debris, such as pet hair or skin or carpet fibers, usually covers the pupae, providing visual camouflage. Flea larvae develop more quickly at higher temperatures, preferring areas that are 70° to 90°F. At cool temperatures, fully formed fleas can remain in their cocoons for up to 12 months. Warm temperatures and mechanical pressure caused by walking on or vacuuming carpet stimulate emergence from the cocoon. At normal room temperatures, the entire life cycle can occur in about 18 days. An adult cat flea generally lives about 30 to 40 days on the host. When normal grooming activity is restricted, 85% of adult females survived for 50 days. You can find fleas on pets throughout the year, but numbers tend to increase dramatically during spring and early summer when conditions favor larval development.",
    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "New, safer, and more effective products aimed at controlling adult fleas on pets have made cat flea management without pesticide sprays, shampoos, and dusts feasible in most situations. Management of fleas on pets must occur in conjunction with regular, thorough cleaning of pet resting areas indoors and out. Once fleas infest a home, control will require a vigilant program that includes vacuuming, eliminating fleas on pets, and cleaning up and possibly treating shaded outdoor locations where pets rest. Several types of products are available to control fleas on dogs and cats. The newer products are either applied topically to the body of the pet or provided orally (Table 1). Products containing fipronil, permethrin, or amitraz also are designed to control ticks. Products containing the insect growth regulators (IGRs) methoprene and pyriproxyfen are designed to provide long-term control of flea eggs and immatures in the environment. If you administer oral or topical products early in the year before flea populations begin to build, the products can prevent fleas from establishing themselves in your home. Contact your veterinarian for advice in selecting the best flea-control product for your situation. Supplement the use of these products with good housekeeping in areas where the pet rests. If your home is heavily infested with fleas, take these steps to get the situation under control. Inside the Home Locate heavily infested areas, and concentrate efforts on these areas. Wash throw rugs and the pet’s bedding. Vacuum upholstered furniture. Remove and vacuum beneath cushions and in cracks and crevices. Vacuum carpets, especially beneath furniture and in areas that pest frequent. Use a hand sprayer to treat all carpets with an insecticide that contains an insect growth regulator. Allow carpets to dry, then vacuum a second time to remove additional fleas the spray caused to emerge. Continue to vacuum for 10 days to 2 weeks to kill adult fleas that continue to emerge from pupal cocoons. On the Pet Use a spot-on or a systemic oral treatment, which you can purchase from veterinarians or online. Outside the Home If you treat your pets with spot-on or oral treatments, you‘ll rarely need to spray outdoors.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Fleas are annoying to people and pets, especially during spring and early summer when their numbers tend to increase dramatically. The common flea in California is the cat flea. Despite its name, this flea attacks both dogs and cats and will also bite humans. To keep fleas out of your home, control fleas on your pet and regularly clean pet sleeping areas. On the pet: A number of very effective and safe products for flea control on the pet are available. You must supplement pet treatments with regular cleaning of your home and periodic combing with a pet flea comb to detect new infestations. Spot-on formulations are applied to the animal's coat. Use as directed on the label. These are a vailable from veterinarians, over-the-counter, or online. System ic flea control products, available from vets, are given as a pill or food treat . Flea collars containing imidacloprid and flumethrin are effective against fleas and ticks. Collars with insect growth regulators (IGRs) affect eggs and immature fleas. Be sure to choose collars containing methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Flea shampoos and soaps, powders and dusts, spray-on liquids, and dips are less effective and more hazardous to pets, people, and the environment than the three types of products above. In the yard: Outdoor treatments are occasionally needed. If your pet regularly sleeps outside and flea numbers are high, these areas can be treated with a spray containing pyriproxyfen. If possible, open sleeping areas to sunlight by removing low hanging vegetation. Immature fleas are unlikely to survive in areas with exposure to sunlight. Some wild animals can lead to outdoor flea problems as well, including feral cats, opossums, squirrels, and coyotes, so measures to limit their presence are important. Inside the home: Whether or not you are aware of fleas in your home, regularly vacuum and launder areas where your pet rests . If you have a major flea problem, treat your pet with one of the options above and follow the steps below. Locate heavily infested areas (usually areas where the pet rests) and concentrate treatment there. Wash throw rugs and pet bedding. Vacuum upholstered furniture, cleaning under cushions and in crevices. Vacuum carpets, especially beneath furniture. Use a hand sprayer or aerosol to treat all carpets and unwashable upholstered furniture with an insecticide that contains an IGR (methoprene or pyriproxyfen). This treatment kills larvae but not pupae, so fleas may continue to emerge for up to 2 weeks. Over the next 2 weeks, vacuum regularly to remove adult fleas that emerge from pupae. Do not reapply pesticides. Seal vacuum bags and discard them so fleas don't escape. ",

    "name": "False Chinch Bug",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES//pn74153.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "The false chinch bug, Nysius raphanus (Hemiptera: Lygaeidae), is a small insect commonly found within grassy or weedy fields, pastures, and foothills. Each spring, once the plants in these areas dry up, the false chinch bug migrates to find new places to feed. This becomes a nuisance for homeowners when these bugs migrate into their landscapes and homes and can cause problems for gardeners and farmers. False chinch bug problems often are most serious in years with wet, cool springs. Above average rainfall encourages abundant growth of weeds and grasses in areas with natural vegetation. Relatively cool spring and early summer weather prolongs the survival of these plants, resulting in greater increases in false chinch bug populations, which reproduce on this vegetation. Adults are grayish-brown, slender, and about 1/8 to 1/6 inch long. Like many other insects in the order Hemiptera, their forewings are partly thickened and partly membranous so when folded, the tips of the wings overlap, forming a fairly well-defined X on the back of the body (Figure 1). Immature stages (nymphs) lack wings and, from a distance, look like individual coffee grounds in size and color. Nymphs are a mottled gray brown often with reddish or orangish markings on the abdomen (Figure 2). Both immature and adult false chinch bugs feed on plants through a proboscis, a hypodermic-needlelike structure they use to probe into plant tissue and drink up plant fluids. This type of feeding can cause severe damage to plants that are unable to compensate for lost leaf tissue and sap. Don’t confuse false chinch bugs with other similar-looking bugs in the same family, the seed bug family Lygaeidae. Bigeyed bugs, which are wider and have larger eyes, are beneficials that feed on pest insects and mites (Figure 3). These never occur in abundance as do false chinch bugs. Another Lygaeid, the southern chinch bug, Blissus insularis, sometimes feeds on turfgrass, but rarely does it significantly damage lawns in California, except for St. Augustine grass. Adults of this species are black with whitish wings.",
    "life_cycle": "False chinch bugs spend the winter as nymphs and adults, usually in uncultivated areas beneath debris or in plants, often feeding on mustards or other winter annual plants. As new spring plant growth increases, so do populations of false chinch bugs. Adults lay eggs in soil cracks or loose soil around plants. After hatching, nymphs feed on weeds, especially mustards, molt three times, and develop into adults in about three weeks. There can be several generations a year. As weedy mustards and other cruciferous plants dry out and die, false chinch bugs move into irrigated crops or landscapes. Adults are good flyers and can move significant distances. False chinch bugs tend to aggregate in large groups on plants or on walls of houses. ",
    "damagePestNote": "In normal years, false chinch bugs are considered a pest only of seedlings. Plants might wilt but only rarely die. Larger annual plants and established perennials have sufficient size to be relatively unaffected by attacks against them. However, when populations are high in wet years, the sheer numbers of these pests can cause alarm for farmers and homeowners alike. Homeowners have been particularly hard hit, as waves of these insects completely envelop garden and landscape plants. Some homeowners have stated that it appears as if the ground is moving. Also, small false chinch bugs often are able to get underneath sliding screen patio doors and enter into homes, where they become a nuisance. In rare situations, aggregations of false chinch bugs can result in plant and tree decline, and there have been reports of these bugs killing young almond, pistachio, pomegranate, and citrus trees. This level of damage typically is reported only from the lower San Joaquin Valley. Initial symptoms include wilting and a scorched appearance to the leaves, followed by total plant death; the constant probing and feeding from this pest essentially can suck young trees dry. The decline of young trees often is so rapid many entomologists have hypothesized the false chinch bug injects a toxin into the plant as part of the feeding process. ",
    "managementPestNote": "There are few management options for the false chinch bug in gardens and landscapes. Low numbers do not need to be managed, because most garden plants can tolerate some feeding. Keep plants well irrigated to compensate for loss of sap due to chinch bug feeding. If your garden is near an uncultivated area with a lot of mustard, you might want to consider using row covers or caps to protect vegetable seedlings until migration had ended. Usually the mass migration lasts only one week at most. These insects move predominantly in the cooler mornings or late evenings, so water sprinkling can help reduce movement during these two periods. Creating a water moat around gardens also can reduce insect infestation. Prevent entry into houses by making sure screens on windows and patio doors are intact and sealing up other entryways. Some pest control companies or homeowners will apply a pesticide around the perimeter of the house to keep the bugs out. However, these products have very short residual, meaning they can save you from insects in your yard today but have little effect on those that arrive tomorrow. A better approach is to seal up entryways. If bugs get into houses, vacuum them up. On-pet Flea Treatment Products. New product innovations have made it possible to effectively, conveniently, and safely prevent flea populations from building up on pets. These products are more effective than the traditional insecticide collars, dusts, shampoos, and sprays. The spot-on formulations available from veterinarians or via the Internet are much easier to use than baths or sprays and are more acceptable to the animal and pet owner. A few drops of the spot-on formula applied to the animal’s shoulder blades move through the animal’s coat or are absorbed into the animal’s skin, providing whole-body treatment. These materials kill adult fleas within hours of the flea jumping on the animal. Also, these compounds have lower toxicity to mammals than traditionally used flea-control products containing carbamates such as carbaryl and propoxur and organophosphates such as chlorpyrifos, diazinon, and tetrachlorvinphos, making them safer to use on pets. Generally spot-on formulations can withstand bathing; check the label for specific instructions. There is no literature concerning the effectiveness of over-the-counter spot-on formulations. With increased EPA concerns about adverse effects reported with the use of topical flea control products, it should emphasized that not all products are safe for all animals. Products containing permethrin and amitraz never should be applied to cats. Be sure to read labels carefully. Systemic Oral Treatments. Three flea-control products are internal medications administered as a pill or chewable food. The insect development inhibitor lufenuron (Program) can be given as a pill to dogs or as a food additive for cats once a month to suppress flea populations. It also can be administered as an injection every 6 months. While this compound doesn’t kill adult fleas, it does prevent flea reproduction. Administration of nitenpyram (Capstar) provides rapid knockdown of the fleas on the host within 30 minutes. The effects last about 48 hours. A newer product for dogs containing spinosad (Comfortis) also is fast acting, providing protection for 60 days. These oral treatments are especially appropriate for animals that swim or take frequent baths. Flea Collars. Flea collars typically contain the IGRs methoprene and pyriproxyfen and insecticides such as permethrin and tetrachlorvinphos. The collar releases the IGR, which then distributes itself throughout the pet’s coat affecting eggs and female adult fleas. Very little information has been published concerning the efficacy of collars. Traditional Insecticide Products. Until recently, pet owners had to rely on products containing conventional insecticides (pyrethrins, permethrin, d-limonene, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, carbaryl, and naled) to control fleas on their pets. These products were formulated as soaps, shampoos, powders, dusts, spray-on liquids, and dips. Although many of these products still are available, they aren’t as effective to use as the on-animal treatments above. Some products aren’t labeled for cats. Be sure to read all labels carefully. Nonchemical Treatments. Special metal flea combs are available that help effectively remove adult fleas from the coat of pets. Removing fleas can provide comfort to the animal and reduce flea breeding. Combing pets at regular intervals also is a good way to monitor the flea population and help you decide when other control measures might be necessary. Studies have shown that neither Vitamin B1 (thiamine hydrochloride) supplements nor brewer’s yeast prevents fleas from feeding. Herbal collars and ultrasonic devices aren’t effective flea repellents either. Indoors. Controlling cat fleas in buildings requires a variety of approaches. Before starting a control program, look through each room to determine areas where larval development occurs. Flea populations are highest in places where dogs or cats regularly sleep. You usually won’t find flea larvae in areas of heavy pedestrian traffic or locations that receive exposure to sunlight; they are likely to be present in areas where adult fleas have left dried blood and feces. Sanitation. Thoroughly and regularly clean areas where you find adult fleas, flea larvae, and flea eggs. Vacuum floors, rugs, carpets, upholstered furniture, and crevices around baseboards and cabinets daily or every other day to remove flea eggs, larvae, and adults. Vacuuming is very effective in killing larvae in the carpet, picking up adults, and stimulating preemerged adults to leave their cocoons. Recent studies suggest that destroying the vacuum bags isn’t necessary. Launder pet bedding in hot, soapy water at least once a week. Thoroughly clean items you bring into the building, such as used carpets or upholstered furniture, to prevent these from being a source of flea infestation. Insecticides. Several insecticides are registered for controlling fleas indoors. The most effective products also contain the IGR methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Use a hand sprayer or aerosol to apply insecticides directly to infested areas of carpets and furniture. Total release aerosols, or room foggers, don’t provide the coverage and long-term effectiveness of direct sprays unless they contain methoprene or pyriproxyfen. Treatments with insecticides other than IGRs often fail to control flea larvae, because the treatment material fails to contact them at the base of carpet fibers where they develop. Spray carpets, pet sleeping areas, carpeted areas beneath furniture, baseboards, windowsills, and other areas harboring adults or larvae. Fleas will continue to emerge for about 2 weeks after treatment, because the spray doesn’t kill pupae. Continue to vacuum, and don’t treat again for at least several weeks. Outdoors. In California, outdoor flea populations are most prevalent in coastal localities and other places with moderate daytime temperatures and fairly high humidity levels. In Central Valley locations, populations can become very numerous in shaded and protected areas such as sheltered animal enclosures, crawl spaces under buildings where feral animals might sleep, and vegetated areas adjacent to buildings. Infested outdoor locations left untreated can lead to fleas reinfesting your pets. However, treating the pet with any of the preferred pet treatment products listed above normally will prevent reinfestation. Outdoor sprays aren’t necessary unless you detect significant numbers of adult fleas. One way to do this is to walk around pet resting areas wearing white socks pulled up to the knee. If fleas are present, they will jump onto socks and be readily visible. Products for eliminating adult fleas outdoors are somewhat limited because many field populations of cat fleas are resistant to pyrethroids such as permethrin. Apply sprays directly in locations where pets rest and sleep such as doghouse and kennel areas, beneath decks, and next to the foundation. It is seldom necessary to treat the entire yard or lawn areas. Flea larvae are unlikely to survive in areas with exposure to sunlight or substantial foot traffic.",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Control of eye gnats requires an all-encompassing approach targeting primarily larval development sites while also monitoring and in some cases managing adults. Temporary relief from eye gnats can be achieved by using the same repellents used for other nuisance pests such as mosquitoes (e.g., products containing the chemical DEET or picaridin). The most effective control measures are cultural and physical, but mass trapping to remove large numbers of flies has also been used by vector control districts. Chemical control of eye gnats has been relatively ineffective in agricultural settings, due to insecticide resistance and the difficulty of reaching larvae beneath the soil with pesticide applications. If populations of eye gnats are very high around the home, applications of insecticides to turf, or to the surrounding landscape where adult eye gnats settle, may be effective in temporarily reducing the number of adult flies. Although there are beneficial parasites and predators of larvae and pupae, they are not effective in reducing eye gnat populations, and there are no commercially available biological control agents for this pest. Cultural and Physical Control The most effective control has been cultural and mechanical control at breeding sites, often on farms located some distance from homes, schools, and recreational areas where flies are bothering people. However, homeowners can use some cultural and physical methods to reduce an eye gnat nuisance. For instance, eye gnats are attracted to, and reproduce in, fresh organic matter turned into the soil. Therefore, reduce the incorporation of organic matter into your soils and flowerbeds. In addition, the soil needs to be moist, so reducing the amount of moisture or irrigation, especially to the soil surface, will help reduce egg laying and larval survival. Physical exclusion includes the use of insect exclusion screens or netting as a barrier or enclosure, which can be used as an option if eye gnats become unmanageable. Research has shown that more than 90% of the eye gnats can be excluded from an area using a screen fence or barrier that is 8 feet high, because eye gnats tend to fly close to the ground. Trapping Trapping can provide some relief from eye gnats when coupled with the use of repellents. Traps also can help determine the presence and relative population levels of eye gnats in the surrounding environment. An eye gnat trap can be made by homeowners, gardeners, and landscapers with eggs (bait), a 2-liter plastic bottle, a 1-gallon container, and a knife or 3/4-inch drill bit:\tIn the 1-gallon empty plastic container, crack 4 eggs, fill the container with water, and mix thoroughly. Use the egg-bait solution immediately, refrigerating any that remains after filling the traps.\tCut or drill three to four holes into the upper third of the 2-liter plastic bottle.\tNote that traps with the lower portion painted flat black are more effective.\tFill the 2-liter plastic bottle one fourth to one third full with the egg-bait solution.\tHang the trap 2 to 3 feet from the ground, placing the trap away from windows, doors, and patios of homes or work areas.\tCheck the trap at least once a week to make sure that there is still sufficient wet bait to catch files.\tIt has been shown that two-week-old egg bait becomes ineffective. Therefore, remove the contents of the trap, clean, and refill at least every 14 days, or more often if possible. During hot periods, the water will evaporate and the bait will harden. If this occurs, add new egg bait as necessary.\tChemical Control Insecticides are rarely, if ever, warranted to control these flies around homes. However, if you do apply an insecticide for eye gnats, consider using pyrethrins or spinosad, which research has shown are effective against adult eye gnats. Eye gnat adults tend to spend most of their time in turf and flowerbeds when the populations are high, so treating these plants may reduce adult populations on site. Insecticide treatments to kill larval populations in the soil are ineffective, but drying soils out will reduce egg laying and adult emergence. If populations of eye gnats on your property are very high, call your local county vector control district.",

    "damagePestNote": "Adult beetles and larvae chew semicircular holes or irregular notches along edges of eucalyptus leaves. The beetles can remove most of a leaf’s surface, leaving only the midvein, and they occasionally feed on new terminal growth. Unsightly, tattered leaves are usually just an annoyance that does not appear to threaten eucalyptus survival or health. During heavy infestations, trees can lose most of their leaves, which increases tree stress. Although these beetles alone are not known to kill trees, their feeding adds to that of more than a dozen other new eucalyptus pests introduced into California during the last three decades. Combined stress from multiple pests, especially if growing conditions or tree care practices are not optimal, could eventually lead to tree death. Chrysophtharta m-fuscum is a serious pest of commercially grown Baby Blue eucalyptus (Eucalyptus pulverulenta). Baby Blue, also called silverleaved mountain gum, is used as fresh cut foliage in flower arrangements, or it is dried, dyed, and sold in preserved arrangements. The eucalyptus species preferences of these tortoise beetles have not been well documented. However, certain tree species are apparently preferred or avoided by these beetles and other major eucalyptus pests, as summarized and compared in Table 1.",
    "managementPestNote": "Eucalyptus trees are attacked by several other types of insects, including eucalyptus longhorned borers, several psyllids, and more innocuous species such as the lemongum gall wasp (Epichrysocharis burwellii). For more information on these pests, see the Pest Notes listed in References. Some eucalyptus insects are now under good biological control, including eucalyptus snout beetle, bluegum psyllid (Ctenarytaina eucalypti), and (increasingly at least in Southern California) the redgum lerp psyllid. Learn how management efforts may affect these introduced pests before taking any actions against these leaf-feeding beetles (See sidebar.). Provide trees with good cultural care and avoid actions that are harmful to the natural enemies of any of these eucalyptus pests. Cultural Control Minimize tree stress by providing eucalyptus trees with proper cultural care and protecting them from injury. Depending on the situation, consider providing trees with supplemental water during periods of prolonged drought, such as during summer and fall in much of California. Some eucalyptus species are drought tolerant, but others require supplemental moisture. If irrigating, avoid the frequent, shallow watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate eucalyptus trees infrequently (possibly once a month during drought periods) but with sufficient amounts so the water penetrates deeply into the soil (1 foot or more below the surface). This can be achieved by applying water slowly through drip emitters that run continuously for several days. In areas without an established irrigation system, a water tank truck can be used to temporarily flood soil. However, avoid prolonged waterlogging, especially around the root crown, because eucalyptus trees are susceptible to pathogens that cause Armillaria root rot and Phytophthora root rot, which are favored by wet soils. The specific amount and frequency of water needed vary greatly depending on the site and tree species. In addition, if a tree has been irrigated regularly, avoid prolonged interruptions to watering, particularly during the summer when insect pests are most active. Avoid fertilizing eucalyptus. Succulent new shoot growth stimulated by excess nitrogen can increase the population and damage of eucalyptus-feeding psyllids. Eucalyptus in landscapes rarely require nitrogen fertilization for good growth. A six-year study of river red gum found no significant effect on tree size or survival due to annual nitrogen application. If other plants within the drip line of the tree require fertilization, use slow-release nutrient formulations. Pest-Resistant Eucalyptus If planting eucalyptus, choose species that are well adapted to the location, including tolerance to the prevailing moisture conditions. Although certain eucalyptus trees are drought tolerant, other species are adapted to more moist conditions. It may not be apparent that eucalyptus trees are stressed due to drought or other factors until trees become affected by additional damaging influences, such as abundant insects. Be aware that a few species such as blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) have become invasive and other species may be better choices for planting. Consult Table 1 for a list of the approximate susceptibility of eucalyptus species to tortoise beetles, longhorned borers, and psyllids. Biological Control Eucalyptus tortoise beetles are not normally pests in their native home of Australia except in cultivated stands; presumably natural enemies there keep beetle populations low. During a period of several years, University of California scientists introduced an egg parasite (Enoggera reticulata), originally from Australia, into California in an effort to control Trachymela sloanei . This tiny wasp searches under eucalyptus bark and in cracks and fissures, laying its eggs in tortoise beetle eggs. The parasite larva feeds inside and kills the egg and, after pupating, emerges as an adult to seek and attack more beetle eggs. However, the parasite has not been recovered during field surveys in California, indicating the species probably has not become established. To date, no biological control research has been conducted for the newer pest, Chrysophtharta m-fuscum . The parasite Enoggera reticulata did establish and control another eucalyptus tortoise beetle species in South Africa, and several other eucalyptus pests have been controlled in California using introduced parasites. Chemical Control There is no published research conducted in landscapes on pesticide effectiveness for controlling eucalyptus tortoise beetles. Based on studies of these pests in field nurseries and eucalyptus stands, long–term control can be achieved by a soil drench application of the systemic neonicotinoid insecticides imidacloprid (Merit or Bayer Advanced 12-month Tree & Shrub Insect Control) or clothianidin (Arena—for commercial applicators only). Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides such as the carbamate carbaryl (Sevin) or pyrethroids, including cyfluthrin (Tempo) and permethrin (Astro, Dragnet), are not recommended for eucalyptus in landscapes because of concerns about drift, runoff into water, and toxicity to natural enemies. In comparison with these contact sprays, systemic neonicotinoid insecticides can be more effective and provide longer-lasting control, although they can take several weeks after application before they become effective. Eucalyptus trees are often very large and difficult to treat in landscapes. Many eucalyptus trees are stressed from other problems, and tree stress can reduce pesticide effectiveness as well as increase a tree’s sensitivity to damage by the pesticide (called phytotoxicity). If insect damage cannot be tolerated and pesticides must be applied, make sure trees are receiving good cultural care before making a pesticide application. Systemic Insecticides These insecticides are absorbed by plants (such as through roots) and move to the plant parts where pests feed. The systemic insecticide imidacloprid is available to both professional applicators (Imicide, Merit) and home gardeners (Bayer Advanced 12-month Tree & Shrub Insect Control). Soil applications and tree injections (if labeled for these methods of application) minimize environmental contamination. The home-use product is relatively easy to apply to soil; it is measured into a bucket, diluted with water, and poured onto soil near trunks, as directed on the label. Limit any treatments to situations where damage is intolerable or pests threaten tree survival. Most pesticides are at least somewhat harmful to beneficial predators or parasites. Imidacloprid applied to flowering plants or the soil beneath them may move to nectar and poison the nectar-feeding adult parasites, which during their larval stage partially or completely control other pests. Be aware that imidacloprid application may contribute to outbreaks of spider mites and other pests. When using systemic insecticides, whenever possible consider making a soil application instead of spraying foliage or injecting or implanting trees. Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. Especially avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Based on use against other pests, the most effective time to apply imidacloprid on or into soil beneath trees is late winter to early spring, just before or soon after new leaves emerge and before the end of California’s rainy season. Make an application before rainfall, or follow the application with irrigation. Efficacy is delayed until sometime after application. Because pesticide recommendations, registrations, labels, and products change regularly, check current product labels or contact the University of California Cooperative Extension in your county for the most current recommendations on the use of insecticides.",

    "damagePestNote": "Psyllid nymphs and adults feed by sucking plant phloem sap through their strawlike mouthparts. High redgum lerp psyllid populations secrete copious honeydew and cause premature leaf drop. Sticky honeydew, the resulting dark sooty mold growth, and falling leaves foul surfaces beneath infested trees. Extensive defoliation weakens trees, can increase tree susceptibility to damage from other insects and diseases affecting eucalyptus, and contributes to premature death of some highly susceptible species. At some locations, abundant yellowjackets feeding on honeydew may annoy or threaten people. Redgum lerp psyllid infests over two dozen Eucalyptus species. In California this psyllid prefers river red gum (Eucalyptus camaldulensis), flooded gum (E. rudis), and forest red gum (E. tereticornis). Certain Eucalyptus species are avoided or are not heavily infested by this psyllid (Table 1).",
    "managementPestNote": "The species of eucalyptus primarily determines whether psyllids will be abundant. Cultural practices and overall tree health also influence populations and the extent to which trees are damaged. Providing adequate irrigation and limiting nitrogen can reduce susceptibility to damage. An introduced, psyllid-specific parasitic wasp is providing substantial biological control on coastal area trees. Systemic insecticides have sometimes provided control, but efficacy has been variable and sometimes disappointing. Eucalyptus trees in California are attacked by at least 14 other introduced insects, including the bluegum psyllid\t(Ctenarytaina eucalypti), eucalyptus longhorned borers\t(Phoracantha recurva and P. semipunctata), and eucalyptus snout beetle or gumtree weevil (Gonipterus scutellatus), which are now under good biological control. Learn how management efforts may affect the other introduced eucalyptus pests before taking any control actions. In particular, consult the Pest Notes on eucalyptus longhorned borers, eucalyptus tortoise beetle, and psyllids . Monitoring Inspect valued eucalyptus regularly to detect problems with tree-growing environment and care as well as psyllids and their natural enemies. Don’t wait until infestations are severe to monitor trees because cultural practices such as changes in irrigation or nitrogen application are primarily preventive and must be applied early. Where severe psyllid infestations are intolerable, identify those trees, but consider delaying any pesticide application until the following winter or early spring. It may be unrealistic to expect good control from actions taken after pests become abundant. The number of lerp coverings is not a good indication of psyllid abundance. Some nymphs form multiple lerps and leave their old whitish covers empty. Other covers have small parasite emergence holes or harbor nymphs that are parasitized. Use yellow sticky traps to capture adult psyllids and parasitic wasps. Monitoring traps for adults is more efficient than inspecting foliage for immatures. There is a positive correlation between the number of psyllid nymphs and eggs on leaves and adult female psyllids caught in yellow sticky traps. Yellow sticky traps provide a strong indication of seasonal changes in psyllid and parasite activity. Be sure to keep records of natural enemy activity. Avoid spraying trees with high psyllid-specific parasitization rates.\nTable 1.

Dragonflies (Order Odonata) will hover near infested trees and catch adult psyllids in mid-air. Although predators do not provide complete biological control, they can reduce psyllid abundance. Whenever possible, select management efforts that have less adverse effects on these beneficial species. A psyllid-specific parasitic wasp\t(Psyllaephagus bliteus) that feeds only on redgum lerp psyllid has been introduced from Australia. Adult P. bliteus are about 1/12-inch-long encyrtid wasps with metallic green bodies and yellowish legs. At moderate temperatures, female parasites lay on average over 100 eggs during their 2-month life span. Females lay eggs in psyllid nymphs of any age, usually in third and fourth instars. Parasite larvae feed and develop only when nymphs reach the fifth (last) instar. After killing their host, wasps pupate and emerge, leaving a roundish emergence hole in parasitized psyllid nymphs and their lerp covers. Psyllaephagus bliteus has significantly reduced psyllid populations at coastal locations, especially in southern California. At warmer interior locations in California’s Central Valley, the parasite has not yet provided good biological control. Cultural Control Minimize stress by providing eucalyptus trees with proper cultural care and protecting them from injury. Consider providing trees with supplemental water during periods of prolonged drought, such as during summer and fall in much of California. Drought stress increases damage to trees from both lerp psyllids and eucalyptus longhorned borers. If irrigating trees, apply water beneath the outer canopy, not near trunks. Avoid frequent, shallow watering that is often used for lawns. A general recommendation is to irrigate eucalyptus trees infrequently (possibly once a month during drought periods) but with sufficient amounts so that the water penetrates deeply into soil (perhaps about 1 foot or more below the surface). This can be achieved by applying water slowly through drip emitters that run continuously for several days. In areas without an established irrigation system, a water tank truck can be used to temporarily flood soil. However, avoid prolonged water-logging, especially around the root crown, because eucalyptus trees are susceptible to pathogens favored by wet soils, such as Armillaria and Phytophthora root rots. The specific amount and frequency of water needed varies greatly depending on the site and tree species. Avoid fertilizing eucalyptus. Psyllid nymphs and egg-laying females prefer the abundant, succulent new shoot growth stimulated by excess nitrogen. Eucalyptus rarely require nitrogen fertilization for good growth. A six-year study of river red gum found no significant affect on tree size or survival due to annual nitrogen application. If other plants within the drip line of the tree require fertilization, use slow-release nutrient formulations. Consider pruning off limbs that overhang surfaces where dripping honeydew is especially intolerable. Be aware that pruning often stimulates new growth of succulent foliage, which is preferred by psyllids. Except for dead or hazardous branches, which should be removed whenever they appear, prune eucalyptus only during December or January (in southern California) or November through March (in northern California). Trees are usually less stressed at this time of the year and adult eucalyptus longhorned borers, which are attracted to fresh tree wounds, are not active. Do not prune too much during one season. If extensive limb removal is planned, space the trimming over several years so that trees maintain adequate foliage to produce food and extensive portions of previously shaded bark are not suddenly exposed to direct sunlight, which can result in sunburn cankers. Pest-Resistant Eucalyptus Choose eucalyptus species that are well adapted to the location, including tolerance to the prevailing moisture conditions. Although certain eucalyptus trees are drought-tolerant, other species are adapted to more moist conditions. It may not be apparent that eucalyptus trees are stressed due to drought or other factors until trees become affected by additional damaging influences, such as abundant insects. Planting resistant species can prevent redgum lerp psyllid from being a problem, as only a few species become highly infested. When selecting new or replacement species, also consider their susceptibility to other key pests. Consult Table 1 for a list of the approximate reported susceptibility to eucalyptus longhorned borers, redgum lerp psyllid, and tortoise beetle. Chemical Control Insecticide efficacy has been variable. Consider treating only those trees where the pest has been intolerable or tree health appears threatened by insects. Insecticides can adversely affect Psyllaephagus bliteus parasites and beneficial predators. Leave at least some nearby eucalyptus untreated to provide a refuge for natural enemies. Avoid treating trees in coastal areas where the natural enemy parasite is well established. Foliar sprays generally are not recommended. The lerp helps protect psyllid nymphs from spray contact. There are no selective insecticides that kill only psyllids. It is difficult to spray large urban trees without pesticide drifting off-target. If honeydew is intolerable and trees are small enough to be thoroughly sprayed, consider using a mixture of insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids) and horticultural oil (an insecticide labeled narrow-range, superior, or supreme oil). These low-hazard insecticides can be combined together at one-half of the labeled rate or the full labeled rate (commonly 1 to 2% active ingredient each). Oil and soap will kill some of the psyllid adults, eggs, and nymphs that are not covered by the lerps, and help to wash off honeydew. Oil and soap sprays are not highly effective against lerp psyllids and foliar spraying provides only temporary control. The most effective materials for large trees are systemic insecticides such as imidacloprid (Imicide, Merit). Certain formulations of imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Garden Tree & Shrub Insect Control and Pointer) are available to the home gardener. Limited research has been conducted on pesticide efficacy. Proper treatment timing is difficult to determine. It is not known why some users report good control with insecticide while others find disappointing results. Systemic insecticides are available for application into trunks or roots or by spraying foliage. Imidacloprid is also available to both home gardeners and professionals for application on or into soil beneath trees. When using systemics, whenever possible consider making a soil application instead of injecting or implanting trees. Injecting or implanting trunks or roots injures trees, and it is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth. Especially avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides are not recommended because of drift and negative impacts on natural enemies. Imidacloprid may be effective when applied to soil during late winter to early spring, or before rainfall or irrigation are expected to facilitate root absorption of the insecticide. Summer application to stressed, heavily infested trees is less likely to be effective and is not recommended.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Two closely related species of longhorned borer beetles (family Cerambycidae) attack eucalyptus trees in California. Phoracantha semipunctata, which is native to Australia, was introduced into Southern California in the 1980s. It rapidly became a pest and now appears throughout the state wherever eucalyptus trees grow. Natural enemies were introduced from Australia, and biological control combined with improved cultural care of eucalyptus have dramatically reduced the number of trees this borer kills each year. In 1995, a second species of longhorned borer, Phoracantha recurva, was discovered in Southern California in Los Angeles, Riverside, Orange, and San Bernardino counties. This beetle has spread throughout much of California wherever eucalyptus grows. However, biological control has been less effective against this new borer. P. recurva, along with several other new pests, can stress and kill eucalyptus. Freshly cut wood, dying limbs, and trees suffering from stress, especially drought stress, attract both of these beetles. Many eucalyptus trees in California grow in unmanaged or minimally managed environments with no irrigation. Eucalyptus species that grow in wetter areas of Australia have been planted in California, so when they experience prolonged dry periods, these species are especially susceptible to being attacked and killed by borers.",

    "damagePestNote": "Holes in the bark and stains or oozing liquid on limbs or trunks are common symptoms of longhorned borer damage. Foliage can discolor and wilt, and limbs can die back. Longhorned borers usually attack stressed or damaged plants, leaving vigorous, appropriately watered trees alone. In California, however, many eucalyptus trees are seasonally water stressed during hot summer months, rendering a significant proportion of them susceptible to beetle attack. Tree species with some resistance to these wood borers can produce copious amounts of resin in response to an attack. Extensive larval feeding beneath the bark can spread around the entire circumference of a tree, girdling, or completely removing a strip of bark from, the trunk. Trees at this stage of infestation have a thin canopy with wilted or dry leaves, and the bark is cracked and packed with larval excrement. Infested trees usually die within of a few weeks of girdling, although resprouting can occur from the tree base.",
    "managementPestNote": "You can use the same methods to manage both Phoracantha species—reduce tree stress, properly handle eucalyptus wood, plant resistant species, and avoid activities that disrupt biological control. Pesticide applications generally aren’t effective in managing these pests. Cultural Management Certain species of eucalyptus are more resistant to longhorned borers, especially those adapted to drier conditions (Table 2). Be aware that a few species such as blue gum (Eucalyptus globulus) have become invasive, and other species can be better choices for planting depending on the area you live in. Also, longhorned borers can attack any species of eucalyptus if trees are heavily stressed, such as when planted in poor soil or deprived of sufficient water. A well-maintained tree of a susceptible species can be at less risk of infestation than a neglected tree of a resistant species.\tTable 2.

M., T. D. Paine, J. G. Millar, and J. L. Hom. 1995. Variation among Eucalyptus species in resistance to eucalyptus longhorned borer in southern California. Entomologia Experimentalis et Applicata. 74:185–194.\nConsider providing supplemental water on a regular schedule during prolonged dry periods, particularly if seasonal rainfall has been below normal. If a tree has received regular irrigation, avoid prolonged interruptions to watering, particularly during the summer when insect pests are most active. Suddenly cutting off irrigation to trees that have been receiving water regularly will cause trees to become water stressed and susceptible to heavy attack. If irrigating, apply water to the ground below the edge of the outer canopy and not in close near the trunk. Avoid frequent, shallow watering, which often occurs for lawns. Such a watering schedule is likely to promote tree root disease. Eucalyptus logs used for firewood and dead or dying branches and trees are the beetles’ primary breeding sites. Sanitation is critical for reducing beetle numbers. Until the wood dries below a critical level, it remains highly attractive to egg-laying beetles. Anything you can do to speed the drying process, such as cutting and splitting wood and, even more importantly, removing bark from felled logs, helps reduce the length of time it can support beetle development. If infestation already has occurred, you should treat or destroy the wood. Bury, burn (where permitted), or chip infested eucalyptus. Chipped eucalyptus makes an excellent mulch. Alternatively, solarize wood by placing it in a sunny location and covering it with ultraviolet-resistant plastic. This prevents new beetles from attacking and resident beetles from emerging and flying to nearby living eucalyptus. You can store properly solarized wood for firewood. To solarize, tightly seal wood beneath thick (10 mil), clear plastic sheets in a sunny location for several months. To be effective, this treatment requires keeping wood piles small; using high-quality, clear plastic resistant that is to ultraviolet light degradation; thoroughly sealing the edges; and promptly patching holes to prevent beetles from escaping. For more information on solarization, see the publications by Donaldson and Seybold (1998) and Sanborn (1996) in References . OTHER EUCALYPTUS PESTS\tSeveral other introduced insects also attack eucalyptus. Pest managers should learn how management methods such as conserving natural enemies and planting resistant species can help control these pests, which include leaf-feeding beetles (tortoise beetles), eucalyptus gall wasps, and at least six species of psyllids.\tSome of these insects now are now under effective biological control, including the bluegum psyllid (Ctenarytaina eucalypti), the eucalyptus snout beetle or gumtree weevil (Gonipterus scutellatus), and especially in Southern California the eucalyptus redgum lerp psyllid (Glycaspis brimblecombei) . Inappropriate actions such as spraying persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides—those that remain in the environment at levels toxic to natural enemies for more than a few days—can harm natural enemies and can cause outbreaks of these other pests.\tFor more information, see: Pest Notes: Psyllids, Eucalyptus Redgum Lerp Psyllid, and Eucalyptus Tortoise Beetles .\tBiological Control Biological control with natural enemies has provided a partial solution to longhorned borer problems. At least one native California wasp, Helcostizus rufiscutum (Ichneumonidae), parasitizes P. semipunctata but only rarely; consequently, an egg parasite has been introduced from Australia for biological control. The wasps are highly specialized parasites, attacking only certain beetles. They present no threat to humans, pets, or livestock. By reducing beetle populations to a lower level, natural enemies have reduced borer damage, because vigorous trees can survive a few attacks. The egg parasite is Avetianella longoi (family Encyrtidae), a 1/16-inch-long, host-specific, introduced wasp that lays its eggs within the eggs of the beetles. Parasitized eggs develop brown shells through which you can observe the body and dark eye spots of developing wasps. A. longoi disperses rapidly and efficiently finds borer eggs. This wasp has become widely established in California, typically attacking and killing more than 90% of P. semipunctata eggs in the field. However, it is less effective against the more recently introduced P. recurva . Conserve parasites by avoiding the spraying of eucalyptus bark or foliage with broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. Chemical Control Early work from both California and other regions where beetles have become established indicated insecticides might not be suitable for managing eucalyptus longhorned borer populations, but more recent studies indicate newer, systemic insecticides (compounds that move within trees after being applied to the soil) might protect individual trees if applied before beetle colonization. Exercise care when using any insecticide, because of the potential for drift, environmental impact, effects on beneficial or nontarget insects, and risk of exposure to humans in urban environments.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca (=Pyrrhalta) luteola, is a leaf-chewing pest of elm trees, especially European elm species.

    "life_cycle": "The elm leaf beetle, Xanthogaleruca (=Pyrrhalta) luteola, is a leaf-chewing pest of elm trees, especially European elm species. American and most Asian elm species are less severely fed upon. Most Chinese elm cultivars, zelkova, and many newer elm cultivars are infrequently fed upon.",
    "damagePestNote": "Adults chew entirely through the leaf, often in a shothole pattern. Larvae skeletonize the leaf surface, causing damaged foliage to turn brown to whitish. Elm leaf beetles, when abundant, can entirely defoliate large elm trees, which eliminates summer shade and reduces the aesthetic value of trees. Repeated, extensive defoliation weakens elms, causing trees to decline. However, the elm leaf beetle has not been a significant, widespread problem in California since the 1990s.",
    "managementPestNote": "It is essential to correctly identify the cause of damaged elm leaves before taking management action. European flea weevil, Orchestes alni, also chews holes in elm leaves and causes elms to defoliate. This introduced beetle has become a serious elm pest in the eastern United States, but currently does not occur in California. Also from a distance, foliage severely chewed by beetles resembles the browning and dieback caused by Dutch elm disease fungi, Ophiostoma (= Ceratocystis) ulmi and O. novo-ulmi. Report any suspected Dutch elm disease, European flea weevil, or other new pests to the local county agricultural commissioner. Where the elm leaf beetle is a problem, manage it with an integrated program that incorporates good cultural practices, conservation of natural enemies, regular monitoring, and the use of less-persistent insecticides, bark banding, or systemic insecticide. Recognize that elm leaf beetle populations historically have fluctuated dramatically from year to year and trees do not warrant treatment most years. When management is warranted, use a combination of methods; because no single action improves the health of elm trees or kills 100% of the pests. Cultural Control Good cultural care of trees is an essential component of integrated pest management. American and European elm species are adapted to summer rainfall. Maintain tree vigor, and protect trunks and roots from injury, by providing appropriate irrigation in areas with summer drought. Check for dead or dying branches and promptly remove them. Dying branches pose a limb drop (failure) hazard and provide habitat for bark beetles, Scolytus multistriatus and S. schevyrewi, which vector the Dutch elm disease fungi. Avoid unnecessary pruning; and when pruning make cuts properly, preferably during late fall and winter and when trees are young. Choose species or cultivars that resist both Dutch elm disease and elm leaf beetle when planting (Table 1). Pest-resistant elms include Accolade, Emerald Sunshine, Frontier, Prospector, and most Chinese elms, except Dynasty. Control Action Guidelines Healthy elm trees can tolerate substantial damage to leaves; total defoliation may have little long-term effect on healthy elms, especially if leaf damage occurs late in the season. Suggested guidelines are to take action when needed to prevent greater than 40% defoliation (portion of leaf area chewed or leaves dropped prematurely); or if damage is less tolerable or occurring earlier in the growing season, a treatment threshold of 20% defoliation may be used. For additional information on how to predict the amount of defoliation from each beetle generation refer to the 1998 publication by Dahlsten and others listed in References. Timing of action varies according to the control methods and situation. To avoid unacceptable defoliation, when using methods that kill a smaller proportion of the pests or take longer to provide control allowing beetles to continue to feed and damage leaves, take action sooner than you would when using faster-acting methods. Monitoring Determine the need and effective timing for any pesticide application by visually inspecting leaves at about weekly intervals beginning in spring when the first generation of eggs and larvae are expected. Watch for the appearance of clusters of yellowish to gray eggs and caterpillar-like larvae. The calendar date of peak abundance and damage varies greatly from year to year depending on spring temperatures. If beetles are too abundant, use the heat accumulation method discussed in Degree-Day Monitoring to determine the optimal time to inspect foliage and to accurately time insecticide application. If you plan to spray foliage or apply systemic insecticide to trunks, make the application when first- and second-instar (small) larvae are abundant. With bark banding discussed below, band as soon as third-instar (larger) larvae are observed on leaves. If you drench or inject soil with a root-absorbed, systemic insecticide, the most effective application time is spring when elm trees flush new leaves or shortly after leaf flush. The time for action is before you know definitely whether beetles will become abundant enough to warrant this preventive application. Generally, insecticide application is unlikely to be warranted if:\tbeetles and damage were low during late summer the previous year;\tsystemic insecticide was properly applied the previous growing season; or\tthe winter was relatively warm or wet or both, because this weather apparently causes more “hibernating” beetles to die before elm leaves appear in spring.\tIf any of the above circumstances are true, avoid insecticide application unless monitoring of plants reveals that elm leaf beetles are present and excessively abundant. Degree-Day Monitoring Monitor temperatures to determine the optimal time to inspect elm leaves and (if beetles are too abundant) apply insecticide. Generally the higher the temperature, the sooner beetles and damage appear in the spring. When spring temperatures are cooler, elm leaf beetles appear later because they do not feed, grow, or reproduce below a “threshold temperature” of about 52°F. To predict the peak abundance of each elm leaf beetle life stage, temperatures are monitored in units called degree-days. One degree-day is 1 degree above the insect’s lower threshold temperature maintained for a full day. For the elm leaf beetle, degree-days above 52°F are accumulated for each season beginning March 1. The first- and second-instar larvae of first-generation elm leaf beetles are most abundant at about 700 degree-days above 52°F accumulated from March 1. If populations are high and damage is anticipated, foliar insecticide spray or trunk spray or injection of systemic insecticide at about 700 degree-days will catch susceptible larvae at their greatest abundance. Elm leaf beetle development can easily be predicted using the point-and-click, degree-day calculator online . If you manage large numbers of elms, you can further improve your treatment by using degree-days in combination with egg presence-absence sampling, as explained in the 1993 publication by Dahlsten and others listed in References . Biological Control Elm leaf beetle populations are usually low at least partly because of biological control by native predators and introduced parasites. Predators of the elm leaf beetle include certain bugs, earwigs, lacewing larvae, and predaceous ground beetles. The easiest to recognize parasite is a small black tachinid fly, Erynniopsis antennata . After Erynniopsis larvae feed inside and kill beetle larvae, the parasite’s 1/5 inch long, black to reddish pupae can be seen at the tree base among the yellowish, unparasitized beetle pupae. For more photographs of this beneficial fly, see the Natural Enemies Gallery . Adults of a tiny wasp, Oomyzus gallerucae (Eulophidae), feed on elm leaf beetle eggs; and the parasite’s larvae feed inside eggs. The Oomyzus adult leaves a round hole when it emerges from beetle eggs, which remain golden. When unparasitized and a beetle larva has emerged, the egg shell is whitish with a ragged hole. Another tiny eulophid wasp that kills beetle pupae, Baryscapus brevistigma, leaves one or more small round holes in the pupae and emerges from around the tree base. Conserve these parasites and predators by avoiding foliar applications of residual (long-lasting), broad-spectrum insecticides. To obtain maximum benefits from biological control, minimize pesticide application, use less-persistent products, or apply insecticide as a bark band in an integrated program. Chemical Control Where elm leaf beetle damage is anticipated to be intolerable, chemical controls include:\tfoliar spraying a nonresidual (nonpersistent) contact insecticide or a short-residual, translaminar insecticide\tbark banding, spraying bark with a residual, contact insecticide\tsystemic insecticide, which can be applied various ways\tA professional applicator must be hired to use certain methods. Monitor beetle abundance and damage, as discussed above, to determine treatment need, choice of method, and timing. Apply insecticide only when beetles are present or expected to become too abundant. Insecticides can have unintended effects, such as contaminating water, poisoning natural enemies and pollinators, and causing secondary pest outbreaks. Completely read and follow the product label instructions for the safe and effective use of the insecticide. Nonresidual, Contact Insecticides Where elm foliage can be thoroughly sprayed, nonresidual, contact insecticides can provide control. These can be useful on small trees, to supplement bark banding (discussed below), during the first year of treatment and when early-season beetle populations are high. Products include azadirachtin (AzaMax, Safer Brand BioNeem), neem oil (Green Light Neem, Schultz Garden Safe Brand Neem), narrow-range oil (Bonide Horticultural Oil, Monterey Horticultural Oil), and pyrethrins, which many products combine with piperonyl butoxide (Ace Flower & Vegetable Insect Spray, Garden Tech Worry Free Brand Concentrate). These insecticides have low toxicity to people and pets and relatively little adverse impact on pollinators and natural enemies. To obtain adequate control, spray must thoroughly cover the underside of infested leaves; and typically, foliage must be sprayed more than once per season. Short-Residual Insecticides. Spinosad is foliar sprayed, absorbed short distances into plant tissue (it has translaminar activity), and persists about 1 week. It can be easier to obtain control using spinosad in comparison with the products above. Spinosad (Captain Jack’s Deadbug Brew, Conserve, Monterey Garden Insect Spray) can be toxic to certain natural enemies (e.g., predatory mites, syrphid fly larvae) and bees when sprayed and for about 1 day afterward. Do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Bark Banding Spraying a small area around the tree trunk with a residual, contact insecticide kills larvae when they cross the treated bark and migrate down after feeding in the canopy. Bark banding reduces damage by later beetle generations by reducing the number of elm leaf beetles that pupate and emerge as adults, especially when done to all nearby elms. Bark banding alone will not provide satisfactory control in many situations, especially if only one or a few trees are treated. Expect good control during the first season of bark banding on Siberian elms (Ulmus pumila). When banding more susceptible species such as English and Scotch elms, expect little or no control the first year if beetles are abundant during the first generation; banding all nearby elms for several consecutive years can provide control after the first year of treatment. To bark band spray a several feet wide area encircling the trunk around the first main branch crotch. Carbaryl (Sevin) can be applied at the rate labeled for bark beetles (about 2% active ingredient). Pyrethroids (e.g., fluvalinate) labeled for application to bark also provide control. Bark banding may need to be done by a licensed pesticide applicator, because effective products generally are not available for home users. Do not use products labeled only for foliar application. The product will not be effective for trunk banding unless the label includes directions for application to bark. Inspect foliage regularly and spray bark when mature larvae are first observed on leaves. For more accurate timing, accumulate degree-days and spray the trunk when about 700 degree-days (above 52°F) have accumulated from March 1. A single application of carbaryl to the bark each spring can kill most larvae that crawl over it all season long. To determine if the bark band is still effective, regularly inspect around the base of trees throughout the season. If many beetles have changed from greenish prepupae (the stage killed by banding) to yellowish pupae (unaffected beetles), a second application may be warranted. Systemic Insecticides Systemic insecticides are absorbed by one plant part (e.g., trunks or roots) and moved (translocated) to leaves or other plant parts. In comparison with systemics that are sprayed onto foliage, products labeled for soil drench or injection or for trunk injection or spraying minimize environmental contamination and may be more effective. Trunk application of systemic insecticide can provide relatively rapid control. There is a longer time delay between soil application and insecticide action. Most uses require hiring a professional pesticide applicator. Some home-use products can easily be drenched into soil around the tree trunk using the mix-and-pour method. Systemic neonicotinoids include dinotefuran (Safari) and imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Tree & Shrub Insect Control, Merit). Properly applied, one application can provide season-long control. The insect growth regulator abamectin (Agri-Mek) and the organophosphate acephate (Lilly Miller Ready-to-Use Systemic, Orthene) are other available systemic insecticides. Some systemic insecticides can cause spider mite outbreaks. Foliar sprays of them can be toxic to beneficial insects that contact spray or treated leaves. Systemics can translocate into flowers and have adverse effects on natural enemies and pollinators that feed on nectar and pollen. However, elms are wind pollinated and most elm species flower before leaves flush and before the recommended times of insecticide application. Unless the product label directs otherwise, do not apply systemic insecticides to plants during flowering or shortly before flowering, wait until after plants have completed their seasonal flowering. With soil application, when possible, wait until nearby plants also have completed flowering as their roots may take up some of the soil-applied insecticide. If applying systemic insecticide, use soil application or a trunk spray whenever possible. It is difficult to repeatedly place insecticide at the proper depth with systemic injection and implants, and these methods injure trees and can spread plant pathogens on contaminated tools. When injecting or implanting multiple trees, before moving to work on each new tree, scrub any plant sap from tools or equipment that penetrate trees and disinfect tools with a registered disinfectant (e.g., bleach). At least 1 to 2 minutes of disinfectant contact time between contaminated uses is generally required. Consider rotating work among several tools and use a freshly disinfected tool while the most recently used tools are being soaked in disinfectant. Avoid methods that cause large wounds, such as implants placed in holes drilled in trunks. Do not implant or inject roots or trunks more than once a year. Residual, Foliar Sprays Foliar sprays of broad-spectrum insecticides with residues that can persist for weeks are not recommended for elm leaf beetle control. Products to avoid include carbamates (carbaryl or Sevin), nonsystemic organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (fluvalinate, permethrin). These are highly toxic to natural enemies and pollinators and can cause spider mite outbreaks. Because their use in landscapes and gardens can run or wash off into storm drains and contaminate municipal wastewater, these insecticides are being found in surface water and are adversely affecting nontarget, aquatic organisms.\tTable 1.

However, the striped earwig doesn’t damage plants.",
    "damagePestNote": "European earwigs feed on a variety of dead and living organisms, including insects, mites, and growing shoots of plants. They are voracious feeders on soft-bodied insects such as aphids and insect eggs and can exert significant biological control under some circumstances. In yards that are planted to turf and contain mature ornamental plants, damage by earwigs is unlikely to be of concern. European earwigs can cause substantial damage to seedling plants and soft fruit as well as to sweet corn. Damaged seedlings may be missing all or parts of their leaves and stem. Leaves on older plants, including fruit trees, have numerous irregular holes or are chewed around the edges. This damage may resemble that caused by caterpillars. Look for webbing, frass (excrement), or pupae that would indicate the presence of caterpillars. Earwigs may attack soft fruit such as apricots, strawberries, raspberries, or blackberries but don’t harm hard fruit such as apples. On stone fruit, look for shallow gouges or holes that extend deeply into the fruit. On strawberries, distinguish earwig damage from that of snails and slugs by checking for the slime trails snails and slugs leave behind. On corn, earwigs feed on silks and prevent pollination, causing poor kernel development. Earwigs may also seriously damage flowers including zinnias, marigolds, and dahlias. To confirm that earwigs are causing the damage, go out at night with a flashlight to observe the pests in action. Earwigs may seek refuge indoors when conditions outside are too dry, hot, or cold. Large accumulations of earwigs can be annoying but present no health hazards. Sweep or vacuum them up and seal entry points. Earwigs eventually die indoors because there is little for them to eat.",
    "managementPestNote": "Management of earwigs requires an integrated program that takes advantage of their habitat preferences. As moisture-loving insects, earwigs wouldn’t normally thrive in California’s arid climate without the moisture and shade provided by irrigated gardens. Where earwigs are a problem, consider reducing hiding places and surface moisture levels. Initiate a regular trapping program. If these measures are followed, insecticide treatments shouldn’t be necessary. Baits are available for earwigs but often aren’t very effective. Keep in mind that earwigs are omnivores and are beneficial in some situations, such as when they feed on aphids, and don’t need to be managed in many situations. Trapping A key element of an earwig management program is trapping. Place numerous traps throughout the yard, hiding the traps near shrubbery and ground cover plantings or against fences. A low-sided can, such as a cat food or tuna fish can, with 1/2 inch of oil in the bottom makes an excellent trap. Fish oil such as tuna fish oil is very attractive to earwigs, or vegetable oil with a drop of bacon grease can be used. These traps are most effective if sunk into the ground so the top of the can is at soil level. Dump captured earwigs and refill cans with oil. Other common types of traps are a rolled-up newspaper, corrugated cardboard, bamboo tubes, or a short piece of hose. Place these traps on the soil near plants just before dark and shake accumulated earwigs out into a pail of soapy water in the morning. Earwigs can also be dropped into a sturdy plastic bag and crushed. Continue these procedures every day until you are no longer catching earwigs. Sanitation and Other Controls Complement the trapping program by removing refuge sites for earwigs, such as ivy, weeds, piles of rubbish, and leaves. Never allow heavy ground cover such as ivy to grow near vegetable gardens. Watch out for mulches; they often harbor earwigs. Natural enemies including toads, birds, and other predators may play an important role in some gardens. Chickens and ducks will consume many earwigs. For fruit trees keep weeds, brush, and suckers away from the base of the trunk throughout the year, as this overgrowth provides refuge for earwigs. Monitor populations with folded newspapers or burlap bags placed at the base of trees. On the lower trunks of older fruit trees, carefully scrape off all loose bark. Trunks can be treated with Tanglefoot, a sticky substance that prevents earwigs from climbing up the trunks to reach ripening stone fruit. Also, keeping fruit trees properly pruned, thinning heavy crops, and picking fruit as soon as it ripens will help keep earwigs from becoming pests. Remember that earwigs can be beneficial in trees when they are feeding on aphids, so keeping them out isn’t always recommended unless the tree produces soft fruit. Chemical Control Where insecticides are desired, those containing spinosad (e.g., SluggoPlus baits or spinosad sprays) are the most effective, environmentally sound products. However, baits often aren’t very effective where there are other attractive food sources. Sprinkle baits around susceptible plants before they become infested or around the foundation of the house where earwigs may be entering. Dampening the bait after application may soften it and make it more attractive. Once earwigs are in susceptible plants or in fruit trees with ripening fruit, baits are unlikely to control the problem. Other more toxic insecticides are available, including carbaryl, but aren’t usually needed if the cultural practices above are followed. For best effect and to protect bees, apply at night and before the infestation is severe, following all label directions and making sure the product is labeled for use around any plants that may be treated. Combine the use of insecticides with the trapping and sanitation procedures described above. Inside the Home Indoors, earwigs can be swept or vacuumed up; be sure to kill and dispose of them promptly so they won’t reinvade. If earwigs are a regular problem in a building, inspect the area to see how they are getting into the house and seal up cracks and entry points. Remove materials outside the perimeter of the building that could provide harborage, such as ivy growing up walls, ground cover, bark mulches, debris (especially leaves in gutters), wood piles, leaf litter, piles of newspapers, or other organic matter. Also, keep water and moisture away from the structure by repairing drain spouts, grading the area so water drains away from the structure, and ventilating crawl spaces to minimize moisture. Insecticide treatments indoors aren’t recommended, since they will do little to prevent invasions. If earwigs are attracted to outdoor lighting, use yellow or sodium vapor lightbulbs, which are less attractive to these insects.",

    "contentQuickTips": "While their prominent tail-end pincers might look ferocious, earwigs aren’t harmful to people. Earwigs can seriously damage seedling vegetables and chew holes in annual flowers, soft fruit, and corn silks, but earwigs also play a beneficial role by feeding on aphids and other insects. Earwigs feed at night and hide during the day in dark, cool, moist places in the yard or within flowers or vegetables. To manage earwigs, reduce hiding places and moisture, and employ a vigilant trapping program. Should you be concerned about earwigs in your garden? Yes, if you are growing vegetables, herbaceous flowering plants, sweet corn, or plants with soft fruits such as strawberries and apricots. No, if your garden is primarily lawn, trees, and woody ornamentals or native plants. Reduce outdoor hiding places. Eliminate dense undergrowth of vines, ground cover, and weeds around vegetable and flower gardens. Prune away fruit tree suckers. Remove leaves, boards, boxes, trash, and other debris from planting areas. Move flower pots and other garden objects and structures that can harbor earwigs. Check plastic or organic mulches and remove them to limit earwig numbers. Trap earwigs until they’re gone. Trap earwigs with rolled newspaper, bamboo tubes, or short pieces of hose. Place these traps on the soil near plants just before dark, and shake accumulated earwigs into a pail of soapy water in the morning. Fill a low-sided can with vegetable oil and a drop of bacon grease or fish oil to attract and trap earwigs. Daily trapping will reduce earwig populations to tolerable levels. What other ways can I control earwigs outside? Drip irrigate where possible to reduce surface moisture. Keep earwigs out of stone fruit trees with a band of sticky substance such as Tanglefoot around the trunk, and harvest fruit as soon as it ripens. Insecticides should rarely be needed. How can I control earwigs inside my home? Earwigs might seek refuge indoors when conditions outside are too dry, too hot, or too cold. Large numbers of earwigs can be annoying, but present no health hazard. If earwigs invade your home, follow these steps: Sweep up or vacuum invading earwigs. Seal cracks or other entry points. Remove debris from gutters and around entryways. Keep water and moisture away from structures. Replace white outdoor lights with yellow ones, which are less attractive to earwigs. Indoor applications of pesticides aren’t recommended. ",

    "damagePestNote": "",
    "managementPestNote": "Because of the difficulty in detecting drywood termites and determining the extent of the damage, do-it-yourself treatments are not recommended. In addition, the products needed for controlling these pests are not available for homeowner use. Except for wood removal, homeowners should seek help for infestations of drywood termites from pest control professionals. This publication is intended to provide homeowners with sufficient background information so they can better discuss treatment options with pest control professionals; it is not intended as a treatment guide. Existing Infestations All drywood termite control methods can be categorized as either whole structure or localized. A whole-structure treatment is defined as the simultaneous treatment of all infestations, accessible and inaccessible, in a structure. Localized or spot treatment is more restrictive and is often applied to a single board or small group of boards. Homeowners are advised to understand the distinction between whole-structure and localized treatments when deciding which method to select, because all treatment methods are not equal. Whole-structure treatments have an advantage over localized treatments in that they should eliminate all infestations, even hidden ones. With the uncertainty of current detection methods, particularly when drywall or other wall coverings conceal infestations, there is always some doubt as to the extent of drywood termite colony boundaries and the number of colonies within homes. Consequently, one can never be sure all infestations have been treated when applying localized treatments. The strengths and limitations of whole-structure vs. localized treatments are outlined in Table 1. Whole-structure Treatment. Sulfuryl fluoride treats all infestations simultaneously and has high levels of efficacy, if correctly applied. Sulfuryl fluoride kills drywood termites within several days. A monitored fumigation, which involves installing gas monitoring lines inside the structure undergoing treatment, has the highest rate of treatment success. Nonmonitored fumigation may not have enough gas concentration to kill infestations, and failures may occur. The advantage of fumigation over localized treatment is that it should eliminate infestations hidden from view. It will also be necessary for the occupants, pets, and plants to vacate the structure for several days (depending on volume of structure and amount of gas injected) while it is being fumigated and then aerated. Additionally, roofs could be damaged as a result of having tarpaulins dragged across them. Heat is a nonchemical option for whole-structure treatment. The treatment process involves heating all wood in the structure to a minimum of 120°F and holding this temperature for at least 33 minutes. The benefit of heat treatment is the ability to treat the entire structure without using chemicals and the relatively short period of time the structure must be vacated—hours instead of days, as with fumigation. An additional advantage is that portions of large structures can be treated separately, which is very useful in apartments and condominiums. The major drawbacks of heat treatments include the difficulty in raising the internal core temperature of large infested structural beams (could take many hours or days depending on wood volume treated) and the potential for heat sinks, areas within the structure that are difficult to heat such as wood on concrete or tile. New heat emitters have been developed, but the ability of these heating devices to rid all infestations from large structures with many layers of wall coverings still remains unclear. Other issues to consider include damage to heat-sensitive items in homes, including plastics (e.g. electrical outlet covers) and cable wiring. Also, like fumigants, heat treatments have no residual effect. For long-term protection, preventive chemicals (Table 3) can be applied to areas treated with fumigants or heat.\tTable 1.

Localized Treatments There are many localized treatment methods available that include both chemical and nonchemical options (Table 2). For liquid and dust insecticides to be effective, termites must make contact with them or ingest them. Localized treatments should be applied only by licensed applicators. Home-use products are not effective. Depending on the material used for localized treatments, laboratory and field studies have shown considerable variation in their effectiveness in controlling drywood termites (see Lewis and Rust 2009, Lewis, et al. 2009, Rust and Venturina 2009, Lewis and Forschler 2014 in References). Research indicates that if you correctly locate the colony and get the chemical or nonchemical treatment directly onto the termites, the effectiveness of control will be high. For failed treatments, an additional callback treatment may lead to better results; and the use of termite detection equipment enhances the performance of any localized treatments applied. Botanical-based products (e.g., orange oil and neem oil) have been tried, but recent lab and field tests from two universities question the efficacy of at least d-limonene (Lewis and Rust 2009, Lewis, et al. 2009 in References). There are four nonchemical options for drywood termite control with localized or spot application (Table 2), including heat, which is used for both spot and whole-structure treatments. The advantages and disadvantages discussed for heat as a whole-structure treatment also apply to spot treatments. Microwave devices are also available for control. Microwaves kill termites by causing fluids inside their cells to boil, which destroys cell membranes; in short, the termites are cooked inside the wood. There are few firms now offering microwave treatments. One advantage of microwaves is their relative portability; another is that they leave no chemical residue. When using microwaves, however, detection accuracy is critical to success. Microwaves may damage the surface or interior of wooden boards, depending on the power of the device; the wattage or power of microwaves may vary from several hundred to more than 10,000 watts. Lab studies revealed no relationship between increasing microwave wattage and drywood termite mortality. As with heat treatments, it may be difficult to use microwaves to heat areas with potential heat sinks to high enough temperatures for effective control. High voltage electricity, or electrocution, is another nonchemical option. The device used emits high voltage (90,000 volts) but a low current (less than 0.5 amps). Death to drywood termites occurs by electric shock, although delayed mortality may also occur from the destruction of intestinal protozoa. The advantage of electrocution is that the equipment is portable. The limitations include detection accuracy and possible reduced efficacy from the interfering actions of common building materials (e.g., metal, concrete, and glass). If drill holes are used to enhance the flow of the current into wood, some damage occurs to wall coverings, walls, and structural wood members. Wood replacement is another remedial treatment option. However, similar to other localized treatments, its effectiveness is highly dependent on detection accuracy, as well as the extent and location of the infestation. Furthermore, if the infested wood is load-bearing either an architect, engineer, and/or general contractor should be consulted; and building permits may be necessary, adding expense. Lastly, the use of insect pathogens and parasites directed at drywood termite control has been limited, and most attempts have been reported as failures. Long-term Preventive Treatments Table 3 lists approaches to preventing drywood termites from attacking uninfested wood. Methods include chemical treatments, pressure-treated wood, barriers, and resistant wood species. Wood preservatives and pressure-treated wood (i.e., chemically treated wood that is green and sometimes brown in color) are commonly used for structural pest prevention in California. However, efficacy can be less than expected due to differences in wood destroying pest susceptibility, concentration and penetration of active ingredients in wood, the degree of drilled holes and carpentry cuts in lumber used for installation leading to breaches in chemical barrier, and leaching of chemical from exterior applications due to rain. Currently, dozens of chemical products are registered in federal and state databases for long-lasting prevention against drywood termite infestations. However, although simulated field trials have shown efficacy of some products against drywood termites in Florida, there are no field studies documenting their field performance on drywood termites that occur in California. This type of research would be required to formulate guidelines for use of preventive chemicals in California. Drawbacks with some chemical preventive treatments may include damage from drill holes, unsightly appearance from applying dusts, and potential hazards of some products to applicators. Did I make the right choice? When planning treatment of your building for drywood termite control, consider whether the whole structure is to be treated or just localized areas. Localized treatment methods make it more challenging to ensure complete control because of the difficulty in determining the extent of a drywood termite infestation. There also appears to be considerable variation in effectiveness of various techniques from applicator to applicator. Read your guarantee carefully; you may wish to consider an annual inspection service. Also important is a company’s reputation. There are thousands of pest control companies in the state, but they don’t all have the same services or quality of performance. Obtain at least three structural inspection reports before you decide. Check the reliability of the vendor by asking for client referrals, and check the status of its business license and consumer complaints with the California Structural Pest Control Board in Sacramento or your local Better Business Bureau. For added information regarding the safety of chemicals to humans and structures, request the Safety Data Sheets, or equivalent information, for nonchemical control methods, from the pest control company.",

    "damagePestNote": "Like other scales, cottony cushion scale decreases the vitality of its host by sucking phloem sap from the leaves, twigs, branches, and trunk. Feeding can result in defoliation and dieback of twigs and small branches when infestations are extremely heavy (Figure 7). Heavy populations can severely reduce the yield of citrus trees. Like soft scales, cottony cushion scale excretes honeydew, which is usually accompanied by blackish sooty mold growth and ants (Figure 8).",
    "managementPestNote": "Unless disrupted by insecticides, dust, or ants, natural enemies provide excellent control of cottony cushion scale. An exception is on Cocculus laurifolius (laurel-leaf snailseed or laurel leaf cocculus) ; it is often highly infested with cottony cushion scale, especially when grown away from the coast, because scale-feeding vedalia beetles avoid this plant. Biological Control Cottony cushion scale is usually well controlled by two introduced natural enemies. The most famous one is the vedalia beetle, Rodolia cardinalis,(Figure 9). This red and black lady beetle was introduced from Australia in the 1890s and saved California’s fledgling citrus industry from destruction by these prolific scales. Adult female beetles lay their oblong red eggs underneath the female scale or attached to her egg sac. The newly hatched reddish beetle larvae chew their way into the egg sac and feed on scale eggs and crawlers. Larvae molt two times and gradually increase in size. Mature larvae (Figure 10) and adult beetles feed on all scale stages. The fourth, and last, larval instar stops feeding, crawls toward the outside of the tree, and attaches its posterior end to a leaf in preparation for pupation. Reddish beetle pupae develop within the grayish skin of the last larval instar (Figure 11). The entire life cycle of the vedalia beetle is five to six weeks in warm weather. For photographs of each life stage of vedalia, consult Stages of the Cottony Cushion Scale (Icerya purchasi) and its Natural Enemy, the Vedalia Beetle (Rodolia cardinalis). The other important natural enemy, the parasitic fly Cryptochaetum iceryae (Figure 12), deposits one to four eggs inside each second-instar, third-instar, or adult female scale body. The eggs hatch into larvae that feed within the scale. After four molts, the larvae pupate inside the scale. When the adult fly emerges, it creates a round emergence hole, easily seen in the scale. The life cycle of the Cryptochaetum fly is about four weeks in warm weather. Both the vedalia beetle and Cryptochaetum are active in coastal areas; the vedalia beetle is also abundant in Southern California desert regions and is the predominant species in interior areas of California. Both of these natural enemies can be extremely effective in controlling cottony cushion scale because of their short generation time (four to six weeks) and host specificity, attacking only cottony cushion scale. Conserve natural enemies of cottony cushion scale by controlling ants and dust and by avoiding the use of persistent insecticides. If you find cottony cushion scale, look for the vedalia beetle and its red eggs and larvae on top of scale egg sacs or look for the beetle’s pupal cases. Inspect female scales for Cryptochaetum emergence holes. If you find evidence of these natural enemies, then insecticide treatments aren’t necessary. Controlling Ants Ants protect scale insects from predators and parasites in order to farm the honeydew the scales produce. To improve biological control, keep ants out of trees and shrubs by banding the trunks with sticky substances such as Tanglefoot or by using ant baits. Protect young or sensitive trunks, especially citrus, from possible injury by wrapping the trunk with a collar of duct tape or fabric tree wrap and coating this with the sticky material. Check the sticky material every week or two and stir it with a stick to prevent the material from becoming covered with debris that ants can cross. Alternatively, pesticide baits such as ant stakes may be placed near nests or on ant trails beneath plants. For the most effective and economical control, treat in early spring when ant populations are active but before they become heavy. For more information, see Pest Notes: Ants . Chemical Control Although adult females with their white, ridged egg sacs are the most obvious stage, insecticides don’t control adults well. The females and their eggs are protected by both the cottony egg sac and their position inside the canopy of the tree, making this pest difficult to treat. If scales can’t be tolerated, apply narrow range horticultural oil to deciduous hosts during the dormant season or spray foliage with insecticides when the females are dead and the tiny reddish scale crawlers and younger instars are infesting the leaves (spring or fall). You can use traps made of double-sided sticky tape to determine when crawlers are hatching. Before crawlers begin to emerge in spring, tightly encircle several twigs or branches near adult female scale with transparent tape that is sticky on both sides, such as Scotch double-sided tape. Change the tape at regular intervals, about once a week, and examine it with a hand lens to identify the crawlers. Once eggs begin hatching, scale crawlers get stuck on the tape and appear as red or orange specks. Spray after you observe a sharp increase in crawler production. Natural enemies are the best method for controlling cottony cushion scale, so look carefully for their presence and avoid insecticides if you find evidence of natural enemies attacking cottony cushion scale. If natural enemies are absent, the infestation is intolerable, and the population is in the treatable crawler stage, the organophosphates malathion or acephate can be effective. Both of these materials can be quite toxic to natural enemies, honey bees, and nontarget organisms; acephate is allowed only for use on ornamentals. Horticultural oil can also be applied to manage the crawler stage and is least disruptive of natural enemies or bees. Do not apply imidacloprid (Merit or Bayer Advanced Citrus Fruit and Vegetables) for cottony cushion scale control. Although imidacloprid has scale insects listed on the label, it doesn’t kill cottony cushion scale. To make matters worse, imidacloprid is very toxic to vedalia beetles. The beetles are poisoned when they feed on cottony cushion scale that have ingested imidacloprid. Cottony cushion scale outbreaks have been observed following use of this insecticide because the vedalia beetles were removed and the insecticide didn’t control the pest.\nFigure 7.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Conenose bugs are members of the family Reduviidae, commonly called assassin bugs, because most members of this family are predators of other insects. Conenose bugs or kissing bugs (genus Triatoma) are an exception to the family rule and are bloodsucking parasites that feed on a wide variety of domestic and wild animals, plus humans. In California these bugs are most prevalent in the foothill areas surrounding the Central Valley and in the foothills and desert areas of Southern California. The most important species in California is T. protracta, the western bloodsucking conenose, with T. rubida also present and important.Both species live in the nests of wood rats or pack rats (Neotoma species) and other wildlife, but they also fly into homes and may feed on people. Although the biting process is painless, people often experience an intense itch or tenderness at the bite site, which can become swollen and reddish to purple. Worse, in sensitive individuals bites from conenose bugs can produce allergic reactions that are potentially dangerous and life-threatening. In Latin America, these insects are important because they transmit the protozoan Trypanosoma cruzi, which causes Chagas disease in humans. This debilitating and often lethal disease, for which treatment is difficult, is rare in the United States, despite the fact that a significant number of bugs carry T. cruzi in their gut. Researchers attribute the low incidence of Chagas disease in humans in the US to poor efficacy of disease transmission by the bugs, infrequent human contact, and inability of the bugs to permanently colonize homes. High rates of insect infection, however, would suggest the possibility that the disease might become a problem in the United States as the global climate changes. Chagas disease is already a serious problem among dogs in some areas of south Texas. Another common assassin bug that is attracted to lights around homes, the western corsair Rasahus thoracicus, looks somewhat similar in shape to conenose bugs but has an orange and black body with an orange spot on each wing (Figure 3). The western corsair feeds primarily on other insects and doesn’t seek warm-blooded animals or require a blood meal in order to reproduce. In contrast to kissing bugs, if you pick up a corsair, it can inflict a most painful bite.",

Another common assassin bug that is attracted to lights around homes, the western corsair Rasahus thoracicus, looks somewhat similar in shape to conenose bugs but has an orange and black body with an orange spot on each wing (Figure 3). The western corsair feeds primarily on other insects and doesn’t seek warm-blooded animals or require a blood meal in order to reproduce. In contrast to kissing bugs, if you pick up a corsair, it can inflict a most painful bite.",
    "damagePestNote": "Conenose bug bites usually occur at night, and are grouped as several bites on the face, neck, arms, legs, and sometimes on the chest or other body parts. Bites are initially painless but might soon itch, swell, and cause a substantial welt that can last for several days. More severe reactions range from huge, painful welts to allergic reactions, including difficulty in breathing, low blood pressure, and rapid heart rates due to anaphylaxis. Bites from conenose bugs may be confused with spider or other arthropod bites. Conenose bug bites usually occur in the late spring to early summer and not at other times. If you suspect that you or a family member might be allergic to conenose bug bites, see a physician or allergist for treatment options. Research shows that about 7% of people tested in areas where conenose bugs are common have the potential for developing serious immediate-sensitivity reactions, including anaphylactic shock, to the bite of this insect. If treated in time, anaphylactic shock can be reversed by the effects of epinephrine (adrenaline) injected into the body. Individuals who are aware that they are allergic to bites can obtain epinephrine in an auto-injector form (Epi-Pen) by prescription. Antihistamines may have value in easing itching and swelling reactions that are not life-threatening but should be used according to a physician’s instructions. Trypansoma cruzi, the Chagas disease-causing protozoan some conenose bugs carry, is transmitted via their feces. Unlike most fly- and tick-transmitted diseases, the bug bite itself doesn’t transmit the organism or disease. Rather it is transmitted when conenose bug feces are scratched into a wound, ingested, or rubbed into moist tissues around the eyes, nose, and mouth. To prevent infection, wash the wound areas with soap and water; launder soiled clothing or bedding; and never scratch (especially to bleeding) the itchy wound, put fingers into your mouth or nose, or rub your eyes. Immediate or acute symptoms of this disease include swelling of the face, especially of one eye (Romaña’s sign), high or moderate fever that develops about two weeks after the victim is bitten, swelling of other body areas, and disturbance of the heart rhythm. If the patient isn’t treated in the early stages of the disease, prolonged chronic infection becomes established and may result in cardiac damage, other serious disorders, or death.",
    "managementPestNote": "Various measures can be taken to prevent problems with conenose bugs. These include removing likely harborages such as rodent nests (especially wood rat nests), sealing entry points, fixing structural problems in buildings that permit the bug’s entry, and modifying lighting. Use weather stripping, caulk, or silicone seal to eliminate small cracks and crevices. Screen all windows and vent openings, making sure dog and cat entrances are insect-proof. Since white lights attract the insects at night, move inside lights away from doors and windows and, especially during late spring and summer, change outdoor and porch lights to yellow bulbs, reduce the wattage, or both. Remove rodent nests that are located within 300 feet of the house. Eliminate harborages including piles of lumber, firewood, and debris. Check beds at night, and shake out the bedding before getting into bed. Keep beds at least 1 foot from walls, don’t allow bedding to touch the floor, and place double-sided sticky tape on the legs. In extreme cases, a tent of mosquito netting over the bed that is tucked in all around the mattress will provide maximum protection. If the above measures don’t manage the problem, contact your local vector control agency or pest control company.",

    "name": "Codling Moth",
    "urlPestNote": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/PESTNOTES/pn7412.html?src=exchbt",
    "descriptionPestNote": "Codling moth, Cydia (Laspeyresia) pomonella, is a serious insect pest of apples, pears, and English walnuts. Codling moth adults are about 1/2 to 3/4 inch long with mottled gray wings that they hold tentlike over their bodies (Figure 1). Their appearance blends well with most tree bark, making them difficult to detect. If you are trapping the adults, you can distinguish codling moth from other moths by the dark, coppery brown band at the tip of their wings. The larvae are white to light pink “worms” with a dark brown head (Figure 2). They are one of the few caterpillars likely to be found inside pear or apple fruit. Navel orangeworms also might be found in walnuts, but these can be distinguished from codling moth larvae by the crescent-shaped markings on the second segment behind the orangeworm head and by the excess webbing they leave in the nut.",
    "life_cycle": "Codling moth overwinters as full-grown larvae within thick, silken cocoons under loose scales of bark and in soil or debris around the base of the tree. The larvae pupate inside their cocoons in early spring and emerge as adult moths mid-March to early April. The moths are active only a few hours before and after sunset, and they mate when sunset temperatures exceed 62°F. After mating each female deposits 30 to 70 tiny, disc-shaped eggs singly on fruit, nuts, leaves, or spurs. After the eggs hatch, young larvae seek out and bore into fruit or developing nuts. After completing development they leave the fruit and drop from the trees to search out pupation sites and continue the life cycle in the soil or on debris under the tree; some crawl back up the tree to pupate in bark crevices (Figure 5). The rate of development will vary with temperature, proceeding more rapidly in warmer weather and climates. Depending on the climate, codling moth can have two, three, and sometimes four generations per year.",
    "damagePestNote": "On apples and pears, larvae penetrate into the fruit and tunnel to the core, leaving holes in the fruit that are filled with reddish-brown, crumbly droppings called frass (Figure 6). If left uncontrolled, larvae can cause substantial damage, often infesting 20 to 90% of the fruit, depending on the variety and location. Late maturing varieties are more likely to suffer severe damage than early varieties. In walnuts, larvae feed on the kernels (Figure 7). Nuts damaged early in the season when the nuts are quite small will drop off trees soon after damage occurs. Nuts damaged later in the season will remain on trees, but their kernels are inedible. Walnuts aren’t as favored a host as apples and pears, and untreated trees might incur very little to modest damage (10 to 15% of the nuts), depending on the variety and location.",
    "managementPestNote": "Codling moth can be very difficult to manage, especially if the population has been allowed to build up over a season or two. It is much easier to keep moth numbers low from the start than to suppress a well-established population. In trees with low levels, codling moth often can be kept to tolerable levels by using a combination of nonchemical management methods; however, it is important to begin implementing these measures early in the season. Where populations are moderate to high and many infested trees are nearby, insecticide applications might be necessary to bring populations down to low levels. To be effective, the timing of insecticide spray applications is critical, and several applications are necessary, especially with newer, less toxic pesticides. In most backyard situations, the best course of action might be to combine a variety of the nonchemical and/or low toxicity chemical methods discussed below and accept the presence of some wormy fruit. If eating wormy fruit, be sure to cut out damaged portions, because they might contain toxins (aflatoxin) generated by mold. It is ideal to make codling moth management a neighborhood project, because your trees can be infested by moths from your neighbor’s trees, despite your own best efforts at keeping populations of this pest down. Nonchemical Control Several methods are available for reducing codling moth that don’t require using insecticides. Selecting varieties that are less susceptible to damage, such as early-maturing apples and pears and late-leafing walnuts, can greatly reduce the potential for damage. This can be especially important in the hot Central Valley climates that have additional generations and result in higher population pressure. Once trees are planted, nonchemical control methods include sanitation and fruit bagging. These methods are described below. Thinning out and removing infested fruit on the tree is an especially important part of an IPM program for codling moth. Pruning trees to a height where the canopy is easy to reach also will facilitate management of this pest. If a backyard tree or orchard has a very high moth population, it might be impossible to satisfactorily reduce codling moth without using pesticides. Also, nearby orchards or backyard trees in which no control program is in place can serve as a continual source of codling moth and can make it even more difficult to limit damage through nonchemical means alone. Sanitation. Sanitation should be the first step in any codling moth control program, and it is even more important for those wishing to use primarily nonchemical management approaches. Every week or two, beginning about six to eight weeks after bloom, check fruit on trees for signs of damage. Remove and destroy any infested fruit showing the frass-filled holes. Removing infested fruit before the larvae are old enough to crawl out and begin the next generation can be a very effective method for reducing the population. Thinning out the infested fruit has the added benefit of encouraging the remaining fruit on the tree to grow larger. It also might improve spray coverage, if sprays are used. It also is important to clean up dropped fruit as soon as possible after they fall, because dropped fruit can have larvae in them. Removing infested fruit from the tree and promptly picking up dropped fruit from the ground is most critical in May and June but should continue throughout the season. Bagging fruit. Excellent control can be achieved by enclosing young fruit in bags right on the tree to protect them from the codling moth. This is the only nonchemical control method that is effective enough to be used alone and in higher population situations. However, it is quite time consuming to apply the bags, so this method is most manageable on smaller trees with fewer fruit. You can bag all the fruit on the tree or just as many fruit as you think you will need. Keep in mind that unbagged fruit are likely to serve as a host and increase the pest population, so it would be prudent to employ sanitation to keep the population in check. Bagging should be done about four to six weeks after bloom when the fruit is from 1/2 to 1 inch in diameter. Prepare No. 2 paper bags (the standard lunch bag size that measures 7 1/4 inches by 4 inches) by cutting a 2-inch slit in the bottom fold of each bag. Thin the fruit to one per cluster. Slip the thinned fruit through the 2-inch slit so that it forms a seal around the stem and staple the open end shut. It is difficult or impossible to bag certain varieties with very short stems such as Gravenstein. Also late-developing varieties might be attacked by codling moth even before they are 1/2 inch in diameter, so they might not be protected. Some gardeners have found success with cotton tie string bags; nylon bags, however, aren’t effective. This technique won’t affect the maturity or quality of the fruit, but it will prevent full color development on red varieties. You’ll need to open some bags to check for ripeness as harvest time approaches. Some people open the bags up a week or two before harvest to allow color development, but the fruit still might be attacked if codling moth eggs are being laid. Other benefits to bagging include protection from sunburn and larger fruit as a result of diligent thinning. Trapping. Hanging traps in each susceptible fruit or nut tree might help to reduce codling moth populations on isolated trees but isn’t a reliable way to reduce damage. If it works at all, this method likely will have the most effect where trees are isolated from other trees harboring codling moth (e.g., apple, pear, or English walnut) and when several traps are placed in a tree. Use in combination with sanitation and other control methods for the best effect and expect damaged fruit. Codling moth pheromone traps are important for monitoring flight activity of moths to help time insecticide treatments. Traps are available from many commercial sources, such as hardware stores, garden centers, or online. These traps usually have a sticky cardboard bottom and are baited with a pheromone (sex attractant) lure. The lure mimics the scent of a female moth, attracting males to the trap. Traps should be put up in mid-March in the Central Valley and by the end of March in coastal areas. They should be hung as high as possible in the tree canopy. Check them every few days for moths. Only one trap is required if you are using them to monitor moth flights to time insecticide treatments. See the Insecticides section for more information. Trunk banding. A traditional, nonchemical method for controlling codling moth is to trap mature larvae in a cardboard band as they climb the trunk seeking a place to pupate. Banding works best on smooth-barked varieties such as Red Delicious apple, which don’t provide good alternative pupation sites. Scaly-barked varieties such as Newtown Pippin and most types of pears have so many crevices on the trunk that many larva will pupate before they get to the banded area. However, even in the best situations, banding will control only a very small percentage of the codling moth, because many pupate elsewhere on the tree or in the ground. Additionally, if bands aren’t removed and destroyed in a timely fashion, they could increase the population, so banding no longer is recommended for control in home gardens. Biological control. Although a few predators such as spiders or carabid beetles might feed on codling moth larvae or pupae, naturally occurring biological control isn’t effective. In commercial walnut and pear orchards, releases of the tiny wasp Trichogramma platneri have been used successfully to manage codling moth in combination with mating disruption or soft pesticides. This method hasn’t been successful in commercial apples and hasn’t been tested in backyards. Insecticides Tools: Degree-day calculator, Sunset temperatures, Degree-day table Proper timing of insecticide sprays is critical if they are to be effective against codling moth; they should be applied before or just as eggs are hatching. Once the worm has gone into the fruit or nut, it is protected from pesticides. Timing with degree-day calculations. The most effective way to time insecticide sprays is with a pheromone trap and a degree-day calculation. This is what commercial growers use. The trap lets them know when each generation or flight begins. The degree-day calculation lets them know just when egg hatch will occur and when the next generation should begin to fly. You can calculate degree-days with a maximum-minimum thermometer and a degree-day chart, or you can use the automated weather stations and degree-day calculator on the UC IPM Web site. Timing by monitoring stings. Although timing sprays is best done with the use of degree-day calculations, home gardeners can also monitor fruit in their trees to detect the beginning of egg hatch. Starting three to four weeks after bloom, check fruit at least twice a week looking for the first “stings,” or tiny mounds of reddish-brown frass about 1/16 inch in diameter. If you scrape the frass away you will see the tiny entry hole where the newly hatched larvae has just entered the fruit. Be sure to examine the fruit where it touches another fruit, as this is a common place to find an entry hole. Spray the tree as soon as you see the first sting; however, first remove any fruit with stings from the tree, as the insecticide won’t kill any larva that already have entered the fruit. Expect to have more damage with this monitoring method than the degree-day method, since it can be difficult to find the very first sting. Home orchards might be able to achieve an acceptable level of control by spraying the first spring generation and using nonchemical methods to maintain a low population for the rest of the season. However, if heavy infestations have occurred in previous years, if there are unmanaged host trees nearby, or if tolerance for damage is very low, the summer generation(s) also need to be treated. In cooler coastal areas look for the first stings from the spring generation in early to mid-May, about a month after bloom. Look for new stings from the single summer generation beginning in mid-July to mid-August, about 10 to 13 weeks after the spring hatch begins. Coastal areas usually have just two generations per year. In the warmer Central Valley area look for the spring generation stings in mid- to late April, about a month after bloom. Look for new stings from the first summer generation beginning in early to late June, about eight weeks after the spring hatch began. In the Sacramento and Northern San Joaquin valleys, a second and last summer generation will begin in early to mid-August. In the very hot southern San Joaquin Valley, look for the second summer generation stings to begin in mid-July and the third summer generation to begin in mid-August. Codling moth granulosis virus. Recently a new biological insecticide, CYD-X, a granulosis virus that affects only larvae (caterpillars) of the codling moth, has become available to home gardeners in California. Codling moth larvae must ingest this virus for it to be effective. Once ingested, the virus infects the digestive tract of the caterpillar causing a disease that kills it within three to seven days. It doesn’t affect other insects, humans, pets, or wildlife and is OMRI listed as suitable for use in certified organic production. University of California trials have shown that this product, when applied weekly during egg hatch throughout the season, is as effective as carbaryl sprays at controlling codling moth in backyard trees. More applications are needed—carbaryl must be applied only every 14 to 21 days or one to two times per generation—but many environmentally conscious gardeners are willing to make this trade off. CYD-X also has the advantage of having no preharvest interval, so applications can be made up until the time of harvest and there are no limits on the number of times you can spray it. Like other insecticides, granulosis virus should be applied as soon as the eggs of the first generation codling moth hatch. If you are using pheromone traps and degree day calculations as described above, this would be 200 to 250 degree-days after you begin regularly catching male moths. If you are just checking fruit, this would be when you see the first stings. Make applications weekly after that. You’ll need a good sprayer, and you must get good coverage of fruit. Adding 1% oil to the application can improve effectiveness. CYD-X is a new product that might be difficult to find in stores but can be ordered on the Internet. Spinosad. Spinosad is a biological product made from a naturally occurring bacterium called Saccharopolyspora spinosa. It is a lower-toxicity material that is safe for most beneficial insects as well as for people, pets, and the environment although it is more toxic to beneficials than granulosis virus. Repeated applications each generation are necessary for acceptable control. The first spring generation requires three sprays applied at 10-day intervals beginning at egg hatch (i.e., 250 degree-days, or when the first stings are found). For any subsequent summer generations, two sprays should suffice with the first spray applied at the beginning of each new egg hatch and the second spray applied 10 to 14 days later. No more than six sprays should be applied per season, and they shouldn’t be applied within seven days of harvest. The addition of a 1% horticultural oil to the spray tank will further enhance the effectiveness of this material. Spinosad is available through retail outlets under various trade names including Monterey Garden Insect Spray or Green Light Spinosad Lawn & Garden Spray. Carbaryl. One of the more effective materials against codling moth is the broad-spectrum insecticide carbaryl (Sevin). However, this material has significant drawbacks. It remains effective for 14 to 21 days, but it is very disruptive to natural enemies and honey bees. Applying more than one carbaryl spray per season might lead to an outbreak of pest mites. Also carbaryl has been associated with water quality problems. If your tree is heavily infested and more than one spray is needed, it might be prudent to alternate this material with granulosis virus or spinosad. Carbaryl never should be sprayed during bloom or when bees are present. It also shouldn’t be used on apples within one month of bloom, as it can cause the fruit to drop; use one of the other materials if a spray needs to be applied at this time. The homeowner shouldn’t apply carbaryl within three days of fruit harvest or 14 days before walnut harvest. Carbaryl should be applied at 250 degree-days or as soon as you see the first sting in spring. A second application might be needed at 650 degree-days, or 21 to 28 days later, to cover the prolonged spring emergence. If later summer generations require treatment, a single carbaryl application should suffice for each subsequent generation, as the insect develops more quickly during the warm weather of summer. Refer to the online degree-day guidelines for timing these later sprays or visually monitor for each new generation using the timing guidelines above. Other materials. Bacillus thuringiensis, pyrethrum, and pyrethrin/rotenone combinations are low toxicity materials that have been tested and haven’t been found to be effective at controlling codling moth.  Horticultural oil has shown variable efficacy when used alone but can be mixed with granulosis virus or spinosad to improve performance. Mating disruption products that employ large quantities of pheromone to prevent mating or pheromone plus an insecticide to attract and kill male moths have proven effective for large commercial plantings but aren’t effective on small orchards of fewer than 5 acres. In fact, mating disruption can increase damage if used on small plantings or individual trees.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Codling moth, the infamous “worm” in the apple, is difficult to manage in the home orchard. Soon after hatching, caterpillars bore into apples, pears, or walnuts and feed, leaving reddish-brown droppings (frass). Early-maturing fruit varieties are less likely to suffer damage. Use an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that combines several of the methods described below. Trees heavily infested every year require carefully timed sprays. Codling moth life cycle: Mature larvae overwinter under bark in cocoons and pupate in spring. Adult moths emerge in mid-March to April and mate after sunset temperatures exceed 62°F. Tiny disc-shaped eggs are laid on fruit or leaves. Hatching larvae immediately bore into fruit. Larvae feed within fruit until mature then drop to the ground to pupate in soil or debris or under tree bark. Two to four generations occur per year in California. Reduce codling moths with sanitation practices. Promptly remove infested fruit from trees. Look for worm entry points (“stings”) marked by tiny mounds of reddish-brown frass. Rake up and destroy dropped fruit as soon as it falls, especially in May and June. Sanitation alone won’t control the pest. Bagging protects fruit without chemical sprays, even when infestations are severe. Bag when fruit is 1⁄2 to 1 inch in diameter, four to six weeks after bloom. Cut a 2-inch slit in the bottom of a standard lunch bag, thin fruit to one per cluster, slip the fruit through the slit, and staple the bag shut. Remove bags just as fruit begins ripening. Use insecticides when infestations are severe. Codling moth granulosis virus (sold as Cyd-X) is a safe biological pesticide that won’t harm beneficials or bees. Add 1% horticultural oil to increase effectiveness. Apply every seven days after eggs hatch, at least three or four times per generation. Spinosad is a low-toxicity pesticide made more effective by adding 1% horticultural oil. Apply every 10 days after eggs hatch, or about three times per generation. Carbaryl is effective when properly timed at 14- to 21-day intervals but is very toxic to natural enemies, honey bees, and other nontargets and can cause water quality problems. Combining low-toxicity insecticides with nonchemical methods is the most environmentally sound approach. Insecticides are effective only when sprays are precisely timed to kill caterpillars just as they hatch. Hang a pheromone trap in your tree in March, and check it every few days for moths. Once moths are found and sunset temperatures exceed 62°F, start calculating degree-days following the instructions in Pest Notes: Codling Moth. Degree-days will help you determine when eggs will hatch or when to start looking for “stings” on fruit that indicate larvae have hatched and are entering fruit. Start applying insecticides as soon as degree-day calculations indicate eggs are hatching (250-300 degree-days after moths are caught in traps) or as soon as you see stings. Use new stings or degree-day calculations to initiate sprays for second and third generations. ",

    "managementPestNote": "Managing cockroaches is not easy. For serious indoor infestations and other large or complex cockroach problems, professional pest control services are often required. In some cases, however, you can manage cockroaches on your own. To be successful, you must first determine which species is present and where they are located. The more hiding places you locate and manage, the more successful your control program will be. Remember that most cockroaches are tropical and like warm, dark hiding places with access to water. Some of these locations may be difficult to access. To prevent cockroach infestations, it is essential to reduce food and water sources as well as known and potential hiding places. If cockroaches have access to food, baits (which are primary control tools) may take longer to provide satisfactory control. Insecticide sprays alone will not eliminate cockroaches. An integrated pest management (IPM) approach that uses several control methods is usually required. Monitoring for Cockroaches Traps. Sticky traps or glue boards offer the best way to detect and monitor cockroach populations. By placing traps in several locations and inspecting them regularly, you can identify the most severely infested areas and know where to concentrate control efforts. Traps can also be very helpful in evaluating the effectiveness of control programs. Most cockroach sticky traps available at home and garden stores work well for monitoring. These traps are open at both ends and are lined inside with a sticky material. To be effective, traps must be placed where cockroaches are likely to encounter them when foraging. The best places are at the junctions of floors and walls and close to sites where cockroaches are suspected. Good potential monitoring sites can be determined by accumulations of fecal matter (e.g., dark spots or smears), cast skins, egg cases, and live or dead cockroaches. Place traps in all corners of the room to give you an idea where cockroaches are entering. In the kitchen, put traps against walls behind large appliances and in cabinets. Number the traps so you can keep records for each trap separately. Check the traps daily for several days until it is apparent where the greatest number of cockroaches are being caught. Many times, cockroaches will be caught within the first 24 hours of placing a trap. Discard sticky traps by placing them in a sealed plastic bag in the trash. To evaluate success, keep records of cockroaches trapped in different locations before and after you start your management efforts. You can also detect a cockroach infestation by using a flashlight to inspect cracks, underneath counters, around water heaters, and in other dark locations. A small mirror on a long handle can be useful in hard-to-see areas. Other Methods Sanitation. Cockroaches thrive where food and water are available to them. Even tiny amounts of crumbs or liquids caught between cracks provide a food source. Important sanitation measures include the following:\tStore food in insect-proof containers such as glass jars or re-sealable plastic containers.\tKeep garbage and trash in containers with tight-fitting lids and use plastic liners when possible. Keep trash cans away from doorways. Special trash cans may be mounted on pedestals in public spaces like schools to keep them off the ground where cockroaches forage. Remove trash, newspapers, magazines, piles of paper bags, rags, boxes, and other items that provide hiding places and harborage.\tEliminate plumbing leaks and other sources of moisture. Increase ventilation where condensation is a problem.\tVacuum cracks and crevices to remove food and debris. Be sure surfaces where food or beverages have been spilled are cleaned up immediately. Vacuuming also removes cockroaches, shed skins, and egg cases, reducing overall cockroach numbers.\tBecause aerosolized bits of shed skins and droppings of cockroaches may cause allergies when inhaled, it is recommended that the vacuum cleaner have a high efficiency particulate absorber (HEPA) filter or triple filters.\tExclusion and Removal of Hiding Places. During the day, cockroaches hide around water heaters, in cupboard cracks, stoves, crawl spaces, outdoor vegetation, and many other dark locations. They invade kitchens and other areas at night. Limiting hiding areas or avenues of access to living areas is an essential part of an effective management strategy. False-bottom cupboards, hollow walls, and similar areas are common cockroach refuges that should be properly sealed. If it is not practical to remedy these problem areas, consider insecticides formulated for cockroach control (Table 3 and Table 4). See the Chemical Control section for specific options. Limit Access. Prevent access to the inside of buildings through cracks, conduits, under doors, or through other structural flaws. Take the following measures if observation or trapping shows cockroaches are migrating into a building from outdoors or other areas of the building:\tSeal cracks and other openings to the outside.\tUse door sweeps and weather stripping on doors and windows.\tLook for other methods of entry, such as from items being brought into the building, especially appliances, furniture, boxes, and items that were recently in storage.\tInspect food deliveries before putting them in kitchens.\tLook for egg cases glued to undersides of furniture, in refrigerator and other appliance motors, boxes, and other items. Remove any that you find.\tLocate and seal cracks where cockroaches can hide.\tTrim shrubbery around buildings to increase light and air circulation, especially near vents, and eliminate ivy or other dense ground covers near the house, as these may harbor cockroaches.\tRemove trash and stored items such as stacks of lumber or firewood from around the outside of buildings that provide hiding places for cockroaches.\tConsider keeping a layer of gravel about 6 to 12 inches wide around the perimeter of buildings. This reduces moisture, making this area less hospitable to outdoor cockroaches.\tChemical Control Insecticides are most effective in controlling cockroaches when combined with sanitation and exclusion practices that limit the cockroach’s ability to establish or reinvade. Pesticides alone will not solve a cockroach problem. If insecticides are used, they must always be used with extreme care. Indoor chemical control is warranted only if the cockroach population is established, not for an incidental intruder or two. Baits. Bait products are the primary pesticides used to treat cockroach infestations. They can be packaged as pastes, gels, and granules (Table 3). Most insecticides used in baits are slow acting. Baits do not control all cockroaches equally. For instance, brownbanded cockroaches are especially difficult to control using baits. Female cockroaches with egg cases do very little feeding and avoid open spaces, so they are less likely to be immediately affected by a bait. An effective bait program does not give immediate results but instead may take 7 days or longer. Baits can be quite effective for long-term control of cockroaches. Removing other food sources will greatly enhance the effects of baits. As with sticky traps, insecticidal baits do not attract cockroaches over long distances, so place them near hiding spaces or where roaches are likely to encounter them while foraging. Outdoors, place baits and bait stations around building perimeters (in valve or water meter boxes, wood piles, and around planters. Indoors, place baits under appliances, along walls, and in cabinets. Baits can also be placed next to fecal specks and droppings of cockroaches. These deposits contain a natural attractant or aggregation pheromone. Look for these fecal specks and droppings under kitchen counters, behind kitchen drawers, and in the back of cabinets. Bait Stations. The most popular bait application method for home use is within prefilled bait stations, small plastic units that contain an attractive food base along with an insecticide. Refillable bait stations are available in stores and can be refilled with bait granules or gel. The advantage of bait stations is that insecticides are confined to small areas within tamper-resistant containers rather than being dispersed widely, potentially reducing exposure to people and pets. Baits in stations remain effective for many months. Gel Bait. For crack and crevice treatments, gel baits can be very effective. Apply gel using a bait gun or syringe in small dabs in cracks and crevices where cockroaches will find it. Gel baits are very effective when placed in or near locations where cockroaches harbor or forage. In some cases, gels may need to be reapplied since deposits harden over time. Gels are very effective when applied to manage German cockroaches and other species living inside structures. Research suggests that gel baits, applied within bait stations and in-ground utility ports, can also be used to effectively manage outdoor cockroaches. Available commercial baits (see Table 3) may contain abamectin, boric acid, fipronil, hydramethylnon, indoxacarb, clothianidin, or imidacloprid mixed with a food base. Some of these products are only available to licensed professionals. Dusts and powders. Insecticidal dusts (Table 4) can be important parts of an IPM program when applied in enclosed, out-of-the-way locations where cockroaches may hide. The most common active ingredient used against cockroaches is boric acid. Boric acid powder is a contact and oral insecticide and can be used preventively or when treating existing infestations. Boric acid is not repellent, and if it remains dry and undisturbed, it provides control for a very long time. Because it has a positive electrostatic charge, the dust clings to the body of a cockroach as it walks through a treated area, and the cockroach ingests small amounts when it grooms itself. Boric acid powder has fairly slow activity, and it may be 7 days or more before it has a significant effect on a cockroach population. Boric acid is not recommended for outdoor use since it is toxic to plants. Blow dusts and powders into cracks and crevices or lightly spread it in areas where visible residues are not a problem and where people will not come into contact with it. Remove kick panels on refrigerators and stoves and apply a light film of dust throughout the entire void underneath these appliances. Thin films of dust are more effective than thick layers, which may cake and clump together. Holes the size of the tip of a puff-type applicator can be drilled into the top of kick panels beneath cabinets, and dusts and powders may be applied through the holes to these areas as well as under the sink, in the void space between the sink and wall, and around utility pipe penetrations. Also treat along the back edges and in corners of shelves in cabinets, cupboards, pantries, and closets. Formulated as insecticides, boric acid products usually contain about 1% of an additive that prevents caking and improves application properties. If a deposit gets wet and then dries and cakes, it loses its electrostatic charge and will not be picked up readily by cockroaches. If this occurs, clean up old deposits and reapply to these areas. Desiccant dusts such as diatomaceous earth and silica aerogel are repellent and effective when applied to voids and other out-of-the-way places. Silica aerogel readily absorbs waxes from the surface of insects, resulting in their desiccation (dehydration) and death. Silica aerogels may be applied during construction or to prevent cockroaches from becoming established. Foggers, Sprays, and Aerosols. Although sprays may provide a quick, temporary knockdown of cockroaches, they do not give long-term control. They may also repel and disperse cockroaches to other areas of the building from which they may return later. Cockroaches have also become resistant to many insecticides in common sprays and aerosols that formerly controlled them. Sprays should not be necessary if an IPM program is followed that uses sanitation, exclusion, and appropriate baits and dusts. Insecticide treatment of harborage sites for oriental, Turkestan, and American cockroaches may be required when populations of these species are high and cockroaches are moving into buildings. Follow-up After a cockroach IPM program has been started, evaluate the effectiveness of the methods that are being used with regular monitoring. Use traps or visual inspections to help determine if further treatment is necessary. If populations persist, reevaluate the situation. Look for other sources of infestations, make sure that all possible entryways are blocked, be certain that food and water sources are eliminated as much as possible, and continue sealing and eliminating hiding places. It may be necessary to move bait stations to other locations, use more stations, apply more bait, or consider a different bait product. When cockroach populations are under control, continue monitoring with traps on a regular basis to make sure re-infestation is not taking place. Maintain sanitation and exclusion techniques to avoid encouraging a new infestation. If severe re-infestations continue to recur, consider having the infested areas modified or remodeled to reduce the amount of suitable habitat for cockroaches.\tTable 3.

    "contentQuickTips": "Cockroaches thrive in both indoor and outdoor environments that provide food, water, and shelter. During the day, roaches hide in dark, moist areas like cracks, water meter boxes, sewers, and crawl spaces. They come out at night to feed. Good sanitation and exclusion are important for effective control; pesticides alone will not solve cockroach problems. When using insecticides, baits provide better control than sprays. Identify the cockroach species before taking action. Effective management options vary according to species. Cockroach sticky traps are useful in catching roaches for identification. Some cockroaches live outdoors but can invade indoor spaces (American, oriental, and Turkestan) while others live and breed entirely indoors (German and brownbanded). Remove food and water sources. Store food in tightly sealed containers. Keep trash in containers with tight lids. Fix plumbing and irrigation leaks to reduce sources of water. Regularly vacuum indoor cracks and crevices, clean behind kitchen appliances, and clean floors and counters, since even tiny crumbs or liquids provide good food sources. Exclude roaches and remove their hiding places. Seal cracks and other openings in walls, under and around doors, and around windows to prevent invaders coming in from outside. Use door sweeps and weather stripping on doors and windows. Seal cracks in false bottoms of cupboards and other indoor hiding places. Remove old papers, cardboard boxes, and other clutter, especially in kitchens and bathrooms. Use traps to identify and track cockroach populations. Cockroach sticky traps are available in garden and hardware stores. Place traps on the floor around edges of walls, in cupboards, and other places where you think roaches are foraging. Place traps near exterior doors to catch invading outdoor species. Check traps daily until you can tell where the most cockroaches are being caught. What about pesticides? Avoid using foggers, bombs, or aerosol sprays; these products can be hazardous and may repel and disperse cockroaches to other areas without actually killing them. Insecticide sprays do not provide long-term control. Sprays are not necessary if cleanup and removal of hiding places is combined with effective baits and boric acid powder. Boric acid powders and desiccant dusts may be applied within hollow walls, under refrigerators, and other undisturbed hiding places. This approach is very effective but may require a pest control professional. These materials must remain dry and undisturbed in order to be effective. Insecticide gels and bait stations placed near cockroach hiding areas can be effective if other food sources are removed. It may be 7 days or longer before you see fewer cockroaches. To control outdoor cockroaches, place baits in water meter boxes, drains, or under concrete slabs. Contact a pest control professional for very serious infestations. ",

    "damagePestNote": "The webbing clothes moth is probably the most commonly encountered clothes moth in the United States. The casemaking clothes moth is less common and also of far less economic importance than the webbing clothes moth. The larva is the damaging stage of the clothes moth. Both species feed on wool clothing, carpets, and rugs; upholstered furniture; furs; stored woolen items; animal bristles in brushes; wool felt pads in pianos; and fish meal in fish food. They will feed on synthetics or cotton blends if these fabrics also contain wool. Larvae might also use cotton fibers to make their pupal cases. Damage generally appears in hidden locations such as beneath collars or cuffs of clothing, in crevices of upholstered furniture, and in carpeted areas beneath furniture. Fabrics with food, perspiration, or urine stains are more subject to damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "Methods for controlling clothes moths include periodic dry cleaning or laundering, proper storage, freezing, heating, fumigating with dry ice, trapping, or insecticides. Keeping humidity levels low inside buildings creates an environment that isn't favorable for clothes moth development. Buildings that don't have numerous tiny cracks and crevices will also have fewer clothes moth problems. Good housekeeping practices are important as well. It is also important to regularly monitor fabrics and closets for clothes moths and their damage so you can take action when infestations are still small. Although most people can manage clothes moth problems themselves, some infestations are best handled by a pest control applicator, who has the equipment, materials, and experience to deal with difficult control jobs. Monitoring To inspect for clothes moths, look to see if there are silken tubes in the hidden portions of clothes, such as under collars, or silken mats or patches on material. Both the silken tubes and mats often have fibers and feces incorporated into them. Check to see if you can find any sign of surface grazing of fibers, any holes, or both on the fabrics. With fur, look to see if you have some hairs clipped at their base, causing loose fur and exposed hide. Fully grown larvae of the casemaking clothes moth make cigar-shaped, open-ended silken cases that are about 3/8 inch long, often with pieces of infested material incorporated into the case. The case containing a live larva is often attached to the infested material at on end. Pheromone traps, discussed below in Trapping, are also very useful for detecting clothes moths. Preventing or Reducing Infestations Periodically cleaning areas in your home that can harbor clothes moths can prevent or control infestations. These areas include seldom-cleaned spots such as beneath heavy pieces of furniture; along baseboards and in cracks where hair and debris accumulate; in closets, especially those in which woolens and furs are kept; and inside and behind heaters and inside vents. The vacuum cleaner is the best tool for most of this cleaning. After using it in infested areas, dispose of the bag's contents promptly, since it can include eggs, larvae, or adult moths. Clothes moths might initially establish themselves on woolen garments or scraps stored for long periods. In addition to properly storing woolen items (See Protecting Items in Storage.), periodically hang them in the sun and brush them thoroughly, especially along seams and inside folds and pockets. Brushing destroys eggs and exposes larvae. Larvae don't like bright light and will fall from clothing when they can't find protection. If the infestation is in a closet, be sure to remove and clean all clothes and fabric that were stored inside and thoroughly vacuum and wash the inside of the closet, especially all cracks and crevices, before returning the cleaned clothes. Dust insecticides containing pyrethroids or pyrethrin (e.g., 0.05% Deltamethrin or 1% pyrethrin) can be applied in the cracks and crevices. Always follow the label requirements when applying these dusts. Dry Cleaning and Laundering The most common and effective method for killing all stages of clothes moths in clothing, blankets, and other washable articles is to thoroughly launder them for 20 to 30 minutes in water that is at least 120°F. Because many woolen items shouldn't be washed in hot water, sending your items to a dry cleaner might be the only suitable option. Keeping fabrics clean has another advantage—insects are less likely to feed on clean fabrics than on heavily soiled ones. Protecting Items in Storage Clothes moths often damage improperly stored articles. When storing susceptible items, be sure they are clean and pest free, and place them in an airtight container. You can place insect repellents such as herbal oils into the storage container, but little is known about their effectiveness. Moth balls, flakes, or crystals containing 1,4-dichlorobenzene (also called paradichlorobenzene) also are available for protecting clothes in storage. Because these materials are toxic, be sure to keep them away from children and pets. These products have other shortcomings as well. They leave an unpleasant odor on clothes and other cloth objects, and if these products come into contact with plastic buttons, hangers, or garment bags, they can cause the plastic to soften and melt into the fabric. As these chemicals evaporate, they produce vapors that, in sufficient concentration, will slowly kill insects. The vapors build up to the required concentration only in an airtight container. If the container isn't airtight, the chemicals only somewhat repel adults, and any larvae already on clothes continue to feed. The effectiveness of cedar chests and closet floors made of cedar is debatable. Aromatic eastern red cedar, Juniperus virginiana, contains an oil that can kill small larvae, but it doesn't affect large larvae. After several years, however, cedar loses this quality. Having a tightly constructed chest is more important in the long run than the type of wood used to make it. Freezing and Heating You can also control clothes moths by heating the infested item in an oven for at least 30 minutes at temperatures higher than 120°F, enclosing the item in a plastic bag and placing it in a freezer for several days at temperatures lower than 18°F, or fumigating the item with dry ice. Before using any of these methods, consider if cold or heat will damage the fabric. For more information, see the Household Furnishings section. Trapping Trapping is a relatively easy-to-use technique that helps to detect and reduce a webbing clothes moth infestation. Pheromone traps are available to trap both the webbing clothes moth and the casemaking clothes moth. Pheromones are chemicals an organism producesï¿½in this case a sex attractantï¿½to affect the behavior of other members of the same species. The sex pheromone attracts male moths into the trap where they get stuck on the sticky sides. Because the pheromone specifically attracts clothes moths, it wonï¿½t attract other moth species. Conversely, pheromone traps for other species such as grain-infesting moths wonï¿½t attract clothes moths. Pheromone traps for clothes moths are available at major hardware stores. Place traps in closets and other clothes-storage areas. Trapping not only enables you to detect the presence of clothes moths but provides some control, because trapped males can't mate. However, if you trap moths, you should also take other measures, such as dry cleaning or laundering, to protect clothes exposed to moths. Using Insecticide Sprays If you have clothes moths but the articles can't be dry cleaned, laundered, heated, frozen, kept in cold storage, or fumigated with dry ice, you can spray them with an insecticide. Find a product that lists clothes moths on its label, and follow the directions exactly. Insecticides for clothes moths usually contain pyrethrins, which provide quick knockdown of clothes moths. You can spray most of these products directly onto fabrics. Always follow the instructions in the product label. Pyrethrin insecticides don't leave persistent toxic residues, which makes them more suitable for clothes moth control in many cases than a lot of other products. Some insecticide sprays have an oil base, so don't spray them on silk, rayon, or other fabrics that stain easily. Also, don't use them around open flames, sparks, or electrical circuits, and don't spray them on asphalt tile floors. For surfaces you suspect might stain, first spray a small, inconspicuous area and let it dry to see if staining occurs. Widespread or heavy infestations often require the services of a professional pest control applicator. Special Situations Rugs, carpets, furs, and household furnishings require special attention to protect them from clothes moths. However, rugs and furnishings made entirely of synthetic fibers aren't affected; this includes most wall-to-wall carpeting Wool Rugs and Carpets Closely inspect beneath heavy furniture and along carpet edges for infestation. You can dry clean area rugs or hang them out in the sun and then vacuum them. Pull back the edges of infested wall-to-wall carpets, so you can apply an insecticide to both sides. Spray the upper surface of the carpet lightly to reduce the possibility of staining. If the rug pad contains animal hair or wool and hasn't been treated by the manufacturer, spray it as well. It is better to wait until the rug has dried before putting any weight on it. Fur Applying protective sprays to furs isn't recommended. If you store furs at home during the summer, protect them with moth crystals, flakes, or balls, or frequently shake and air the items. Furs in commercial cold storage receive professional care, and you can insure them against damage. Household Furnishings Some furniture, mattresses, and pillows are stuffed with animal products such as hair or feathers. When clothes moths get into the stuffing, you won't be able to control them simply by spraying the outside surface of the item. The best way to eliminate the moths is to fumigate the item with dry ice or have a pest control or storage firm treat the infested item with lethal gas in a fumigation vault. To fumigate an object with dry ice, place the item and the ice into a thick (4 mil) plastic bag. Don't handle dry ice with your bare hands, because it will quickly freeze your skin. If you use a plastic bag with a 30-gallon capacity, a 1/2 - to 1-pound piece of dry ice should be adequate. Seal the bag loosely at the top until all of the dry ice has vaporized; this will allow the air to escape and keep the bag from bursting. When the dry ice is gone, tighten the seal, and let the bag sit for three or four days. Proper fumigation gives quick, satisfactory control and kills all stages of clothes moths, although it doesn't prevent reinfestation. Sometimes felts and hammers in pianos become infested and so badly damaged that it seriously affects the tone and action of the instrument. Contact a piano technician, who might recommend synthetic felt replacements.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "The larvae of several species of clearwing moths (family Sesiidae) are important wood-boring pests in landscapes. Hosts include alder, ash, birch, fir, oak, pine, poplar, sycamore, willow, and stone fruit trees such as apricot, cherry, peach, and plum.",

    "damagePestNote": "Clearwing moth larval feeding can damage the plant’s food- and water-conducting tissues and cause tree bark to become gnarled or rough. With some clearwing species, such as those that attack pine, sycamore, and willow, these host trees tolerate the feeding, which apparently causes no serious harm. Feeding by other species, however, can weaken or kill branches . Branches that larval tunneling has weakened may break and fall, especially during windy weather. Sometimes entire trees may die. Other types of wood-boring insects produce similar damage.",
    "managementPestNote": "Mature woody plants usually tolerate and can recover from the attack of a few clearwing moth larvae. However, the presence of this pest often indicates that plants have been injured, stressed, or neglected. Providing trees with appropriate cultural care is the primary damage prevention strategy. Drought stress leads to attack by borers, although for poplars, willows, and birches inherent susceptibility can lead to clearwing infestations despite sufficient irrigation. In the Central Valley and other hot locations, key management methods are adequate irrigation and whitewashing the trunks of young or heavily pruned trees. To whitewash, apply white interior (not exterior) latex paint diluted with an equal amount of water to trunks to reduce light exposure and sunburn or sunscald damage. Sometimes you can kill larvae by puncturing or crushing them. Heavy infestations of clearwing moths, on the other hand, may warrant treatment with beneficial nematodes to kill larvae, broad-spectrum insecticides to kill adults, or both. Traps containing a clearwing moth sex attractant (pheromone) are used primarily for monitoring. However, these traps or special dispensers (e.g., those resembling twist ties) can be a management tool as well as a detection tool. Continual dispersion of clearwing moth pheromone throughout the mating season reduces the ability of the adult moth to mate. This mating disruption has controlled western poplar clearwing in poplar tree plantations in the state of Washington and has been somewhat effective in reducing Synanthedon spp. (dogwood borer, lesser peach­tree borer, and peachtree borer) populations and damage in commercial orchards in the eastern United States. Mating disruption is relatively expensive and labor intensive and there is no research on effectiveness of clearwing moth mating disruption in California landscapes. Because the method depends on treating a relatively large, contiguous area, mating disruption is probably not suitable for preventing clearwing borer infestation of one or a few scattered trees in a landscape. Monitoring Because other wood-boring insects produce damage resembling that of clearwing moths, the cause should be correctly identified before any control action is taken. If you are planning insecticide applications, use traps to monitor moth emergence, inspect bark for fresh pupal cases, or both. Bark Inspection Immediately before adult moths emerge, clearwing pupae often force about half of their length out of a tunnel and through the surface of damaged bark. Carefully inspect around damaged bark at least once each week, starting before adult emergence is expected. Look for fresh clearwing moth pupal cases protruding from bark, from tree crotches, and around the base of trees. Because old pupal cases can persist for months, remove cases as you find them, then monitor frequently and with care to ensure that any you observe are new ones. With peachtree borer, extensive gumming is evident where infestation occurs but pupal cases generally are not observed because peachtree borer larvae drop from tunnels near the base of the tree and pupate in soil. Traps Traps baited with a pheromone (insect sex attractant) are available for certain clearwing moth species, including ash and peachtree borers. Male clearwing moths drawn to the pheromone dispenser become caught on the trap’s sticky coating. If a pheromone is available for the clearwing borer species of concern (check the websites of insect trap suppliers), hang a trap containing the pheromone about shoulder high on each of two or more trees. Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for maintaining the trap, such as the frequency with which to replace pheromones. Because commercial traps typically attract more than one species of clearwing, identify trapped moths to be certain they are the species that attack your trees before you decide to take control action. Using Traps Because traps can attract moths from a distance, you don’t need to place the traps in infested trees. Place traps in locations that will be convenient to monitor and within about 25 yards of host trees; check the traps once a week for moths. For further assistance identifying whether the moths are a species that attacks your plants, use the adult descriptions here and color photographs in Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs or take the trap containing your moths to the University of California (UC) Cooperative Extension or agricultural commissioner office in your county. It is a good idea to save the identified moths for comparison against additional moths captured. Clearwing moths may be captured in traps almost any time during the growing season. However, each species typically flies in numbers during only a few weeks or months each year. Ash borer and redbelted clearwing adults fly from April through July in California. Peachtree borer, sycamore borer, and western poplar clearwing adults are active primarily from May through July. In Southern California, western poplar clearwing adults have been found in November and February through May. Male moths emerge from the pupal stage before females do and fly primarily around dusk. Females are ready to mate and lay eggs almost immediately after they emerge. Cultural Control Make sure trees receive appropriate and sufficient irrigation and that roots have an adequate volume of uncompacted soil that provides sufficient aeration (oxygen for roots). Protect roots, trunks, and limbs from injury. Keep weed trimmers and lawn mowers away from trunks; using mulch or a ground cover in a several-foot-wide area around the trunk will keep the area free of turf and other vegetation and eliminate the need for mowing. Stake young trees only if needed to protect or support the trunk or anchor the root ball during the first year or so after planting. At least in the Central Valley and other hot locations, whitewash the trunks of young or heavily pruned host trees as discussed above. Because tree wounds attract clearwing moths, avoid pruning live branches unless necessary to develop tree structure or remove severely infested, dying, or hazardous limbs. Except for hazardous limbs that should be removed whenever they appear, decide when to prune based on that tree species’ susceptibility to pruning-related problems. For example, prune only during fall through early winter to minimize the chance of attracting egg-laying clearwing moths and other wood borers. However, stone fruits that are especially susceptible to Eutypa canker and dieback, Eutypa lata, such as apricot and cherry, should be pruned during July or August. For the best time to prune to minimize pest problems, consult Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs, or contact the UC Cooperative Extension or UC Master Gardener Program in your county. Biological Control Various naturally occurring parasites and predators, including the small Apanteles species braconid wasps, will kill clearwing moths. For example, A. paranthrenidis often parasitizes poplar clearwing larvae. Larvae that Apanteles species parasitize have many small, oblong, white cocoons adhering to their body. A minute blackish-brown wasp emerges from each cocoon after the larva dies. The importance of parasites and predators in reducing clearwing moth populations has not been documented, but avoid disrupting natural enemies whenever possible by, for example, not spraying trees, such as sycamores and willows, that tolerate borers, by not spraying foliage when treating bark for clearwings, and by using physical controls for peachtree borer and preventive cultural methods for all species. Nematodes Certain species of beneficial nematodes kill insects. Steinernema carpocapsae and S. feltiae commercially available nematodes are effective against at least some clearwing larvae, including peachtree borer, redbelted clearwing, sycamore borer, and western poplar clearwing. These nematodes are not hazardous to humans, pets, or plants. Instead, they kill only insects. Nematodes can be inconvenient to obtain and usually must be mail ordered. It can be difficult to determine the quality of nematodes and they can be difficult to apply effectively. They are perishable, so store them as directed, usually under cool, dark conditions, and do not store nematodes for long periods of time. It is best to purchase fresh nematodes from a reputable producer or supplier. Using Nematodes Apply nematodes with a squeeze-bottle applicator or 20-ounce oil can at a concentration of 1 million or more nematodes per ounce of distilled water. First, clear the tunnel entrance of frass, then insert the applicator nozzle as far as possible into each gallery. Inject the suspension until it fills the gallery or liquid runs out another hole before plugging the tunnel entrances with rope putty or grafting wax. Agitate the applicator frequently to keep nematodes suspended in the liquid. By adding 2% red or orange latex pigment, you can mark treated tunnels. Thoroughly drenching bark with a nematode spray is more convenient than injecting tunnels, but spraying may be less effective, because nematodes die on dry surfaces.\tMake nematode applications during warm, but not hot, weather (at least 60°F) in spring or fall when borer larvae are actively feeding. Applications are most effective when larval openings are relatively large and moist. Because light and heat kill nematodes, make applications in the evening, especially in hot areas and sunny locations. Nematode-infected larvae can continue to feed and push frass from their tunnels for about one week before dying. A second application one or two weeks after the first can increase the likelihood that borer larvae will become infected. To monitor the effectiveness of squirting in nematodes and plugging tunnels, check that the opening of each gallery is still plugged one week after application. Replug any that have been opened, and spray the plugged openings with bright-colored paint. Wait another week, and check to see if these plugs are intact. If paint no longer covers the gallery opening, the larva hasn’t died. Retreat the gallery. Physical Control During spring or fall, you can sometimes kill peachtree borers and larvae of other clearwing species by carefully using a knife or stiff wire to probe the trunk where gummy frass exudes from the bark. Because it is difficult to know whether puncturing or crushing has actually killed the larvae, reinspect trunks in a week, and probe tunnels again if you observe fresh gum exudate, which indicates a live larva is present. Minimize injuries to bark when probing tunnels and be sure not to create large wounds in cambial tissue. Where the peachtree borer is a problem, remove suckers, and keep vegetation and mulch away from the base of the tree. Bare soil around trunks increases the likelihood you will observe any tunneling. In the Central Valley, bare soil around trunks increases heat and dryness. This reduces the survival of borer eggs and larvae and can prevent the peachtree borer from becoming a pest. Chemical Control If the trees are of high value, making two or more insecticide applications to bark when egg-laying moths are active may reduce future infestations by some clearwing species, including the ash borer, peachtree borer, and western poplar clearwing. If extensive portions of the tree are already dead or if borers have heavily infested trees, spraying may provide little or no benefit, and the tree may need to be removed. Only certain broad-spectrum, residual insecticides (those that persist for weeks) thoroughly sprayed onto bark are potentially effective in preventing clearwing borer attacks. Their use generally requires hiring a licensed pest control applicator as the products available for home users are not effective. Spraying may not be practical on large trees in landscapes in part because of drift or runoff, which can cause pesticide movement offsite that might contaminate surface waters, and the difficulty in effectively timing applications. A sufficiently concentrated pyrethroid, such as certain permethrin products (Astro, Dragnet), can be sprayed on bark to kill adults before they lay eggs and kill hatching larvae before they bore into wood. Direct the spray at the trunk or primary scaffold branches and avoid spraying leaves. Insecticide sprays have not been found to be effective against clearwing larvae beneath bark. Soil or trunk application of systemic insecticides also have not been found to control clearwing moths or their larvae. It requires careful timing for a bark spray to potentially be effective, and the long emergence time of western poplar clearwing further complicates timing. Determine when moths are emerging by frequently examining trunks and limbs, by inspecting pheromone-baited traps, or both, as discussed in the section Monitoring, above. About 10 to 14 days after you first catch pest moths in traps or observe fresh pupal cases, apply a broad-spectrum, residual, contact insecticide to the main trunk, on top and underneath the base of large limbs where they join the main trunk, and on the wounded bark of susceptible trees. Apply sufficient spray to thoroughly wet the bark. For the peachtree borer, allow the spray to run down the lower trunk, and thoroughly wet the soil within several inches of the tree base. There is no need to treat any foliage. Take steps to avoid allowing pesticide to drip down onto hard surfaces or elsewhere that is likely to lead to runoff or washoff that can contaminate water. If fresh pupal cases on bark or adults in traps continue to be found for longer than about one month after the application, a second spray may be warranted. The following year, spraying once or twice again may help to further reduce the infestation. Trees may continue to decline unless you use insecticides in combination with improved tree-care practices.",

    "descriptionPestNote": "Citrus leafminer larvae feed by creating shallow tunnels, or mines, in young leaves of citrus trees. The pest is most commonly found on citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, limes, grapefruit, and other varieties) and closely related plants (kumquat and calamondin). Other mining-type pests (including a citrus peelminer that attacks the fruit and stems of citrus) attack weeds, ornamentals, and crop plants, but citrus leafminer is the only mining insect that commonly attacks citrus leaves. Citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella, was not found in California until 2000 when it was first detected in Imperial County. It soon spread to adjacent counties and continued to move northward. Citrus leafminer now infests most of southern California, the coast as far north as San Luis Obispo County, and the San Joaquin Valley.The citrus leafminer is native to Asia. In the 1940s, it was first noted as a pest in Australia, and in the 1970s it showed up in other major citrus growing areas of the world. It arrived in Florida in 1993 and began making its way westward, invading northern Mexico in the mid-1990s and finally California.",

The pest is most commonly found on citrus (oranges, mandarins, lemons, limes, grapefruit, and other varieties) and closely related plants (kumquat and calamondin). Other mining-type pests (including a citrus peelminer that attacks the fruit and stems of citrus) attack weeds, ornamentals, and crop plants, but citrus leafminer is the only mining insect that commonly attacks citrus leaves. Citrus leafminer, Phyllocnistis citrella, was not found in California until 2000 when it was first detected in Imperial County. It soon spread to adjacent counties and continued to move northward. Citrus leafminer now infests most of southern California, the coast as far north as San Luis Obispo County, and the San Joaquin Valley.The citrus leafminer is native to Asia. In the 1940s, it was first noted as a pest in Australia, and in the 1970s it showed up in other major citrus growing areas of the world. It arrived in Florida in 1993 and began making its way westward, invading northern Mexico in the mid-1990s and finally California.",
    "damagePestNote": "Citrus leafminer can survive as a larva only in the tender, young, shiny leaf flush of citrus and closely related species. Older leaves that have hardened off are not susceptible unless extremely high populations are present. The larvae mine inside the lower or upper surface of newly emerging leaves, causing them to curl and look distorted. Mature trees (more than 4 years old) that have a dense canopy of older foliage to sustain them can tolerate damage on new leaves during part of the growing season with negligible effect on tree growth and fruit yield. Very young trees do not have much mature foliage and they produce more flush year-round, thereby supporting larger citrus leafminer populations. Young trees may experience a reduction in growth. However, even young trees with heavy leafminer populations are unlikely to die. Summer heat in the inland areas of California seems to suppress leafminer populations, but in cooler coastal areas, the insect population may remain high from summer through fall. The flush growth of citrus trees attacked by leafminer will look unsightly, but the best course of action is to leave it alone and let the natural enemies of the citrus leafminer feed on and parasitize the larvae in the mines, rather than trying to control this pest with insecticides. In other areas of the world where the citrus leafminer invasion is long established, the experience has been similar: a high level of damage to citrus in the first year or two is followed by decreasing severity due to natural enemies parasitizing or consuming leafminers. These natural enemies, which are already present in the environment, survive by seeking out mining insects in which to lay their eggs. Eventually, the leafminer populations decline as the population of natural enemies increases. See the Biological Control section for more information.",
    "managementPestNote": "On mature backyard citrus trees, citrus leafminer rarely causes serious damage and management is normally limited to practices that limit succulent growth and protect natural enemies. Very young trees are more vulnerable to injury and insecticide treatment may occasionally be justified. However, available insecticides for backyard trees are not very effective and many products leave residues that kill natural enemies, compounding problems. Pheromone traps are available for detecting leafminer moths.\tPHEROMONE TRAP and LURE SUPPLIERS Available in 2006\tISCA Technologies, Inc. 2060 Chicago Avenue, #C2 Riverside, CA 92507 Tel.

Still under observation is the performance between different types of lures. No endorsement of named products is intended, nor is criticism implied of similar products not mentioned.\tTraps Traps baited with a pheromone (insect sex attractant) are a useful tool for detecting leafminers, determining when moths are flying and depositing eggs, and timing insecticide applications. However, they do not catch enough of the population to be used for control. Only male moths are drawn to the pheromone and become caught in the trap's sticky coating. Hang pheromone traps about shoulder height on a citrus tree. Follow the manufacturer's recommendations for maintaining the trap, such as how often the pheromone dispenser should be replaced. Commercial traps specific to citrus leafminer will attract only citrus leafminer, but other insects may accidentally be caught in the trap. Identify trapped moths before you decide to take a control action. Check traps every week for moths. However, the most important times to check are when the moth is most abundant and citrus is flushing in summer and fall. You may take traps containing moths to your University of California Cooperative Extension office or your county agricultural commissioner's office for identification. Save identified moths for comparison when additional moths are captured later in the season. Biological Control Citrus leafminers are killed by various parasites and predators, including tiny nonstinging, naturally occurring wasps such as Cirrospilus and Pnigalio species. The parasites lay their eggs inside the mine, inside or on top of the leafminer larva. When the parasite egg hatches the parasite larva consumes the leafminer larva. These parasites are very important for reducing citrus leafminer levels. Do not spray citrus with broad-spectrum insecticides and avoid other practices that disrupt natural enemies whenever possible. Using physical controls and preventive cultural methods will also encourage the activities of native natural enemies. You do not need to release parasites, because many native parasite species that attack other leafminer species will also find your citrus trees and attack citrus leafminer. Cultural Control Citrus leafminer moths are attracted to the new flush of citrus trees. Avoid pruning live branches more than once a year, so that the cycles of flushing are uniform and short. Once the leaves harden, the pest will not be able to mine the leaves. Do not prune off leaves damaged by citrus leafminer since undamaged areas of leaves continue to produce food for the tree. Do not apply nitrogen fertilizer at times of the year when leafminer populations are high and flush growth will be severely damaged, such as in the summer and fall. Physical Control Vigorous shoots known as water sprouts often develop on branches and above the graft union on the trunk of mature trees. These shoots grow rapidly and produce new leaves for a prolonged period of time. Where citrus leafminer is a problem, remove water sprouts that might act as a site for the moths to lay eggs (oviposition). Suckers, the vigorous shoots which grow from the trunk below the graft union, should always be removed since they originate from the root stock and do not usually produce desirable fruit. Chemical Control Many insecticides registered for residential use do not effectively control citrus leafminer, because they have difficulty reaching the larvae inside the mines. Leafminer infestations on mature trees rarely if ever require insecticide treatment. If very young or high-value trees are infested, insecticides can be applied to the new foliage when egglaying moths are active or to the soil in advance of new flush growth. Insecticide products that contain the natural insecticides azadirachtin or spinosad show some efficacy against larvae and are safe for natural enemies. However, the residues do not last very long, and these insecticides might need to be reapplied every 7 to 14 days. Application of Green Light Spinosad is limited to 6 times per season. Imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Fruit, Citrus, and Vegetable Insect Control) applied to the ground at the base of citrus trees provides the longest period of control, 1 to 3 months. Imidacloprid should only be applied once a year. Imidacloprid applications should be timed to protect periods of leaf flushing, such as in the spring and fall. Imidacloprid takes 1 to 2 weeks to move from the roots to the leaves, so it should be applied as soon as new flush begins to appear. To protect bees, avoid applying imidacloprid during the period 1 month prior to or during bloom. Removing blossoms before they open on young trees will prevent honey bee exposure to imidacloprid in the nectar/pollen. Frequent use of broad-spectrum insecticides such as malathion, carbaryl, and pyrethroids are not recommended as they will kill beneficial insects and can result in a buildup of whiteflies, scale insects, and other citrus pests.",

    "managementPestNote": "Centipedes seldom need to be controlled unless they become a nuisance in the home. Centipedes are predators and generally play a beneficial role in the garden. Their activities should be encouraged in the yard. Reductions in the number of household centipedes occur when their food source—other household pests—is reduced. Airing out damp places may help. Outdoors, centipede control is aided by removing debris as recommended for millipedes. Millipedes also rarely need to be controlled since they do not cause damage indoors and pose a minimal health hazard. Those that stray indoors can be swept out or picked up and released back outdoors. Sealing cracks and other openings to the outside helps prevent millipedes from entering. Usually invasions are over within a few days. Eliminating moist hiding places around the home will kill or discourage millipedes. Outdoors, this includes removing rotting wood and decaying grass and leaves from around the house’s foundation. This also eliminates millipede food sources. If there is excessive moisture in sub-floor crawl spaces or basements, take measures to dry out these areas. To discourage millipedes in garden areas, reduce mulch and other organic matter and avoid excessive moisture. Although some pesticides are labeled for controlling centipedes, the use of such products is rarely justified for centipede or millipede control.\tWARNING ON THE USE OF CHEMICALS\tREFERENCE Moore WS, Koehler, CS. 1986.

    "descriptionPestNote": "Carpet beetles, which belong to the family of beetles known as dermestids, are pests in warehouses, homes, museums, and other locations where suitable food exists. In California, 3 species of carpet beetles cause serious damage to fabrics, carpets, furs, stored food, and preserved specimens such as taxidermies: the varied carpet beetle (Anthrenus verbasci), the furniture carpet beetle (Anthrenus flavipes), and the black carpet beetle (Attagenus unicolor).",

    "damagePestNote": "Carpet beetle larvae cause damage by feeding on a variety of dead animals and animal products such as wool, silk, leather, fur, hair brushes with natural bristles, pet hair, and feathers; occasionally they feed on stored products such as certain spices and grains. They don’t feed on synthetic fibers. Most of the larval feeding activities occur in dark, undisturbed locations. It’s not always possible to tell from damage whether clothes moths or carpet beetles caused it, but in general carpet beetles are more likely to damage a large area on one portion of a garment or carpet while moth damage more often appears as scattered holes. Also carpet beetle larvae leave brown, shell-like, bristly-looking cast skins when they molt. These skins and a lack of webbing are usually good clues that carpet beetles are the culprits. Sometimes felts and hammers in pianos become infested and so badly damaged that it affects the tone and action of the instrument. Contact a piano technician, who might recommend synthetic felt replacements.",
    "managementPestNote": "Carpet beetles are among the most difficult indoor pests to control because they can find food in obscure places and disperse widely throughout a building. Successful control depends on a combination of sanitation and exclusion. If exclusion and sanitation are successful, insecticide treatments are not required. Carpet beetles frequently fly into homes from flowers in the landscape. A few adult beetles indoors should not be cause for alarm. Management only needs to occur if you find larvae developing in fabrics or other areas in your home. When carpet beetles threaten products in commercial warehouses or storage areas, a monitoring program using sticky traps baited with an appropriate pheromone (a chemical attractant an organism produces to attract others of the same species) is recommended. Sticky traps can also be used in homes where infestations are serious. Traps placed throughout a building can show where beetles are coming from. The traps are also useful for monitoring the effectiveness of control practices. Check traps once or twice a week. You can also use pheromone traps to augment other control methods by attracting adult male beetles in small confined areas. Sticky traps are also available without a pheromone; place these traps on windowsills to trap adults that fly to windows. Plain sticky traps are available in retail stores. Sticky traps baited with a pheromone are available from local pest control operators, pesticide supply distributors, and on the Internet. Pheromone traps are species-specific, so it is important to use one that attracts the species causing your problems. Eliminate the Source Eliminate accumulations of lint, hair, dead insects, and other debris that serve as food for carpet beetles. Throw out badly infested items. Remove old spider webs and bird, rodent, bee, and wasp nests, which can harbor infestations. Examine cut flowers for adult beetles before bringing the flowers inside. Be sure that window screens, doors, and vents are secure to keep carpet beetles from flying in from outdoor sources. Regular and thorough cleaning of rugs, draperies, upholstered furniture, closets, and other locations where carpet beetles congregate is important to both prevent and control these pests. Frequent, thorough vacuuming is an effective way of removing food sources as well as carpet beetle eggs, larvae, and adults. After vacuuming infested areas, dispose of the bag promptly, because it can contain eggs, larvae, or adult insects. Protect fabrics by keeping them clean; food and perspiration stains on fabrics attract carpet beetles. Thoroughly laundering washable items in hot water or dry cleaning them will kill all stages of these insects. This is the most important method for controlling fabric pests in clothing, blankets, and other washable articles. Regularly clean mounted animal specimens such as museum pieces or game trophies, or periodically place them in a freezer for 10 to 14 days. Inspect stored woolens, linens, and furs, and air these items annually in the sun, brushing them thoroughly. If you find an infestation, launder or dry clean these items before returning them to storage. Be sure to seal cleaned items in a protective plastic bag or other suitable container. Some furniture, mattresses, and pillows are stuffed with hair or feathers. When carpet beetles get into the stuffing, you can’t control these insects simply by spraying the outside surface of the item. The best way to eliminate the pests is to look for a pest control, dry cleaning, or storage firm that can treat the infested item with lethal gas in a fumigation vault. Because of the potential hazards to the person applying fumigants, only licensed pest control operators can buy and use them. Proper fumigation gives quick, satisfactory control and kills all stages of fabric pests. It doesn’t prevent reinfestation, however. Protecting Items in Storage To properly store items that are susceptible to carpet beetles, first make sure the items are pest-free then place them in an airtight container, inserting a layer of paper every few inches. On these paper layers you can place moth balls, flakes, or crystals that are labeled for control of carpet beetles on fabrics. These products contain paradichlorobenzene (PDB), also called 1,4-dichlorobenzene, an insecticidal, repellent compound that works as a vapor. Do not let these insecticidal products come in direct contact with plastic buttons, hangers, or garment bags, since the active ingredient can cause the plastic to soften and melt into the fabric. Also, be sure to keep these products out of reach of children and pets, and do not use them where you store unwrapped food or allow them to come into contact with food or cooking utensils. Generally, closets are not airtight and are opened too frequently to hold in vapors. A trunk, chest, box, or garment bag makes a good storage container. Seal any holes or cracks, and if the lid does not fit tightly, seal it with tape, or wrap the entire container in heavy paper and seal it with tape. Alternative methods for controlling carpet beetles in stored items include heating the infested object in an oven for at least 30 minutes at 120°F or higher or enclosing the object in a plastic bag and placing it in a freezer for 2 weeks at temperatures below 18°F. Before using either of these methods, consider if cold or heat will damage the object. For items too fragile to be treated with extreme cold or heat, anoxic treatment (removal of oxygen) can be considered as an option. First, an oxygen-impermeable bag is necessary to contain the infested items. Then, oxygen scavengers (chemicals that absorb oxygen) need to be introduced into the bag to remove oxygen. All developmental stages of carpet beetles can be controlled if atmospheric oxygen levels are maintained below 0.1-0.5% for a period of 8-21 days. However, in addition to the relatively long treatment time, this method requires a properly sealed enclosure and a rather specialized set of materials (oxygen-impermeable film, oxygen indicator, and oxygen scavenger). The effectiveness of cedar chests and closet floors made of cedar is debatable. Some cedar contains an oil that does not affect large larvae but can kill small ones. However, cedar loses this oil as it ages. Having a tightly constructed chest is more important in the long run than the type of wood used to make it. Other Chemical Methods Cleaning is always the best strategy; however, if you have an area or article that is infested that you cannot dry clean or launder, you can apply an insecticide. Find a product that lists carpet beetles on its label, and closely follow the directions. Apply insecticides as spot treatments, and limit application to the edges of floor coverings, beneath rugs and furniture, on the floors and walls of closets, on shelving where susceptible fabrics are stored, in cracks and crevices, and in other areas that accumulate lint. Don’t spray clothing or bedding. When treating attics, wall voids, and other inaccessible places, use insecticidal dusts such as silica aerogel (e.g., CimeXa Insecticide Dust, active ingredient silicon dioxide). Take precautions to avoid inhaling the material. Some dust formulations can adversely affect people who have respiratory problems. Always read and follow label precautions carefully. Closely inspect carpeted areas beneath heavy furniture and along carpet edges for infestation. If live larvae are found, spray both sides of infested carpet if at all possible, applying a lighter spray to the upper surface to reduce the possibility of staining. If the rug pad contains animal hair or wool and hasn’t been treated by the manufacturer, spray it as well. It is better to wait until the rug has dried before putting any weight on it. If you are concerned that sprays might damage expensive broadloom or Oriental rugs, hire an experienced pest control operator or carpet-cleaning company. Instead of insecticide treatment, area rugs can also be taken to dry cleaners who handle rugs. For professional pest management operators, resin strip products containing the volatile active ingredient dichlorvos (DDVP) are available for use in residential areas to treat infested objects in airtight containers. The label directions specify that only licensed pest management professionals can use these products. Dichlorvos evaporates from the resin strip producing vapors that, in sufficient concentration, will kill insects. The vapors build up to the required concentration only in an airtight container, thereby killing the carpet beetles. These resin strips are not to be used in any area where people will be present for extended periods of time, specifically, more than 4 hours at a time. Dichlorvos is classified by the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) as a Group B2, probable human carcinogen. Consumer products containing DDVP are available, but great precaution should be taken when using these products. Do not use these products in areas occupied for more than four hours per day. They are intended for use in closed areas not frequently visited; such as garages, sheds, and storage units. Always read and adhere to the pesticide label. Do not use insecticide sprays around open flames, sparks, or electrical circuits and don’t spray them on asphalt or tile floors. Use only a light application on parquet floors. On linoleums, first spray a small inconspicuous area and let it dry to see if staining occurs. Applying protective sprays to furs is not recommended. If you store furs at home during the summer, either protect them with moth crystals, flakes, or balls, or periodically shake and air them. Furs in commercial storage receive professional care, and you can insure them against damage.\tWARNING ON THE USE OF CHEMICALS\tREFERENCES Mallis, A., D. Moreland, and S. A. Hedges. 2011.

    "contentQuickTips": "Carpet beetles can be found in homes, warehouses, museums, or anywhere else fabric, furs, and feathers are present. The larvae feed on a variety of animal products like wool, leather, and silk, often causing serious damage. Manage carpet beetles by keeping them out of your home and by thoroughly cleaning and removing infested items. What do carpet beetles look like? Adult carpet beetles are small (about 1/8 to 1/10 inch long) and have round bodies and short antennae. They range in color from black to a mix of white, brown, and yellow, depending on the species and age. Larvae are slightly longer than adults and look like fuzzy or hairy maggots. In California, there are three common species: the varied carpet beetle, the furniture carpet beetle, and the black carpet beetle. How did carpet beetles get in my house? Carpet beetle adults are pollen feeders and are found on flowers with abundant pollen like crape myrtle, spiraea, and buckwheat. People often bring carpet beetles into their homes on cut flowers from the garden. Adults can fly in through open windows or doors without screens. Preventing and excluding carpet beetles. Check window screens, doors, and vents to make sure there are no gaps or holes. Look for beetles on windowsills since they are attracted to light. Inspect cut flowers for beetles before bringing them inside. Store clean, pest-free susceptible items in sealed, airtight containers. Protect fabrics by keeping them clean since food and perspiration residues attract carpet beetles. Inspect stored woolens, linens, and furs, and air these items annually in the sun. Create a pest-free storage place in a seldom-opened closet by sealing cracks around the doors, in the walls, and ceiling. Cedar chests are not reliable or effective at repelling pests and the oil dissipates over time. Controlling carpet beetles already in the house. Clean up accumulations of lint, hair, and dead insects. Throw out badly infested items. Remove old spider webs which can harbor infestations. Regularly clean and vacuum rugs, draperies, and upholstered furniture to remove carpet beetles. Wash infested items in hot water or dry-clean them to kill all stages of the insect. What about pesticides? Insecticides may not be necessary if food sources are removed and areas kept clean. For infested items that can’t be washed, spot treat with an insecticide specifically labeled for carpet beetles. Don’t spray clothing or bedding with insecticides. Inspect carpets and spray both sides if live larvae are found. Treat attics, wall voids, and other inaccessible places with an insecticidal dust labeled for carpet beetle treatment. Take precautions to avoid inhaling the material. ",

Locations near riparian areas are more susceptible to infestation.",
    "damagePestNote": "The extensive feeding of carpenter­worms in large branches can cause branches to weaken and break in high winds. The potential for dropping limbs is a major hazard in urban settings. Branch girdling by carpenter­worms, a process that disrupts a tree’s flow of nutrients and water, also can cause dieback of branches.",
    "managementPestNote": "When monitoring for carpenterworm, look for dark sap spots on tree trunks, large quantities of frass and sawdust expelled from galleries, or scarred bark. In older infestations, you might see pupal cases protruding about two-thirds out of the tree bark. Discolored or oozing bark and limb dieback can have other causes, including inappropriate cultural practices, pathogens, and other types of wood-boring insects, including bark beetles (family Scolytidae), clearwing moths (Sesiidae), flatheaded borers (Bupre­stidae), and longhorned borers (Cerambycidae). Because each of these pests requires different management practices, you’ll avoid ineffective control efforts by accurately identifying the cause of unhealthy trees before taking action. For more information, see Pest Notes: Bark Beetles, Pest Notes: Clearwing Moths, and Pests of Landscape Trees and Shrubs. Cultural and Mechanical Control Provide trees with proper cultural care and protect them from injuries. Appropriate irrigation is especially important. Trees are better able to tolerate a few carpenterworms if they are kept vigorous. If heavy carpenterworm infestations are suspected, have a qualified arborist inspect the trees. Because of the strong possibility of limb breakage as a result of carpenterworm feeding, heavily infested branches should be removed back to the point of attachment. In some cases, tree removal might be the best option. It might be possible to kill the larvae by poking a long, sharp wire into the individual galleries, because a larva keeps its gallery open to the outside. This method is most practical when the infestation is small. However, it is difficult to know if the wire has penetrated far enough to kill the larva. To see if there is further larval activity after attempting to kill the larva, clear away any frass and sawdust material and mark the gallery site with a daub of paint. Recheck the site weekly to see if new frass material has been expelled. If so, the larva still is alive. Biological and Chemical Control A very successful biocontrol option is the use of a single treatment of the beneficial nematodes Steinernema feltiae or S. carpocapsae . While using nematodes might require additional monitoring and perhaps retreatment, they can be very effective in controlling carpenterworm infestations. Except for nematodes, available insecticides are not effective against larvae beneath bark. Any other sprays must be aimed at adults, and successful control is difficult to achieve. Carefully monitor the tree bark at least once a week beginning in late winter, then promptly spray bark with an insecticide labeled for trunk and bark treatment when the first new pupal cases appear. There are very few pesticides that are labeled for carpenterworm. Homeowner products that contain a formulation of carbaryl or permethrin are available and might provide some control of the emerging and egg-laying adults if the material is applied when susceptible insects are present. However, because of the prolonged life cycle and varying development rates among individual carpenterworms, it will be necessary to repeatedly inspect bark and respray at intervals over a period of about 4 years or longer. Do not spray trees unless comprehensive resources—including improved cultural care and an improved growing environment—can be provided long-term to reduce the likelihood of carpenterworm reinfestation. Nematode application\tApply nematodes with a squeeze-bottle applicator or 20-ounce oilcan at a concentration of 1 million or more nematodes per ounce of distilled water. First clear the tunnel entrance of frass, then insert the applicator nozzle as far as possible into each gallery. Inject the suspension until the gallery is filled or liquid runs out another hole; then plug the entrances with rope putty or grafting wax. Agitate the applicator frequently to keep nematodes suspended in the liquid. By adding 2% red or orange latex pigment, you can mark treated galleries. Thoroughly drenching bark with a nematode spray is more convenient than injecting tunnels, but spraying probably is less effective, because nematodes die on dry surfaces. Make nematode applications during warm weather (at least 60°F) in spring or fall when carpenterworm larvae are actively feeding. Applications are most effective when larval openings are relatively large and moist. Because light and heat kill nematodes, make applications in the evening, especially in hot areas and sunny locations. Nematode-infected larvae can continue to feed and push frass from their tunnels for about a week before dying. A second application 1 or 2 weeks after the first can increase the likelihood that carpenterworm larvae will become infected. To monitor the effectiveness of the treatment, check that the opening of each gallery is still plugged a week after application. Replug any that have been opened, and spray the plugged openings with bright-colored paint. Wait another week and check to see if these plugs are intact. If the gallery opening no longer is covered with paint, the larva has not died. Re-treat the gallery. Nematodes are not commonly available in garden supply centers and usually must be mail ordered. They are perishable, so store them as directed on the label. Suppliers and more details on nematode use are available at http://oardc.osu.edu/nematodes/. More information about nematodes and their application also is available in Pest Notes: Clearwing Moths .",

    "damagePestNote": "Carpenter bees cause damage to wooden structures by boring into timbers and siding to construct nests. The nests weaken structural wood and leave unsightly holes and stains on building surfaces. Sound, undecayed wood without paint or bark is usually selected for nests. Carpenter bees also frequently attack dead wood on trees or lumber from southern yellow pine, white pine, California redwood, cedar, Douglas fir, cypress, mimosa, mulberry, ash, and pecan trees. They avoid most hardwoods. The presence of carpenter bees around buildings and wooden structures can be annoying or even frightening; however, males cannot sting and females sting only when provoked or handled roughly.",
    "managementPestNote": "Prevention is the main approach to managing carpenter bees. If possible, susceptible exterior parts of a building should be constructed out of hardwoods, which are not normally attacked by the bees for nest building. On all buildings, fill depressions and cracks in wood surfaces so they are less attractive. Paint or varnish exposed surfaces regularly to reduce weathering and attack by bees. Fill unoccupied holes with steel wool and caulk to prevent their reuse. Wait until after bees have emerged before filling the tunnels. Once filled, paint or varnish the repaired surfaces. Protect rough areas, such as ends of timbers, with wire screening or metal flashing. Carpenter bees are generally considered beneficial insects because they help pollinate various crop and noncrop plants. Under most conditions their damage can be successfully managed using the preventive measures described above and insecticide use is not recommended. If infestation is high or risk of damage to structural integrity is great, insecticides may be used to augment other methods of control. To do this, treat tunnels with adult bees in early spring before nesting activity has begun, or in fall after all adult bees have emerged and are settling in to hibernate through the winter. It does little good to treat active nests (those containing eggs, larvae, or pupae) in late spring to summer as indicated by females bringing in loads of pollen, since each brood chamber is sealed with partitions of wood particles at each end which prohibits pesticides from penetrating to the brood. These developing bees can chew their way out after the pesticide is no longer viable. It is best to treat at night when the adults have returned to the tunnel. Wait a day or two after the treatment before sealing the tunnel to make sure all adults have been exposed to the insecticide. Apply dust formulations of insecticides or desiccant dusts into nest holes with a bulb applicator. Dusts containing pyrethrin (Drione Dust), borate or disodium octaborate tetrahydrate (Tim-bor), and pyrethroids including deltamethrin (Bonide Termite and Carpenter Ant Dust) and cyfluthrin (Tempo Dust) are currently labeled for use against carpenter bees. Avoid inhaling these materials, because they can cause serious lung irritation. Many of these products are available only to licensed pest control professionals. After the adults are killed, repair and fill holes with steel wool and caulking, then repaint or varnish the repaired surfaces.",

Carpenter ants can become pests in any urban setting with ornamental shade trees, but they are particularly common in forested foothill and mountain communities.",
    "damagePestNote": "Carpenter ants don’t consume wood like termites but excavate it to make their nests, which in large colonies can consist of an extensive network of galleries and tunnels often beginning in an area where there is damage from water or wood decay. From here they can expand the nest into sound wood and compromise structural integrity. They also commonly nest in wall voids, hollow doors, and insulation. Infestations can even occur in new buildings when land clearing in the surrounding area disturbs established colonies, causing them to move into the structure. In natural settings, they excavate into the heartwood of living trees or into dead trees and stumps. These latter infestations play an important role in the decomposition of wood.",
    "managementPestNote": "There are several nonchemical measures that can help prevent infestations:\tTrim tree branches and shrubs away from structures to prevent access;\tSeal off potential entry points such as where utility lines enter a structure;\tReduce mulch around building perimeters to a depth of 2 to 3 inches to discourage nesting;\tEliminate any earth-to-wood contact of structural elements that might promote wood decay;\tReplace decayed or damaged wood and correct problems that cause decay such as clogged rain gutters or leaky pipes;\tIncrease ventilation to damp areas such as attic or subfloor spaces;\tStore firewood off the ground and several feet away from structures; and\tRemove potential food sources inside a structure and store them in tightly sealed containers.\tBecause ants have a “sweet tooth,” reducing the number of insects that produce honeydew might control ants around structures. For more information on managing these pests, see Pest Notes: Aphids, Giant Whitefly, and Scales. Before attempting to control an infestation using chemicals, inspect the property for potential nesting sites both inside and outside the structure by observing ant activity and following trails, preferably after sunset when carpenter ants are most active. To attract these ants, set out nontoxic baits such as sugar milk (equal parts of sugar and milk) or diced crickets or mealworms (which you can purchase at a pet store or bait shop), then follow the workers back to their nest. Look and listen for other signs of infestation such as sawdust; their excrement, or frass; or a faint rustling in walls, floors, and woodwork. Once you have located a colony, you can apply an insecticide directly into the nest. You may need to drill holes in order to gain access. Insecticide sprays containing pyrethroids, such as permethrin or cyfluthrin, and dusts containing disodium octaborate tetrahydrate or desiccants are effective control products. Desiccants are absorptive powders (diatomaceous earth or silica gel) that destroy insects by removing the protective, waxy outer body layer, causing the ant to dry out, or desiccate. Of the desiccant dusts, diatomaceous earth is readily available in retail stores, but only a licensed pesticide applicator can apply silica gel. Desiccant dusts are low in toxicity to people and don’t lose their effectiveness over time, as long as they remain dry. Avoid inhaling these materials, however, because they can cause serious lung irritation. Perimeter sprays with fipronil are very effective against carpenter ants, but only a licensed applicator can apply them. If toxic baits are used, they should be slow-acting formulations, so the ants carry the toxicant back to the nest and share it with the rest of the colony. This is critical, because only about 10% of the ants are out foraging at any one time. Carpenter ants are finicky, so first attract them to a nontoxic food source like sugar milk or diced crickets or mealworms. After the ants start feeding, replace the nontoxic food source with several different toxic baits that are labeled for ant control, and let them choose the one they prefer. When selecting an insecticide bait, make sure that ants are listed as one of the target pests on the label.",

Toxic baits are available but can pose threats to wildlife, pets, and children, especially in backyard situations. Keep your eye out for gopher mounds. Gophers spend almost all their time underground in their burrow and aren’t commonly seen. Look for mounds of loose dirt that are half circles or crescent-shaped with a plugged hole that is off to one side of the mound. Fresh mounds are the sign of an active gopher. A single gopher can create several mounds a day. In contrast to gopher mounds, mole mounds are circular with a plug in the middle, and ground squirrel holes are unplugged without a mound. Protect plants with underground fencing. Lay hardware cloth or 3⁄4-inch-mesh poultry wire under raised beds before planting. Wire baskets can be installed at planting to protect individual shrubs or trees, leaving enough room for roots to grow. Use traps to reduce the gopher population. Gopher traps are placed underground inside the gopher burrow, so you must use a gopher probe to locate the burrow. Be sure to place traps in active burrows as indicated by fresh mounds. Two common types of traps are pincer traps and box traps. Set traps in tunnels in pairs facing each other. Cover the hole so light doesn’t get in. Check traps often and reset as necessary. Keep trapping until no new mounds are formed. Gopher traps don’t require food baits. Avoid products and methods that aren’t proven. Although many predators feed on gophers, installing owl boxes is unlikely to reduce gopher numbers enough to prevent damage. No repellents currently sold successfully protect plants from gophers. Plants such as gopher purge, castor bean, and garlic haven’t been shown to repel gophers from an area. Frightening devices such as vibrating stakes, ultrasonic devices, and wind-powered pinwheels haven’t been effective in research trials. Fumigation with smoke or gas cartridges isn’t effective, because gophers can seal off their burrows rapidly. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths, damage plants by chewing on leaves, flowers, shoots, and fruit and sometimes other parts of the plant. Caterpillars hidden in rolled leaves or among foliage can be difficult to see or manage. However, many plants, especially perennials, can tolerate substantial leaf damage, so a few leaf-feeding caterpillars often aren’t a concern. Handpicking and natural enemies often provide sufficient control. Early detection and removal prevent excessive damage. Look for feeding holes, excrement, webbed or rolled leaves, caterpillars, and eggs. Prune off rolled or webbed leaves and handpick caterpillars from plants. Destroy the insects by crushing them or by dropping them into soapy water. Caterpillars have many natural enemies. Beneficial insects and other organisms often prevent caterpillar numbers from rising to damaging levels. Most caterpillar species have several species of parasitic wasps or flies that attack them. Look for parasite cocoons next to caterpillars, darkened caterpillar eggs, or exit holes in dead caterpillars. General predators include birds, assassin bugs, lacewings, predaceous ground beetles, and spiders. Naturally occurring diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, or fungi often kill caterpillars. What about pesticides? Use insecticides only when damage is intolerable, nonchemical methods haven't worked, and smaller caterpillars are present. Avoid insecticides that can kill beneficial insects. Don't treat butterfly garden plants, otherwise you'll kill the caterpillars that will become butterflies. Bacillus thuringiensis subspecies kurstaki (Btk) is a microbial insecticide that kills only caterpillars. It’s safe to use near bees, beneficial insects, and wildlife. Caterpillars must feed on treated leaves to be affected. Because Btk is most effective on small, newly hatched caterpillars and breaks down rapidly, treatment timing is critical. Spinosad is a safe microbial-based insecticide, but can have negative impacts on some beneficial insects. Some common leaf-feeding caterpillars",

Seeds may rot before they germinate, shoots may decay before they emerge, or stems of seedlings may rot at the soil line. Damping-off is most common when soil is compacted and conditions are wet and cool. To manage damping-off, plant at the right time, germinate seeds indoors in disease-free soils, and follow planting practices that reduce disease risk. Plant when temperatures are favorable for rapid seedling growth. Don't plant seeds or transplants into cold, wet soil. If you want to start plants earlier, plant seeds indoors and transplant later. Shallow planting will speed up germination outdoors if conditions are marginal. If planting potato seed pieces, be sure soil is at least 50°F. Reduce waterlogging in planting beds by improving drainage Use raised beds. Add soil amendments such as redwood shavings, peat moss, or bark. Avoid using unfinished or green compost, which holds water and promotes disease development. Apply good cultural practices for seedling plants. Don't overwater. Thin plants after they emerge to improve air circulation. Don't overfertilize with nitrogen. Rotate crops to avoid planting the same crops in the same place year after year. Employ good sanitation practices. Use clean pots. Remove and discard diseased plants. For plants grown in pots or cold frames, use steam-treated soil or pasteurized potting mix. Outdoors, consider solarizing soil before planting, a method that uses the sun’s heat and clear plastic to kill soil-borne pests. Use the highest quality seed available. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Integrated pest management (IPM) involves the use of environmentally sound yet effective practices to keep pests from invading or damaging your home, garden, or landscape. IPM usually combines several methods for long-term pest prevention and management without harming you, your family, or the environment. Successful pest management begins with correctly identifying the pest and selecting the appropriate and most effective methods and materials. Pest prevention and control around the home and landscape includes: Monitoring for the presence of pests and their damage. Altering the home or garden environment to deprive pests of food, water, and shelter. Keeping pests out by using barriers, screens, and caulk. Planting pest-resistant or well-adapted plant varieties, such as native plants. Discouraging various pests by modifying the way you design, irrigate, fertilize, and manage your garden. Squashing, trapping, washing off, or pruning out pests; using mulch for weed control. Encouraging beneficial insects to live in your garden. Biological control Most gardens contain far more “good bugs,” or beneficial insects, than pest insects. Beneficial insects and other organisms (also called natural enemies) kill pests and play an important role in IPM. Help beneficials by choosing plants that provide pollen and nectar, by keeping ants out of pest-infested plants, and by avoiding the use of certain pesticides that kill or harm them. Learn to identify the adult and larval stages of common beneficials: Lady beetles (lady bugs): adults and larvae eat aphids. Lacewings: larvae feed on many insect pests; you’ll often see adults around lights. Syrphid flies: larvae eat aphids; adults resemble honey bees and hover around flowers. Parasitic mini-wasps: many species lay their eggs inside pests such as aphids or caterpillars; after hatching, the larvae consume the pest and kill it. Spiders: all spiders feed on insects or other arthropods. What about pesticides? Most pests can be managed without using pesticides. Use pesticides only if nonchemical controls are ineffective and monitoring confirms that pests are reaching intolerable or damaging levels. If pesticides are necessary, use them in combination with the nonchemical methods described above. Choose pesticides carefully. Use the least toxic, yet effective material that targets the pests but has little impact on human health and the environment. Examples of least toxic pesticides include: Soaps and oils Microbials such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) and spinosad Borate products in bait stations for ants Dusts such as borate or silica in cracks or crevices for household pests ",

    "contentQuickTips": "A good nutrient supply is important for a healthy, vigorously growing lawn. Lawns that are discolored, slow growing, or have weeds or other pest problems might not be properly fertilized. Lawn fertilizers usually supply three main nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. However, nitrogen is the only nutrient that turfgrass needs on a regular basis. Too much or improperly applied fertilizer can injure lawns and can contribute to water pollution through runoff. When fertilizing your lawn: Identify the type of grass you have and select the proper fertilizer rate and application timing. Use appropriate application equipment. Deeply water the day before you apply fertilizer. After fertilizing, irrigate just enough to wash the fertilizer off the leaves and into the soil. Keep fertilizer off walkways and bare areas. Apply fertilizer only to planted areas where plant roots can take it up. Apply fertilizers only when grass is actively growing and no more than the recommended rates. Use slow-release fertilizers to minimize leaching. Avoid using fertilizer/pesticide combinations unless the presence of the pest coincides with a scheduled fertilization. How much fertilizer should you use? Fertilizer application depends on turf species, varying from 2 to 4 pounds of actual nitrogen/ year per 1,000 square feet and usually divided into 3 to 4 applications per year. Generally no more than 1 pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet should be applied at one time. To calculate the proper rate for your situation, use the fertilizer calculator in the UC Guide to Healthy Lawns. Adjust your spreader according to manufacturer instructions. Use a mulching mower. Grass clippings left on the lawn after mowing will release valuable nutrients back to the soil so you can use less fertilizer. Prevent fertilizer from polluting waterways. Before watering, sweep any fertilizer on sidewalks, walkways, or driveways back onto lawns—not into street gutters and storm drains. Avoid overwatering to prevent fertilizer and water from running into gutters. Use drop spreaders rather than rotary spreaders to avoid off-target fertilizer application. Read more on UC Guide to Healthy Lawns section . Minimize the use of pesticides that pollute our waterways. Use nonchemical alternatives or less toxic pesticide products whenever possible. Read product labels carefully and follow instructions on proper use, storage, and disposal .",

    "contentQuickTips": "Paying attention to your watering system will help you maintain an attractive, healthy lawn and protect the environment at the same time. Poor watering practices are the main reason for dead and dying areas in lawns and a common source of urban runoff. Runoff can move fertilizer, pesticides, or other hazardous chemicals down storm drains and into our waterways. Landscape with watering in mind. Avoid planting turf species that require frequent watering, such as bluegrass or ryegrass. Design your landscape to minimize water runoff onto hard surfaces and into storm drains. To reduce runoff, install nonirrigated buffer areas, which include water-efficient plants or permeable features, next to sidewalks or on slopes. Aerate heavy or compacted soils so water can easily move down to reach grass roots. Install an irrigation system that you can adjust to properly water areas of your landscape that have different water requirements. Water only when your lawn needs it. Water requirements vary according to turf species, location, and month of the year. Most lawns need water when the top 2 inches of soil have dried out. Use an object such as a screwdriver to probe your soil and measure the depth of the moisture. Shady and sunny areas and different soil types will have different water requirements. Deeper, less frequent watering is best for most lawns. Water only two to three times a week. Make sure your sprinkler system does not produce runoff, especially on slopes. If you see runoff, use shorter watering times and repeat the cycle to allow time for the water to move into the soil. Water early in the morning, when evaporation and wind are minimal. Adjust your watering schedule seasonally, and shut off your irrigation system during rainy weather. Maintain your irrigation system. Check your irrigation system regularly for leaks, broken or misdirected heads, faulty valves, and other malfunctions. Adjust sprinklers to keep water off driveways, sidewalks, and streets. Improve your system with devices such as rotor heads, “smart” (ET) controllers, and soil moisture sensors. Use a “can test” to see how evenly your sprinkler system covers different areas of your lawn and to estimate how long to water. ",

Insecticides can be an important part of integrated pest management; however, some products can worsen pest problems or harm people or wildlife. Other products—often called less toxic pesticides—cause few injuries to people and organisms other than the target pest. The less toxic insecticides listed below should be a first choice when deciding to use pesticides to control insects. Always check product labels to be sure the pesticide is registered for your plant and pest situation. Soaps (potassium salts of fatty acids): Insecticidal soaps control aphids, whiteflies, and mites. To be effective, complete coverage of pests is needed and sometimes a repeat application is also required. Soaps come in easy-to-use spray bottles for small jobs. Insecticidal oils: Oils control aphids, whiteflies, mealybugs, scale insects, spider mites, psyllids, and thrips. Good coverage of pests and plants is required. Don’t apply to water-stressed plants or when temperatures are above 90°F. Petroleum-based oil products include superior, supreme, narrow range, mineral, and horticultural oils. Plant-based oil products include neem and canola oils. Microbial insecticides: Microbials are derived from microorganisms that cause disease only in specific insects. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) subspecies kurstaki (Btk) controls leaf-feeding caterpillars. Bt subspecies israelensis (Bti) controls mosquitoes and fungus gnats. Codling moth granulosis virus (sold as Cyd-X) controls codling moth. Spinosad controls caterpillars, leafminers, and thrips, but it can also harm some beneficial insects. Beneficial nematodes: Nematodes are microscopic worms, and certain types, mostly Steinernema and Heterorhabditis species, attack and kill lawn insects, clearwing moths, and carpenterworms. Because nematodes are living organisms, they are very perishable, so order through the mail to assure freshness. Botanical insecticides: Derived directly from plant materials, botanicals vary greatly in their chemical composition and toxicity, but usually break down in the environment rapidly. Pyrethrins (pyrethrum) are used against a range of insects but are toxic to fish and aquatic organisms. Azadirachtin (from the neem tree but different from neem oil) has limited effectiveness but low toxicity to nontargets. Garlic, hot pepper, peppermint oil, and clove oil are sold as insect repellents to protect plants. Limited information is available about their effectiveness. Avoid these more toxic pesticides: Pyrethroids such as permethrin, cyfluthrin, cypermethrin, and bifenthrin can move into waterways and kill aquatic organisms. Organophosphates such as malathion, disulfoton, and acephate are highly toxic to natural enemies. Carbaryl harms bees, natural enemies, and earthworms. Systemic neonicotinoid insecticides (such as imidacloprid) can be very toxic to bees and parasitic wasps, especially when applied to plants when they are flowering. Metaldehyde, a common snail bait, is toxic to dogs and wildlife. Use iron phosphate baits instead. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Most weed problems in gardens can be managed by hand-weeding, mulching, good garden design, keeping lawns vigorous and competitive, or using other nonchemical methods. However, gardeners sometimes choose to use an herbicide (a chemical weed killer) to control weeds. When using herbicides, follow label directions precisely. Otherwise products will fail to control the weeds, and may damage desirable plants, or limit your ability to replant. Too much herbicide also wastes money and gets carried away in runoff water. Follow herbicide treatments with longer-term nonchemical methods such as installing mulches, modifying irrigation, pulling weeds, or filling cracks. Identify the weed and select the proper herbicide for the application site. Be sure the label lists the weed you want to control. An herbicide will kill all susceptible plants, not just weeds. Make sure the label says it’s safe to use on or around the plants in your lawn, garden, or landscape. Be sure the weeds are in a stage that is susceptible to the herbicide. (See preemergence and postemergence below.) Check the label for the herbicide type. Herbicides that kill most plants they contact are called nonselective. Weed killers that control some kinds of plants but not others are called selective herbicides. Herbicides that control the germinating seeds before plants emerge from the soil are called preemergence herbicides. They won’t control weeds that have already emerged. Use postemergence herbicides to control plants that have already emerged. The younger the weed, the better a postemergence herbicide will work. Some Common Herbicide Active Ingredients and Their Use Active Ingredient 1 Weeds Controlled Where Used Notes Glyphosate Nonselective, postemergence Most As spot treatments on weeds or clumps of weeds Will injure desired plants if spray gets on them. Plant oils including clove, lemongrass, and eugenol Nonselective, postemergence Young broadleaves In cracks and crevices or as spot treatments Organically acceptable. Won’t control older weeds or perennials. Best when temperatures are above 70°F. Trifluralin Selective, preemergence Most annual weeds Gardens and lawns Water or cultivate soil after applying. Use after garden plants are established. Benefin Selective, preemergence Most annual weeds Lawns Often used for crabgrass control. Dithiopyr Selective, preemergence Crabgrass, annual bluegrass, oxalis, spurge,others Lawns Will injure fine fescue and bentgrass. Dicamba Selective, postemergence Broadleaves Lawns Controls clover and other broadleaf weeds in lawns. Fluazifop Selective, postemergence Grasses including bermudagrass In broadleaf groundcovers or landscape beds Apply when grass weeds are actively growing. 2,4-D or 2,4-Dichloro-acetic acid Selective, postemergence Broadleaves Lawns Controls dandelion and other broadleaf weeds in lawns. 1 Some of these active ingredients are sold in combination with other ingredients. Minimize the use of pesticides that pollute our waterways. Use nonchemical alternatives or less toxic pesticide products whenever possible. Read product labels carefully and follow instructions on proper use, storage, and disposal.",

    "contentQuickTips": "A parasite is an organism that lives and feeds in or on a larger animal (host). Nearly all insect pests have at least one parasite that attacks them. Insects that parasitize other invertebrates (sometimes called parasitoids) are parasitic only in their immature stages and kill their host just as they reach maturity. Most insect parasites are host-specific wasps or flies, and many are so small that often you won’t see them. An adult parasite can lay eggs in hundreds of host individuals with a resulting quick reduction in pest numbers. Life cycle of an aphid parasite (left). The adult female wasp (right) lays one egg in each aphid host; the egg develops into a larva, which feeds inside of and kills the aphid. The wasp larva pupates then emerges as an adult wasp. Parasitized aphids (left) die and turn into crusty \"mummies\" that can be black or beige. The hole in the aphid mummy (right) indicates a parasite has emerged. The blackish scale insects on the twig at left are discolored because wasp larvae are developing within. Once parasites mature into adults, they emerge through an exit hole (right). Some whitefly parasites turn hosts black; others do not. A good way to detect parasitization is to look for round exit holes in nymphs. A T-shaped slit indicates that a healthy whitefly emerged (far left). A circular hole indicates a parasite emerged (right). Caterpillar parasites include the Hyposoter exiguae wasp laying an egg in an armyworm (left). Pulling apart parasitized caterpillars can reveal the wasp larva within (right). Other signs of parasitized caterpillars: A Cotesia wasp forms white cocoons (left) outside its redhumped caterpillar host; at right, redhumped caterpillars are discolored and distorted due to a Hyposoter wasp pupating within. Some parasites, such as this Goniozus legneri on a navel orangeworm (left), lay many eggs externally on a host resulting in multiple wasp larvae feeding on a single caterpillar (right). Some parasites attack insect eggs, such as the Trissolcus wasp at left laying eggs in a stink bug egg cluster. The black corn earworm egg at right is dark because a Trichogramma wasp larva is developing inside. White eggs are healthy. Tachinid flies (left) parasitize many types of insects. Tachinid eggs laid on the caterpillar at right will hatch and, as larvae, bore into the host. Some tachinids lay eggs on plants and enter their insect hosts by being eaten. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Prevent runoff of water, pesticides, and fertilizer from your landscape. Trees and shrubs require less fertilizer and less frequent irrigation than lawns. Too much water is the most common cause of decline in landscape trees and shrubs, either through directly killing plants or making them more prone to disease. Fertilizer runoff into storm drains pollutes waterways. Maintain plant health and protect water quality by fertilizing and watering correctly. Fertilize appropriately. Many woody ornamentals such as nonflowering trees and shrubs don’t require fertilizer, even at planting. Determine the actual cause of unhealthy-looking plants before fertilizing. Nutrient deficiency symptoms are often due to unhealthy roots, poor soil conditions, or improper care. Fruit trees, vegetables, and flowering annual plants have variable fertilizer requirements. Follow plant care guidelines carefully. If fertilizer is required, choose a slow-release type, such as organic fertilizers, that will feed the plant throughout the season. Fertilizer should be applied at the drip line of trees and shrubs and not directly on the trunk or crowns. See the illustration on the back of this card. Avoid overfertilizing. Too much fertilizer can result in plant damage, excessive plant growth, and additional water needs by the plant. Water properly to promote plant health and avoid runoff. Water plants during the early morning rather than during the heat of the day or in windy weather. Use drip irrigation and soaker hoses to deliver water only where needed. Check soil moisture before watering. Use mulches on the soil surface to conserve moisture, control weeds, and maintain a uniform soil temperature. Discourage root and crown diseases by watering established trees and shrubs at their drip line. Irrigation scheduling. The amount and frequency of water needed vary greatly, depending on plant species, soil conditions, and the local environment. Newly planted trees and shrubs need more frequent watering for up to two growing seasons until they become well rooted. Once established, plants can be weaned to tolerate less frequent watering. Proper weaning develops deep roots and helps plants better tolerate drought. Water established trees, shrubs, and ground covers deeply but infrequently. In the absence of rain, most trees and shrubs benefit from a once-a-month thorough watering. Normal lawn watering isn’t a substitute for the thorough watering required by the deeper roots of trees and shrubs. For more information about fertilizing, watering, and other lawn care practices, refer to The UC Guide to Healthy Lawns. Minimize the use of pesticides that pollute our waterways. Use nonchemical alternatives or less toxic pesticide products whenever possible. Read product labels carefully and follow instructions on proper use, storage, and disposal .",

    "contentQuickTips": "Create an attractive landscape that reduces the need for pesticides and fertilizers, avoids runoff, and conserves water. An environmentally friendly landscape includes porous materials for walkways and other unplanted areas, good plant choices, proper site preparation, and “smart” irrigation equipment. Install porous surfaces in unplanted areas. Use flagstone, interlocking pavers, or pervious concrete on walkways and patios instead of impermeable surfaces such as concrete and asphalt. Interlocking pavers for driveways or an interceptor drain at the bottom of the driveway collect runoff and divert water into your landscape. Consider gravel, organic mulches, or other materials that allow water to soak into the ground in unplanted areas. Avoid impervious surfaces like concrete, asphalt, and compacted bare soil. Improve water absorption in planted areas. Add organic matter, such as compost, and aerate regularly to reduce compaction. Use perforated drainage lines to allow water to filter into surrounding soils. Install gravel sumps or other percolation areas to keep water from collecting in unwanted areas. Choose plants that conserve water, reduce runoff, and resist pest problems. Plant water-efficient plants, including many native species, to reduce irrigation. Some natives require little to no fertilizer or pest management. Use turfgrasses and pest-resistant plants best adapted to the local climate. Install dense plantings with fibrous root systems along landscape edges to reduce runoff and soil erosion. Create landscape features to collect runoff water. Incorporate long, shallow, grassy depressions, known as swales, to hold large amounts of runoff from driveways, streets, or parking lots. Create low-lying areas in the garden to provide temporary storage for heavy runoff and allow sediment, water, and garden chemicals to soak into the ground. Establish plant species that can survive both wet and drier conditions. Include trees to intercept rainfall. Use rain barrels to collect and store runoff from rooftops for irrigating plants. Add terrace walls or other similar features. Install and properly operate irrigation systems and equipment. Check your irrigation system and make adjustments as needed. Replace old and mismatched sprinklers with low-flow rotor heads. Consider the addition of a “smart” irrigation controller. These are designed to reduce excess irrigation by replacing only the amount of water lost through plant use and evaporation. Install drip systems or soaker hoses for trees, shrubs, and some ground covers. Minimize the use of pesticides that pollute our waterways. Use nonchemical alternatives or less toxic pesticide products whenever possible. Read product labels carefully and follow instructions on proper use, storage, and disposal.",

    "contentQuickTips": "Lady beetles, or “ladybugs,” are round- or half-dome-shaped insects with hard wing covers. About 200 species occur in California and most are predators both as adults and larvae. Some species specialize on aphids or other groups; others have a broader diet. Convergent Lady Beetle, Hippodamia convergens Other Lady Beetles Lady beetle eggs (left) are oblong or spindle-shaped and often yellowish. Larvae (right) are active, have 6 long legs, and resemble tiny alligators. Some species have spines. This is NOT a lady beetle! The long antennae of the spotted cucumber beetle distinguish this plant-feeding pest. Lady beetles have short, clubbed antennae. The ashy gray lady beetle has black spots on its light gray or yellowish wings. A black form with two red spots also occurs. It feeds on aphids and psyllids. During the inactive pupal stage (left), the larva transforms to an adult (right). This species has converging white marks on the thorax. Number of spots may range from 0 to 13. The multicolored Asian lady beetle (left) ranges from red to yellow with no spots or up to 19 spots on the wings. The thorax is often cream colored with black markings. This larger lady beetle feeds on aphids, scales, psyllids and other insects. The vedalia lady beetle (right) eats only cottony cushion scale, a pest of citrus and certain ornamentals, often providing complete biological control. Other Aphid-Feeding Lady Beetles (commonly reddish) The California lady beetle (left) has no spots on its wings and two widely spaced white spots on its thorax, but no white band between its eyes. The twospotted lady beetle (right) is red with two black spots on the wings and two white blotches on a black thorax, or black with four reddish spots on the wings. Axion plagiatum (left) shown here with its pupa, is shiny black with two red spots and feeds on aphids, oak leaf phylloxera, and sycamore scale. The black lady beetle (right), Rhyzobius forestieri, (adult at bottom left and larva in center) and Chilocorus bipustulatus (adult at bottom center and larva at bottom right) are both scale feeders. Three lecanium scales feed near the leaf vein at top. The sevenspotted lady beetle (left) has a black head with two white spots. The ninespotted lady beetle (right) has a white band on its thorax and a pale white band between its eyes. The California population does not have spots. Twenty-spotted lady beetle (left) is about 1/16 inch long. It eats powdery mildew fungus spores and conidia. The mealybug destroyer lady beetle (right) is dark with an orange head and tail. Its wax-covered larva (bottom right) resembles its mealybug prey. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Home and garden pesticides and fertilizers are polluting California's waterways. Problems occur when people pour garden chemicals down drains or when chemical residues wash into gutters, storm drains, and streams by rain, garden watering, or cleaning up with the garden hose. Garden chemicals not only threaten aquatic life; they can also affect the quality of our drinking water. Follow these tips to keep our rivers, creeks, and oceans clean. What can you do to protect water quality? Limit pesticide use by using nonchemical methods or least-toxic pesticides wherever possible. Ask a UC Master Gardener for help with pest problems. Avoid using pyrethroid insecticides. These products, which include bifenthrin, cypermethrin, and permethrin, are among the most toxic to aquatic animals. Control ants by reducing food sources, excluding them from homes, and using baits in containers, instead of spraying. Don't use insecticides for lawn insects unless you are sure insects are causing the damage. Cut back on fertilizer, more is not better. Actively growing turf, flowering shrubs, and some annuals and fruit trees require regular feeding but ornamental trees don’t. Use a mulching mower to recycle lawn clippings and reduce fertilizer applications. Use slow-release fertilizers, including composted organic fertilizers, which are less likely to move into water. Be sure to measure and apply them according to label directions. Don't let fertilizer or pesticides get onto hard surfaces such as sidewalks or driveways. Sweep any material that accidentally lands on hard surfaces back onto the lawn. Dispose of garden chemicals correctly. Never sweep, hose off, or pour leftover pesticides or fertilizers into drains or gutters. Dispose of unused products at your local household hazardous waste site. Call 1-800-CLEANUP (1-800-253-2687) for a disposal site near you! Reduce runoff by making your landscape water efficient Reduce your landscape’s need for water by choosing water-efficient plants and garden designs. Minimize runoff by using mulches in beds and permeable materials for walkways and driveways. Aerate and add organic matter such as compost to heavy or compacted soils. Install terraces or other features on slopes to keep water on site. Check and maintain your irrigation system so water doesn’t run off your landscape onto hard surfaces and into gutters. Improve watering efficiency and distribution by using equipment such as drip irrigation, soaker hoses, and “smart” irrigation controllers and rotor heads. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Pesticides (insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, etc.) are designed to be toxic to the pests they target. When used properly, pesticides can protect your plants or home from damage. However, when the label instructions aren’t followed correctly, plant injury may occur, pests may not be controlled, human health may be impaired, and pesticides may contribute to soil, air, or water pollution. Fertilizer products may also have negative environmental impacts when they get into waterways. Are pesticides necessary to control pests? Use pesticides only when nonchemical methods are ineffective, and pests are reaching intolerable levels, then choose the least toxic, most effective product. Contact your local UC Master Gardener or Cooperative Extension office for help identifying your pest or an alternative pest control method. If you must use garden chemicals: Select least toxic products that target your pest. Examples include bait stations, insecticidal soaps and oils, and microbial insecticides such as Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Buy ready-to-use products when possible, as you don’t have to measure and mix them. Don’t water after applying garden chemicals unless the label tells you to. Never let pesticide or fertilizer run off into storm drains. Avoid applying chemicals outdoors when rain is forecast or when it is windy. Don’t apply pesticides or fertilizers on paved surfaces. When using and storing garden chemicals: Always wear shoes, a long-sleeved shirt, pants, eye protection, and any other equipment listed on the product label. Properly measure concentrated formulations of pesticides. Keep all measuring tools for the garden separate from those used for food. Never apply more product than the amount listed on the label. Always keep chemicals in their original container and store them tightly capped in a locked cabinet out of the reach of children and pets. For help in an emergency, call the California Poison Control System at 1-800-222-1222. Visit calpoison.org for more information. Disposing of pesticides and fertilizers: If you can’t use up your pesticides and fertilizers, consider giving them away. Sewage treatment plants aren’t designed to remove all toxic chemicals from wastewater. Pouring garden chemicals into a storm drain, down the sink, or into the toilet pollutes water and is against the law! The only allowable way to dispose of pesticides is to use them up according to label directions, or to take them to a household hazardous waste site. For the Household Hazardous Waste Disposal site nearest you, call 1-800-CLEANUP (1-800-253-2687) or visit www.earth911.com for more information. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Protect spiders in your garden because they prey on insects and other pests. Most spiders observed in the open during the day are not likely to bite you or cause lasting harm if they do bite you. Spiders whose bites might require you to seek medical attention spend most of their time hidden. Spiders are arachnids, not insects. They have 8 legs and 2 body parts—an abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black widow bites come from mature adult females (left), which can usually be recognized by a red hourglass on the underside of the abdomen. The adult male (right) is lighter-colored and smaller than the female. Crab or flower spiders, such as Misumena vatia, have enlarged front legs. They hunt during the day without webs. Dwarf spiders are tiny, hunt during the day, and produce sheetlike or irregular crisscross webs on surfaces. Funnel weavers spin thick, flattened webs and sit at the center of a silken hole, or funnel, running out to capture prey that contact the web. Often seen are Hololena nedra (left) and the common house spider, Tegenaria species, (right) found in gardens and on walls and ceilings inside the house. Lynx spiders are active hunters that stalk and capture prey. Legs are spiny, and the abdomen is narrowest at the rear. They don’t spin webs. Shown here is a green lynx spider, Peucetia viridans . Jumping spiders hunt during the day, stalking and pouncing on prey. They are hairy, sometimes iridescent, and don’t spin webs. This Phidippus species is eating a house fly. Orb weaver or garden spiders, such as this western spotted orb weaver, Neoscona oaxacensis, (left) often are large and colorful and wait in their webs or nearby for prey to become entangled. They spin elaborate webs in concentric circles in the garden. Sac spiders hide in silk tubes in places such as corners, beneath plants, or on bark, and stalk prey at night. They occur indoors and out and usually are pale, such as this agrarian sac spider, Cheiracanthium inclusum. Wolf spiders have long, hairy legs and are often found running along the ground. They don’t build webs to capture prey but can have a silken retreat. Females carry young on their backs. ",

Common predators that eat garden pests are pictured below. Convergent lady beetle adults (left) and most reddish lady beetle species prefer aphids. Their larvae (right) prefer aphids but sometimes eat whiteflies and other soft-bodied insects. Lady beetle eggs are oblong, widest in their middle, usually yellowish or orange, and can be laid in groups or individually. Syrphid fly larvae eat mostly aphids but also soft-bodied mealybugs, psyllids, and whiteflies. Green lacewing adults (left) eat nectar and pollen. Some species also eat insects. Lacewing larvae (right) feed on mites, eggs, and small insects, especially aphids. Green lacewing eggs are laid on slender stalks in groups (as shown here) or individually, depending on the species. Soldier beetle adults eat mostly aphids. Their soil-dwelling larvae eat beetle and moth eggs and larvae. Predaceous ground beetle adults (left) stalk soil-dwelling insects, such as cutworms and root maggots. Their larvae (right) live on soil and in litter, feeding on almost any invertebrate. Assassin bugs attack almost any insect. Pirate bugs attack mites and any tiny insect, especially thrips. Western predatory mites attack pest mites. Sixspotted thrips attack mostly mites. Spiders, including this crab spider, attack all types of insects. Praying mantids don’t control pests, because they eat both beneficials and pests. Predatory wasps, such as this paper wasp, prey on caterpillars and other insects. Syrphid fly (flower fly, hover fly) adults eat pollen and nectar and resemble honey bees and wasps. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Yellowjacket wasps prey on other insects and scavenge on human food and garbage. Yellowjackets, sometimes called “meat bees,” defend their nests, as do other social wasps and bees, but are more likely to sting if disturbed while foraging. Stings generally cause pain and short-term injury, but some people suffer severe allergic responses. Prevent injury by avoiding wasps and removing food sources. Trapping or nest treatment can reduce yellowjacket populations. Make sure it’s a yellowjacket. Yellowjackets are 1⁄2 to 1 inch long with jagged bright yellow and black stripes. Their narrow “waists” are barely visible. Unlike other common wasps, yellowjackets scavenge on food. They nest in holes in the ground, inside wall cavities, or in hanging nests totally enclosed in gray paper with a single entrance. Honey bees are less brightly striped than yellowjackets and have more hair. They usually aren’t attracted to food (although they may go to sweets) and are unlikely to sting unless trapped or stepped on. They often nest inside cavities in trees or houses. Paper wasps have long slender waists, build paper nests with many open cells under eaves, and are rarely aggressive. Mud daubers are dark-colored and thread-waisted. They build small, hard mud nests and rarely sting. Stay calm to avoid stings. If a wasp lands on you, don’t swat it or run. Wait for it to leave, or gently brush it away. Don’t disturb nests. Wasps flying from a hole in the ground or a building indicate a probable nest. Remove attractive food sources. Keep food, including pet food, covered or indoors. Outdoors, cover soda cans so wasps don’t crawl in. Keep garbage in sealed cans and empty regularly. Pick up and dispose of ripe fruit. Use traps to reduce yellowjacket numbers. Yellow lure traps hung along the perimeter of a property can reduce foraging of some species around patios or picnic areas. Homemade traps using meat bait hung on a string just above soapy water may also be used. Place traps away from areas where people gather, such as picnic tables. What if you find a nest? Ask your Mosquito and Vector Control District if they treat nests, or locate a licensed pest control operator. Nests might be far away and hard to locate. If you choose to treat nests yourself, wear protective clothing on your body, hands, and head. Use an insecticide that shoots a long stream into the nest entrance and is labeled for treating yellowjacket nests. Paper wasp nests shouldn’t require treatment unless they are near human passageways. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Weeds occur in all lawns but seldom become problems in well-managed, healthy turfgrass. Poor maintenance practices — such as improper fertilization, watering, and mowing — can weaken turfgrass and predispose it to weed invasion. Total eradication of weeds isn’t realistic or necessary for most lawns. With good management practices, a lawn can be vigorous and attractive with little or no herbicide use. Why is weed identification important? Different weeds require different management approaches. Many weed species are associated with particular lawn conditions, such as overwatering, compacted soil, or low fertility. Identifying the weed species can give an indication of the underlying lawn care problem, which can be corrected. Visit ipm.ucanr.edu for help identifying weeds. Prevent weed invasions with proper lawn care. Make sure to grow an appropriate turfgrass species for your area. Regularly check sprinkler heads and adjust if needed. Water deeply and infrequently. Mow regularly, and remove no more than one-third of the leaf blade at each mowing. Fertilize up to four times a year with no more than one pound of actual nitrogen per 1,000 square feet per application. If needed, alleviate soil compaction with aeration. Remove thatch if it is more than half an inch thick. See the UC Guide to Healthy Lawns for complete information on lawn care. When weeds invade: Identify the weed species. Determine if there is an underlying lawn care problem such as improper fertilizing, watering, and mowing, and correct it. Remove weeds by hand when they are young and before they flower, set seed, form vegetative parts, or spread into patches. Use herbicides as a last resort, and combine with proper cultural control. If used, choose an herbicide labeled for the species of weed you are trying to control and one that is safe for use on your turf type. Avoid fertilizer products containing herbicides. Renovate or replace weak areas of lawn with vigorous new turf. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Nothing disturbs tidy gardeners more than a weed-filled flower or landscape bed. Weeds will invade any bare or thin area in a landscape. Prevent invasions in new beds with good site preparation. Keep weeds out with an integrated program that includes competitive plants, mulches, and hand removal. Be particularly vigilant about removing aggressive perennial weeds. You rarely should need herbicides in established landscape plantings. Before and right after you plant: Prepare the site and control existing weeds. Dig out weeds or remove by hand. Follow up by irrigating then removing newly emerged weed seedlings right before planting. Solarize the soil if conditions allow. If necessary, use glyphosate or other systemic herbicides for difficult-to-control perennial weeds. Evaluate your soil and amend if needed. Make sure new soil comes from a reputable source and doesn’t contain weed seeds. Establish new plantings as quickly as possible to cover bare areas and shade out weeds. Consider drip irrigation in permanent plantings. Apply mulches. Mulch is the key to weed-free landscaping. Mulches prevent weed seed germination by blocking sunlight. Be sure to properly apply mulch and replenish it to maintain its effectiveness. Organic mulches (e.g., wood chips, bark chips, compost): Attractive but must be replenished. Choose a medium-sized mulch (3/4 inch) and maintain it at an adequate depth (3 to 4 inches). Natural inorganic mulches (e.g., sand, gravel, pebbles): More stable than organic mulches, but difficult to keep clean. Landscape fabrics: Porous and long lasting; vary in how long they remain effective. Cover with organic mulch. Black plastic: Not preferred since it can restrict air and water movement and promote root rots. When weeds invade your landscape: Remove small weeds by hand before they flower and set seed. Use a dandelion knife or similar tool to dig up and destroy all roots and underground parts of perennial weeds without disturbing the soil. Use shallow cultivation or hoeing to remove annual weeds from ornamental plantings. Consider devices such as string trimmers for large landscapes. Apply mulch to weed-free areas to prevent further invasions, and regularly remove new weeds as soon as they emerge. When are herbicides necessary? In general, existing landscape plantings don’t need herbicides; hand weeding and mulching usually provide adequate control. Use herbicides for special-problem situations before establishing new plantings or for difficult-to-control perennial weeds. Herbicides can injure desirable plants in the landscape, so use these products with great care. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "A number of different types of insects can bore into tree trunks and branches as adults or larvae, producing sawdust or sap-filled holes and weakening trees. Most borers can successfully attack only trees that have been stressed by improper irrigation or care, disease, or mechanical injury. However, some invasive insect borers attack healthy trees. Usually by the time a tree is infested with borers, there is little you can do to manage them other than to improve tree vigor, prune out infested branches, or remove the tree. Insecticides can be used to prevent infestations of borers on high-value trees. To avoid a borer attack, keep trees healthy: Plant tree species adapted to your area. Irrigate trees properly and separately from regular lawn watering. Avoid mechanical injuries to trunks and roots. Protect tree trunks and branches from sunburn. Avoid pruning trees when borer adults are flying, usually late winter through late summer. Replace old declining trees. Monitor tree trunks and branches regularly to detect infestations before they become serious. Correct borer identification is essential. Effective management practices vary by insect species. Confirmation of species requires finding the insect, although knowing symptoms and host plant species can help narrow down the possibilities. Many tiny holes in tree trunks and branches may indicate bark beetles; larger open tunnels filled with sawdust-like boring dust (frass) indicate clearwing moths; flatheaded or roundheaded borers leave wet spots and dark stains and D-or 0-shaped emergence holes. Nonchemical ways to manage tree borers: Follow guidelines for keeping trees healthy. Prune out infestations of bark beetles and other boring beetles on branches. If the main trunk is extensively bored, remove the tree and focus on protecting neighboring trees of the same species. Clearwing moth larvae can be killed by probing tunnels with a stiff wire. Apply beneficial Steinernema nematodes to kill clearwing moth larvae. What about pesticides? Limit pesticide (insecticide) use (sprayed or systemic) to protecting healthy trees and combine with other nonchemical methods to improve tree defense. Insecticides are most effective when applied before adults land on the tree to lay eggs on trunks or branches or bore in. Careful timing is essential for success. Insecticides won’t save heavily infested trees because they have limited impact on borers already inside the tree. If treatment is warranted, use persistent insecticides labeled for bark treatment such as carbaryl or certain pyrethroids. Effective insecticides for wood borers are available only to licensed applicators. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Termites are among the pests most feared by homeowners. Observing swarms of flying termites does not always mean your home or building is infested. A professional inspection of the structure is usually required to confirm an infestation. If you suspect your home is infested, call a professional. Regular inspections every 3 to 5 years help detect infestations before they become damaging. Do-it-yourself pesticides for use against termites are generally not effective. Common termites in California Management of each termite species is different. Subterranean: build nests in soil and infest wood that is in contact with soil or access wood via earthen shelter tubes. Dampwood: nest in very moist wood and soil and are most often found in cool, humid areas along the coast. Drywood: nest above ground in relatively dry wood such as lumber, utility poles, fences, and dead limbs on trees. Distinguish winged termites from flying ants. Check the antennae, wings, and waist to confirm that pest insects are termites and not ants. Maintain your building to keep termites out. Keep a 12-inch barrier of smooth concrete, coarse sand, or other inorganic material between the soil surface and structural wood beneath a building. Choose termite-resistant wood or use concrete footers for fences or structures that must contact soil. Remove wood piles, untreated fence posts, and buried scrap wood near structures. Provide ventilation to substructures and keep them dry. Immediately repair foundation cracks, plumbing leaks, faulty grades, and exterior defects in structural wood. Properly finish exterior wood using sealants or paint. If termites invade your home: Destroy any shelter tubes that subterranean termites have built between soil and wood structures. Remove infested wood and eliminate excess moisture. For any suspected or confirmed infestation, contact a professional for help. Pesticides and specialized devices and techniques available only to licensed pest control operators are usually needed to control structural infestations. Termite control methods Most of the proven effective methods in California are for professional use only, so it’s best to hire a professional. Careful inspection is needed to detect and contain termite damage and colonies in order to make best use of localized treatments, especially for drywood termites. Nonchemical tactics such as wood replacement, heat, electrocution, and the use of desiccants should be considered before pesticides. These may be especially useful against drywood termites. Barrier applications of insecticides may be made around structural perimeters by professional applicators through trenching, drilling or rodding. Examples include pyrethroids, as well as insecticides such as fipronil, chlorantraniliprole, and imidacloprid. Injections of insecticidal liquids, dusts, or foams may be made directly to drywood termite galleries or sometimes to shelter tubes of subterranean termites. Desiccants, oils, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, fipronil, and many other active ingredients may be used. Whole-structure fumigation with sulfuryl fluoride may sometimes be necessary when drywood termite infestation and damage are widespread. Bait station systems can be effective in some cases, but may take several months or even years to control the problem and must be followed up with constant monitoring. For more information, consult the Pest Notes : Subterranean and Other Termites and Drywood Termites. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "White powdery growth on leaves and shoots can be a sign of powdery mildew. This disease affects many plants, and one of several fungi can cause it. Manage powdery mildew by using resistant plant varieties and altering the growing environment. In some situations, fungicide treatments might be required for susceptible plant species. Symptoms can vary by plant species. White powdery spots develop on both leaf surfaces and expand as the infection grows. Leaves turn yellow or brown and fall off, exposing the plant or fruit to sunburn. Leaves or shoots can twist or distort. The fruiting parts of vegetables are usually not affected, but apples, grapes, and stone fruits can develop weblike russet scars or corky areas. Powdery mildew is common in warm, dry conditions. Unlike many diseases, powdery mildew doesn’t require moist conditions to grow. Moisture during the spring inhibits growth. Moderate temperatures (60º to 80ºF) and shade encourage the disease. Alter the growing environment to make plants less susceptible. Grow plants in sunny locations. Provide good air circulation by pruning excess foliage. Don’t overfertilize with nitrogen because lush foliage and shade encourage the disease. Plant resistant varieties. Some highly susceptible plants have resistant or less susceptible varieties such as: Ornamentals: crape myrtle, rose, London plane tree, rhododendron, and zinnia. Fruit: apple, raspberry, and peach. Vegetables: melon, pumpkin, squash, cucumber, bean, and pea. Consider nonchemical methods. Wash spores off infected plants with overhead sprinkling. To prevent other disease problems, do this midmorning so moisture dries rapidly. Prune out small infestations and remove infected buds during the dormant season. Quickly remove infected materials so you don’t spread spores. What about pesticides? Some infections may require fungicides. Control mild to moderate infections with horticultural oil or with plant-based oils, such as neem oil. Do not use oils if you have applied sulfur or the temperature is above 90°F. Prevent infections with sulfur products, especially ready-to-use products with soaplike surfactants. These products are not effective after the disease appears. Repeat applications might be necessary. Other fungicides are available. Many must be applied before you see the first sign of disease. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "When well-watered trees or other plants start to wilt, one cause may be root or crown rot caused by soilborne pathogens in the genus Phytophthora. Almost all fruit and nut trees and most ornamental trees and shrubs can develop root or crown rot if the soil around the plant remains moist for prolonged periods. Tomatoes, peppers, eggplant, and other vegetable crops also can be affected. The most important way to prevent Phytophthora root and crown rot is proper irrigation. Leaves appear water-stressed but don’t respond to irrigation. Leaves may turn dull green, yellow, red, or purplish and may wilt. Often only plants in the most poorly drained areas are affected. Unlike plants suffering from water stress, plants don’t recover when irrigated. Symptoms on roots and crowns vary. Darkened areas in the bark around the crown and upper roots may develop, sometimes with gumming. Reddish-brown streaks or zones may be apparent in the inner bark and outer layer of wood. In tomatoes and eggplants, roots develop water- soaked spots that turn brown, and roots may be rotted off. If mushrooms are present or filamental growth is visible within plants, damage is likely due to a fungal disease such as Armillaria root rot, not Phytophthora . Water management is key to preventing rot. Avoid prolonged soil saturation or standing water around tree bases. Adjust sprinkler heads and drip systems, so water doesn’t hit trunks. Provide good soil drainage. Raised beds can be a good solution for vegetables where drainage is a problem. Group plants by irrigation needs and water accordingly. Avoid salinity and water stress between irrigations. Take steps to avoid problems when you plant. Don't plant trees or other plants deeper than they were planted in the nursery, and never cover the graft union with soil or mulch. Select certified nursery stock and resistant rootstocks or varieties when available. Don't maintain irrigated turf around the base of trees. If Phytophthora has been a problem on tomatoes, rotate that area into a nonsusceptible crop such as sweet corn for a year or two. Trees can sometimes be saved if rot is caught early. At the first sign of leaf wilting, examine the tree at the soil line for rot. Cut away any bark that looks affected. Remove soil from around the base of the tree down to the top of the main roots, and allow the crown tissue to dry out. Keep water away from the crown and trunk. Young trees may die rapidly; older trees may survive for several years. ",

    "contentQuickTips": "Pests in Gardens and Landscapes: Quick Tips Asian Citrus Psyllid and Huanglongbing Disease Published 9/18 Read more and see videos on this topic The Asian citrus psyllid (ACP) and the deadly plant disease it spreads, huanglongbing (HLB), threaten citrus trees in backyards and on farms. ACP arrived in Southern California in 2008 and has fully infested that region. HLB disease was first detected in Los Angeles in 2012 and is rapidly spreading in residential areas of southern California. Quarantines have been set up around HLB-infected trees to limit movement of plants and insects out of those areas to slow the spread of HLB. As infected trees are found, they are destroyed. All types of citrus—including oranges, grapefruit, lemons, and mandarins—are affected, as well as a few closely related ornamentals. Concern about HLB and symptoms of the disease. The Asian citrus psyllid insect can spread HLB disease from tree to tree as it flies about and feeds. HLB will kill citrus trees in as little as 5 years. There is no cure or effective control method for HLB. Leaves of infected trees show an asymmetrical yellow mottling with patches of green. Fruit are small, lopsided, fall off the tree easily, and the juice tastes bitter. Inspect your citrus trees for psyllids. Reducing ACP numbers helps to slow the spread of HLB. Check trees monthly in spring through fall; look for psyllid eggs, nymphs, and adults on newly forming leaves. Adults are about the size of an aphid with brownish mottled wings. They feed with their head down and their “tail” in the air. Nymphs are tiny and yellowish and excrete white waxy tubules. Psyllids feed on plant sap and produce sticky honeydew that may be covered with black sooty mold. Other citrus pests (e.g., aphids and soft scales) may cause this symptom too. ACP can damage leaves but doesn't kill trees by itself. The fruit is safe to eat. If you think your tree has HLB or if you find the Asian citrus psyllid in new areas of infestation in central or northern California, contact your agricultural commissioner’s office, or call the California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) Exotic Pest Hotline at 1-800-491-1899 to confirm a find. How can I manage the psyllid and disease? Purchase trees from local reputable nurseries to avoid bringing ACP or HLB into your yard. Don't move citrus plants or clippings out of your area since this can spread ACP or HLB. Tiny parasitic wasps that attack ACP have been released in some areas to help reduce psyllid numbers but aren't likely to stop the spread of HLB disease. Control the ants running up citrus tree trunks. Ants ‘farm’ the sugary honeydew psyllid nymphs produce and protect ACP from the beneficial parasites and predators that kill them. Reduce ACP numbers by treating infested trees with insecticides including oils, soaps, carbaryl, or systemic imidacloprid. Oils and soaps don’t last long so need to be reapplied every few weeks. Carbaryl and imidacloprid are longer lasting but are toxic to bees, so don’t use these products when citrus trees are in bloom. Make sure foliar-applied insecticides reach the new growth where young psyllids hide. Only apply pesticides if ACP has been found on your trees. Support inspections and treatments of your citrus trees by county or state officials. HLB-infected trees must be destroyed to protect the trees around them from becoming infected. Consider removing your residential citrus trees if they are located near an HLB-infected tree. ",
