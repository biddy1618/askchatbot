I thought they were fruit flies because they like the fruit fly trap and like being around fruit (or possibly organic material) and alcohol. The fruit fly traps actually help a bit but doesn't get rid of them. I think there is now eggs in the soil or something. Things I need help with are identifying this type of bug and any remedies to rid of it or at least keep at bay long enough.
