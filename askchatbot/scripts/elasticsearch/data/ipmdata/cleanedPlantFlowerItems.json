Cacti range in height from a few inches to over 50 feet tall. They can be grown as container specimens or in landscapes.",

After 4 to 6 weeks when there are actively growing roots, begin to water thoroughly and let the soil dry completely before watering again. Landscape plantings require full sun and well-drained soils.

Others are shorter and often planted in rock gardens, pathways, or patios. Flowers bloom in early to late spring. They may be oval or star-shaped and may have pointed, rounded, or fringed edges. Colors are very bright and include red, yellow, orange, white, purple, pink, or blends of colors sometimes with distinct markings.",

Tulips prefer rich, sandy soil, but they will do well in any soil as long as it drains fast. They should be planted in fresh soil. Chilling the bulbs 4 to 6 weeks prior to planting will ensure a better bloom. Regular water is required during the growing and blooming period.",
