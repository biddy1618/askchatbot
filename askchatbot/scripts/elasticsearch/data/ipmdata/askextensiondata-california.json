    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Starting on January 1, 2013, California retailers or purchasers of lumber (such as home builders) will be required to charge consumers a 1% tax on solid wood products, but not on furniture, paper, and other wood-based products that have had a lot of manufacturing applied to them before sale. The tax will not be charged when trees are harvested or at the border when they come in to California, but when they are sold as retail products inside the state.   Here is a clip of a legislative analysis of the  bill. II. AUTHORITY AND REFERENCE Assembly Bill Number 1492 (hereafter AB 1492) was developed by a budget subcommittee during the 2012 Legislative Session. Among the provisions in the bill is the creation of a new retail sale assessment of 1% of the sales price for lumber products sold in California. The revenue generated from the assessment will be placed in the newly authorized Timber Regulation and Forest Restoration Fund created in the State Treasury. Monies deposited into the fund are to be expended in support of the regulatory activities of the Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, and other state and local agencies involved in the management of forest lands. The Fund will also be utilized to cover the costs of managing forest resource programs in the state, and for grants to state and local public agencies, qualified nonprofit organizations, and recognized Indian tribes. The grants are intended to fund fire protection and suppression, and restoration activities on timberland.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"A first question would be: Does the EXISTING lawn consist of any undesirable or weedy grasses? If so, sod removal (scenario 1) is likely to leave behind enough of the old grass that it will grow back - along with the new sod. If undesirable or weedy PERENNIAL grasses (bermudagrass, quackgrass, kikuyagrass, etc) are growing in the current lawn, then the use of glyphosate (Roundup) to control them prior to resodding is essential.Obtaining control with Roundup\/glyphosate is more difficult than the second landscaper suggests (whether you go with scenario 1 or 2). To effectively kill perennial grasses (weedy or desirable), it is best to NOT mow the grass \"short\" before applying the herbicide (the more leaf area, the better the control will be). Also, complete kill will take more than \"a few days\". The best results are obtained by making two applications of Roundup, about 10-14 days apart. Total kill of the existing grass may take, in other words, about 3-4 weeks.As for scenario 2 (assuming the grass is totally killed using Roundup...see above...), incorporating killed sod into soil is not as easily accomplished as you might think. It depends on how much grass is present, how much thatch is in the killed turf, the species of grass, etc. It can be VERY difficult to thoroughly incorporate killed grass into soil by tilling. For lawn renovation using sod, the general recommendation is to kill the existing sod and remove (using a sod cutter) a very thin layer of the surface. This leaves most of the topsoil intact and provides a good rooting medium for the new sod.For renovation using SEED, killing the old sod followed by heavy aeration (coring) - and then followed by overseeding - is an acceptable and rapid way to renovate an old lawn. In this scenario, the dead turf is left intact - where it acts as a mulch and seedbed of sorts for the new seed.Refer to this fact sheet for additional information on lawn renovation:http:\/\/www.ext.colostate.edu\/pubs\/garden\/07241.htmlGood luck!Tony Koski",

      },
      {
        "response":"Hi Eric,  If you are replacing bluegrass with bluegrassor bermudagrass with bermudagrassand there are no perennial weedy grasses present, then it is OK to simply remove a thin layer of the sod and then prepare the soil  knowing that you are leaving behind parts of the former grass that will produce new plants after the new sod is planted. Depending on the species of grass now growing there, it may be easier to till the soil after removing the existing sod than it would be to kill the existing sod and try to till in the killed grass. Without seeing your existing lawn in person, it is difficult for me to say for certain.    I hope this clarifies my previous answer? Basically, if the lawn is to be replanted with the same grass (using new sod), then there is probably no reason to kill it with Roundup before cutting it out with a sod cutter.    Thanks,  Tony",

I understand that the issue is the PH of the solution\/vegetable to avoid botulism.  I wish to avoid boiling because it softens the finished peppers.  It is my understanding that altering the PH by using vinegar is how commercial manufacturers avoid having to boil off their product and therefore allowing them to remain crisp",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I am not quite sure what you mean by adding vinegar or citric acid to the salt solution without boiling off when making pickled peppers. First of all what they do commercially is not always recommended for home food preservation. They have different equipment, a laboratory for careful testing etc. We recommend you use tested recipes specific for home food preservation. I am not sure if you are planning to make a quick pickle, one you make right a way and then process or if you want to make a fermented pickle. I would recommend you go to the OSU Extension FCH website and then go to the pickle section and down load PNW 355 Pickling Vegetables. It has a pickled hot pepper recipe on page 16. The book also explans the instructions for low temperature pasteurization which is what they use commercially and the pickles tend to be much crisper than using the traditional boiling water bath canning method.http:\/\/extension.oregonstate.edu\/fch\/food-preservationThanks for using Ask and ExpertNellie Oehler",

        "response":"Dear Nellie,Thank you so much for your expeditious and informative reply to my query,I will try to answer your questions about my questions. I had already downloaded and read the PDF file which you recommend.    For a number of years now, a member of the Rotary Club of which I am a member has been pickling a number of different varieties of hot peppers and selling them as a fund raising project. When he began, he was told by, I believe it was his grandmother, that peppers were sufficiently acid so that he did not have to boil them off when canning them  that a salt pickling solution was sufficient. His pickled peppers are crisp and delicious and no one has ever gotten sick (botulism, etc) from eating them.    This last summer, I got his recipe and put up about 30 jars of my hot peppers one day and they were sitting very beautifully on the counter when my wife, raised on a farm where her mother canned about a million jars of all kinds of things every summer, came home and asked me how long I had boiled them when canning. When I said that I had not, she went ballistic (well not quite ballistic, but she was very adamant) and said that I was going to give everyone who ate one of them botulism.    I went to Google and searched for an answer and found two things  (1) every one of the extension sites warned of dire consequences if peppers were not boiled off and gave recipes for doing so and (2) everyone who had tried those methods said that the result was mushy and not terribly appetizing and not worth the salt, peppers and the heat to boil them off.     So, placed my beauties on the shelf whilst I pondered this situation  continuing to buy luscious, crisp, tasty pepperocinnis from the grocery store. I have a background in food service and a father in law (wife of the aforementioned farm girl) who made garlic dill pickles and marked them for about 50 years so kept thinking about why and how the commercial purveyors were able to create such a nice product when most home canners were not. (I freely will grant that there were a few places where people lauded the quality of their home canned boiled peppers, but, given the paucity of those testimonials and the plethora of those who said it did not work, I suspect that they were either taste challenged or were extremely lucky.)    After considerable contemplation I realized that if the issue were truly acid (the reason why tomatoes and cucumbers are okay to can without boiling), and tasting once again the peppers from my local grocery store and detecting a vinegar flavor in all of them, it became apparent that they solved the PH problem by adding vinegar, citric acid or a combination of the two to their salt solution. Once I came to that realization, and realizing that pool supply and medical supply and yard stores all carry l strips which allow a person to easily test PH in a solution, I believed that I had solved my problem.     All of this I discussed with the aforementioned farm girl. When she still expressed reservations, I decided to write to yall.   I have read a number of web sites  all of which appear to be quotes from each other, almost all of which encourage me to download a PDF file on canning that seems to have been copied almost word for word from another PDF file. While I understand that the conventional wisdom is often wise, I am also aware that if Wilbur and Oroville Wright had been content to accept it without consideration, we would still be crossing the continent by train instead of 747. Your suggestion of low temperature pasteurization is worthy of an attempt, but it appears that any heat will go a long ways towards taking the crisp out of the pickles. My father in law used grape leaves in addition to the salt solution to keep his pickles crisp - I presume it was the natural alum in the leaves, But, that does not address the heat issue.  So, I would like to ask you a large and presumptuous favor. Would you please run my questions up the Extension ladder and ask if there has ever been careful study of the issue of peppers and whether the home canner can safely adjust the PH of the pickling solution with vinegar or some other acid. If not, this might be a great doctoral project for some Home Economics PHD candidate. And, when it is convenient to do so, could I please impose on you to to send me their replies.    I look forward to your reply     Sincerely     Dan M. Appel, Pastor",

        "response":"You pose some very interesting thoughts for which I don't have a good answer other than what I have been taught and studies. I still do not understand what you mean by \"boil off\" the liquid. Do you mean processing in a boiling water bath canner? If you are not doing any heat processing of your pickles and only adding salt then the pickles are fermenting and producing acid. They tend to be more crisp. By the way, peppers and cucumbers are considered low acid foods so if you do not have enough acid you need to process them in a pressure canner to kill the spores of Clostridium botulinum. This surely would make a soggy pickle. I would suggest you send your questions to Elizabeth Andress pHD who is ithe head of the Center for Excellence in Food Preservation for USDA and is out of the University of Georgia.

      {
        "response":"That makes a difference. You are now describing a fermented pickle, not a quick pickles that is the usual process for peppers. If the pickles are made using the fermented process then they have a lot of salt. The salt draws the carbohydrates from the vegetable and the natural lactic acid bacteria then feed on the carbohydrate and produce lactic acid which makes the acid needed to pickle the vegetable. We usually recommend processing those pickles after they have fermented and become sour to stop the fermentation so the pickles don't spoil. That is a quite different method than the quick pickles you find in pickle bulletin. Those are quick pickles and they should have at least as much vinegar as water to be safe and are processed soon after they are made to make them safe. I have been told that even commercially they use the low temperature pasteurization method for their fermented pickles after they have fermented to seal the jars for long keeping.Hope this makes sense.Good luck. Nellie Oehler. . If you are having great luck with the fermented pickles and not processing then I wouldn't worry. Just be sure they don't get soft and slimmy, then throw them away. Keeping them cool after they ferment is a good idea.",

        "response":"The termites likely are not causing damage to the live areas of the tree's wood, but are most likely eating heartwood. That's not a huge loss, but would be worth stopping. Using an exterminator would be the best bet because they have access to longer lasting chemicals that you don't. They likely would focus on treating the soil around the base. If they didn't I would want to know why. They should be trying to form a barrier to termite movement from the soil (where they live) into the tree. The swelling you see in the scalded area is just new wood forming (callus or woundwood). It is good. So treat for the termites and watch for cracks in the trunk for a sign of weakness.",

    "title-question":"Apricot Tree with no Blossoms - Why? Five years ago I purchased 4 dwarf fruit trees from Armstrong Nurseries (Lemon, Orange, Peach and Apricot). I live in Southern California. All my fruit trees do really well in my backyard except for the Apricot tree. My Apricot tree (called Gold Kist) has the best location in my yard. It has full sun throughout the day and the soil soaks in the water real nice. When I first planted my Apricot tree 5 years ago it was a single twig. It produced 4 Apricots that year. The second year it had a few more branches and it produced 2 Apricots. The third year the tree got bigger and I only had a few blossoms but no apricots. The fourth year I only saw two blossoms on the entire tree and again no Apricots. Ipruned the Apricot tree real nice preparing for the fifth year. The tree is about 10 feet tall now and very full with many branches. I fertilized the tree very well but I had absolutely no blossoms this year. The tree is very healthy looking with very green healthy leaves. I have been told several reasons why my tree has not produced any blossoms and feel I am getting the run around every time I go to a different Armstrong nursery asking for an explanation. I have been told not enough fertilizer, too much water, etc... I have watered my tree very little after the rain season so I do not think it would be over watering. I water and fertilize (E.B Stone Organic Fruit Fertilizer)all my fruit trees in my yard the same and all my other trees are producing fruit very nicely. I would appreciate any advice you may have that would help explain why my Apricot tree did not get any blossoms at all this year. Sincerely, Davi",

        "response":"Exposure to hazardous chemicals can definitely harm plants, causing them to wilt and display other symptoms. So it is quite possible that the chlorine could be affecting your grass and plants. Although chlorine is needed by plants in small amounts, too much can result in diminished plant health. Root health is disturbed by chlorine as well. The chlorine in tap water could potentially kill off good bacteria that your plant uses to defend itself against disease. The micro flora and fauna living in the root zone are needed for healthy vigorwithout bacteria, organic nutrients become unavailable to the roots. Therefore, the problems may be a result of the chlorine and subsequent nutrient deficiencies. It may also be resulting from some type of disease or excessive moisture. As for the fluoride, plants tend to accumulate fluoride in their leaves and studies have shown that excessive amounts can cause leaf tissue to die.  Below is a list of potential causes of the problems with your grass and plants andsuggested recommendations.  Possible causes of theproblems:  1. Over watering  2. Over fertilization  3. Chlorinated water affecting bacteria populations  4. Grass or plants may be diseased  5. Too much fluoride in plant leaves  Recommendations:  1. Invest in a water filter and make sure it takes out chlorine, chloramine and fluoride, if possible.  2. Get on a schedule for watering plants, never at night or midday, be careful not to over water.  3. Make sure that you dont have a turf grass disease; if so, get it treated.  4. Perform a soil test on your soil to rule out a nutrient problem with your soil.  5. Make sure that pests are not a problem for wilting plants.  6. Contact your local Extension Office to see if there are any programs that will assist you with installing a rain barrel.",

The next time your vet is out you might suggest that he or she take a feel to confirm that it is the testicle. If your veterinarian is still not convinced they may want to ultrasound the area. Although testicle is the most likely structure you are feeling, occasionally an abscess, fat or the epididymis is felt and mistaken for testicle. In your horse's case it is likely too big, firm and non-painful to be one of these other structures. If the structure you describe is testicle, the colt's castration should proceed as any other routine castration.",

Traps only work to pinpoint a hotspot early in the infestation, once it is well established the trap don't serve any purpose (you already know the moths are there). Source food elimination is the only solution. If your neighbor is using large quantities of bird food that is certainly a good possibility - spilled or stored pet food is a very common source for a variety of \"stored product pests\". The refrigerator is not the source unless dry food has spilled behind it.My only suggestion is to try to work with your neighbor to check and possibly treat the bird seed.",

I've been pruning this species for over ten years and have never seen this type of growth after pruning in any of the other pittosporum shrubs in my yard.This particular plant has been stressed with a scale infection and black mildew on its leaves. However, other plants of the same species that are growing in the same hedge have also suffered from black scale infectionsand are not exhibiting any unusual symptoms.A local nursery advised me to spray the plant with an insecticide\/miticide called \"Take Down Garden Spray.\" This insecticide contains: pyrethrins 0.5%, canola oil 89.5%, and \"other ingredients 10.0%. It is sprayed on the plants in a weak solutiondilutedwith water. I sprayed the plant (and adjacent plants)last summer and fall. The strange growth on this one plantbegan appearing about 2 months ago after pruning. I have lots of other pittosporum plants in my yard and none of the others have this strange new leaves and stemsgrowth pattern. What is happening to this poor plant? Is this plant infected with a contagious organism?Should I destroy this plant? Will the plant recover? I have fed it with an organic fertilizer (Dr. Earth's All Purpose) and watered it to reduce stress.Additional thoughts: Today (May 14, 2013), I spoke with a certified arborist (who I've hired to work with some trees on my property) about the strange growth and showed her the plant. She didn't know what was causing the odd growth, but she wondered whether the canola oil in the pesticide I used on the plant might have introduced some genetic material - assuming the canola oil was extracted from genetically modified canola plants. Is it possible that the oil could have interacted with the plant when I pruned it? Is it possible that the pyrethrins from the insecticide spray ran down the trunk of the plant and entered the soil and caused the mutation when taken up by the roots?Thanks so much for your work to answer the question.

However, in the 20 years that I have been diagnosing plants in Oregon, I've seen that disease (on forsythia) only about 3 times. Since we don't yet have the bacterium here on olive, I would not suggest any sort of preventive sprays. I would strongly suggest though, carefully examining new planting material obtained from areas where olive knot does occur. If any knots are found, do not use any of the material, as plants bundled together with a symptomatic plant would be at risk of developing the disease.I hope this is helpful.Kind regards,M. Putnam",

      {
        "response":"Hi Max --Apricots can be susceptible to various fungi that cause fruit rots, but from your description and photos, that doesn't seem to be what's going on here! Most of those start with spots on the fruit (brown, or maybe reddish ones) that grow and eventually turn into soft spots. Rots also happen when fruit is injured and fungus takes hold in the injury, such as in a fruit that has cracked.Cracking alone can come from irregular water availability, with different varieties of apricots (and other fruits, notoriously tomatoes) being susceptible to different degrees. \"Excess\" water, especially at a time nearing harvest, can cause fruit to swell rapidly and crack.But this still doesn't explain the leathery skin patches! Since you're eating this fruit -- \"delicious\"ly! -- it sounds like the skin problems are neither progressing to a fuzzy mold nor a soft, watery rot.I'm going to \"go out on a limb\" here and suggest your apricot tree may have one, or both, of two physiological (as opposed to disease) issues: First, it's hard to tell from the photos, but if the leathery patches are occuring always on the \"sunny side\" of the fruits exposed to sunlight, there may be some sunscald going on. This can be a byproduct of growing a variety that isn't well-suited to its locale, but can be helped by judicious pruning and blossom thinning to help keep fruits shaded, along with adequate moisture. The other suspect would be a nutrient deficiency, possibly boron. The leaves in the photos appear healthy and happy, but while many nutrient\/fertilization problems affect foliage, a boron deficiency in apricots is known to cause cracking and corky-skinned fruit.Max, I'm going to refer you back to your local UC Extension office in San Luis Obispo. This page: http:\/\/cesanluisobispo.ucanr.edu\/about\/contact\/ gives you the direct contact information of various specialists on staff there. These are the folks that will know about your local conditions (soil nutrient profiles, local apricot problems), and can recommend resources for nutrient testing (foliar, soil) if they feel such may be needed. Good luck -- Here's hoping that with a bit of intervention, your apricots can be as gorgeous as they are tasty!",

        "response":"Max --Yep, these spots are less of a mystery! What you're seeing is classic \"brown rot\" of apricot, caused by Monilinia fructicola (and\/or M. laxa), the most common cause of post-harvest problems, as cited by the University of California at Davis' Post Harvest Technology Center (yes, there is such a place!). Here's their apricot page, click the \"brown rot\" link to see a picture from there:http:\/\/postharvest.ucdavis.edu\/PFfruits\/apricot\/Although post-harvest symptoms can be controlled somewhat with cold storage (since these are your trees, I presume you're not harvesting early!), the fruit is inoculated in the orchard, often at blossom time. This is a scourge of stone fruits everywhere -- here's a very thorough fact sheet on the disease (concentrating mostly on tree and pre-harvest infection) from West Virginia University's Kearneysville Tree Fruit Research and Education Center:http:\/\/www.caf.wvu.edu\/kearneysville\/disease_descriptions\/ombrownr.htmlOrchard sanitation is critical in preventing infection; commercially grown apricots are generally subject to a comprehensive fungicide program. UC-Davis has information on fungicides and application timing, but again you might want to check in with the folks at your local extension, especially regarding growing issues with fungicide resistance, as well as organic alternatives (sulfur-based \"organic\" fungicides are not recommended for apricots). If you take a look at the fungicides-for-apricots page:http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/r5902111.htmlYou'll see there's not much guidance for the home or organically-inclined grower included in the options!Here's hoping you can get all your apricots back to optimum condition -- both on tree and afterwards!",

        "response":"Two things that come to mind that result in apricots not fruiting arefreeze damage or lack of pollination. Apricots are one of the first to bloom in the spring and often get nipped by late spring freezes. Throughout much of the country, cooler weather persisted later than normal and in many cases received those late freezes that killed the fruit buds. Fruit trees are largely pollinated by insects, especially bees. Low bee populations, sometimes caused by bad weatheror the misuse of pesticides at the time of blooming could affect pollination.One other possibility, but I would suspect the former two possibilities first, is the tree had such a heavy load and used up so much energy last year, it didn't have enough energy stored up to produce many this year. We see these cycles in years where there is a bumper crop and the trees were not thinned followed by a year or two with much fewer fruit until the trees can build their reserves and energy back up again.The cherry tree that is not producing may be in a similar situation as the apricot. There are also many diseases and insects that attack fruit trees and this may be what is causing holes in the leaves. You should be sure to identify a specific pest causing the damage before spraying with any pesticides. Scouting ona regular basis for several days may be needed to determine if an insect is present. Samples can also be taken to your extension service if you have one or a local garden center to help you identify the problem.",

        "response":"Basic GOOD information and according to Iowa State University, http:\/\/www.ipm.iastate.edu\/ipm\/hortnews\/1994\/4-6-1994\/ph.html : Before attempting to raise or lower your soil's pH, you should first conduct a soil test to determine your current soil pH. Contact your local county Extension office for advice on collecting and sending a soil sample to a laboratory for analysis.  According to Clemson University in South Carolina,   http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/hgic\/plants\/other\/soils\/hgic1650.html  ,   Two materials commonly used for lowering the soil pH are aluminum sulfate and sulfur. These can be found at a garden supply center. Aluminum sulfate will change the soil pH instantly because the aluminum produces the acidity as soon as it dissolves in the soil. Sulfur, however, requires some time for the conversion to sulfuric acid with the aid of soil bacteria. The conversion rate of the sulfur is dependent on the fineness of the sulfur, the amount of soil moisture, soil temperature and the presence of the bacteria. Depending on these factors, the conversion rate of sulfur may be very slow and take several months if the conditions are not ideal. For this reason, most people use the aluminum sulfate.  Both materials should be worked into the soil after application to be most effective. If these materials are in contact with plant leaves as when applied to a lawn, they should be washed off the leaves immediately after application or a damaging leaf burn may result. Take extreme care not to over-apply the aluminum sulfate or the sulfur.

      {
        "response":"The sewer line may not be a big deal as long as it isn't the oldterra cotta material which was more prone to leaks which invite rooting,and as long as it won't need to be dug up any time soon, which effectively stops growth for affected plants. If your concern is deep rooting, people talk a lot about tap roots, but, once they're established,plants get their water and nutrients primarily from roots in the upper 18 inches of soil, so depth may not be a deal breaker. Also, if you can deal with a hedge the height of the fence then consider a vine that would climb up and through the chain link. I have some grape vines on a fence and love it when theyyield some fruit, but they aren't evergreen like the jasmine further down the fence.I didfind some great resources for you...http:\/\/arboretum.ucdavis.edu\/plant_search.aspxhas a plant search feature so I put in medium native shrub and there were some great looking results.Also, you can call a Master Gardener at your local Cooperative Extension office who may have a list made up already.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi --There are many plants that go by the common name of \"jasmine\". Most are members of the genus Jasminum -- the \"true\" jasmines, in the olive family -- but one of the most widely cultivated \"jasmine\" isn't a true jasmine at all. Instead, Trachelospermum jasminoides, with common monikers including \"star jasmine\" and \"confederate jasmine\", come from the dogbane family. Both are grown both outdoors in the ground and in containers, which can be moved indoors as climate requires.South Carolina's Clemson University extension has a good overview of some commonly cultivated jasmines, \"true\" and otherwise: http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/hgic\/plants\/landscape\/groundcovers\/hgic1106.htmlThough some of these are more tropical than others, in general both the true jasmines and T. jasminoides need plentiful sun to flower freely, as well as some humidity. Without knowing which kind of \"jasmine\" you have or the conditions in which it's growing, it's hard to say why yours may be misbehaving, but when a plant is otherwise healthy, sufficient light is always a likely suspect. Depending on what you're using for fertilizer and when \"every so often\" is, you may have some issues there: Too much nitrogen can foster leafy growth at the expense of blooms, and plants should not be fed during a resting period (generally late fall\/winter, resume in early spring). Use a balanced fertilizer, e.g. 5-5-5 for N-P-K, or one that's a bit higher for P (these are often sold as \"rose\" or \"blooming plant\" food). Container plants will need more frequent, lower-strength fertilization than plants in-ground.This should give you a few tips toward coaxing your \"jasmine\" into bloom! If you have more information on type of jasmine and growing conditions, we may be able to answer in greater detail. Good luck!",

I don't know if you have the ability to have a soil test done or not, but that would be my first recommendation. If the phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels in the soil are low compared to the nitrogen content, then you may be able to add P and K to the soil to increase flowering and fruiting.Did the Scott's brand garden soil have a fertilizer added to the mix? It should say on the packaging. It may even say feeds for ___ months. After that many months the nitrogen (N) should be out of the soil and your garden should start producing again without adding any extra nutrients. The short answer to your question is to leach the N out of the soil so the P and K and trigger the plants to flower.",

        "response":"While I am not familiar with the plant, I can tell you that your plants probably have a fungus caused by moisture. First, try to buy seeds\/plants that are resistant to common pest problems. (Good websites and seed catalogues generally provide this information.) Secondly, and it sounds like you are doing this, butavoid wetting the foliage when watering. Water in the morning if possible, and use a soaker hose or apply by hand. The adage is: Water the soil, not the plant.Lastly, do not use vinegar on plants. Vinegar dehydrates plants and is used as a week killer. Instead, spray all leaf surfaces with the following solution early in the day:1 teaspoon baking soda dissolved in a quart of warm water. Add a teaspoon of liquidsoap (not liquiddetergent or antibacterial types) to help it stick to the leaves. This spray should be re-applied after a rain.Happy gardening,",

      {
        "response":"Wow -- it sounds like your daughter's behavior is really frustrating to you. I can empathize; dealing with a 1-year-old's attempts to become an independent person can be challenging.The good news is that your daughter is not a bad person; the behavior you are describing is very typical of children this age. (That doesn't make it any less frustrating to you, but it may reassure you a bit.) One of the biggest developmental \"tasks\" for children between ages 1 and about 3 is to begin seeing themselves as independent people. Toddlers have a need to control their world, and they do this by testing limits. You are doing exactly the right thing by setting rules (e.g., no hitting people) and enforcing those limits when she breaks them. When you take the toy away, she is learning that her actions have consequences. It may not seem like she is learning very quickly, but remember that toddlers need to have the same thing repeated over and over again before they truly learn it.When your daughter misbehaves, I would suggest using very simple language to stop her. \"No hitting people. Hitting hurts.\" is a simple set of phrases that communicate clearly that the behavior is not appropriate. You could also try telling her, \"I'm putting the toy away because you hit me with it.\" She may cry because she's frustrated at losing the toy, but she will also begin to see the connection between her action and losing the toy.The other key is to give her something else to do instead of the misbehavior. If she really wants to hit something, give her a pillow or metal pot or drum or something else that's safe to hit. You can redirect her when she tries to hit you by saying, \"No hitting people. You can hit this box if you want to hit something.\"It sounds like this behavior could also be an attempt to get your attention when she thinks you are distracted. If you don't do this already, try setting aside specific times to play with her -- and be sure you focus your whole attention on her during those times. Put down the smart phone, turn off the TV, and don't try to do something else while she plays. That focused time will give her more of your attention, which may reduce any attention-getting behaviors. Crying can also be a way of getting attention. Pay attention to crying that tells you she is scared or hurt, but if she is in a safe environment, you can let her calm herself down. Also keep in mind that she is still learning language, so keep your explanations short and simple.Above all, remain calm and be consistent. Toddler behavior can be incredibly frustrating. Take a deep breath (or two, or three) and speak to her in a calm voice. Gently but firmly redirect her to a more appropriate activity. And if you can identify times or situations where she is most likely to act out, think of ways to prevent the behavior from happening. If she is most likely to hit you when she is tired, for example,be sure you put her to bed before she gets that frustrated.This, too, shall pass as your daughter learns language and more socially appropriate actions to express her frustration. Hang in there, and let me know if I can help you further. Good luck!",

        "response":"Here is some information about 'Rebel' from the University of Georgia, which released this variety (p. 14, http:\/\/www.smallfruits.org\/Blueberries\/production\/06bbcvproc_Nov0206.pdf): \"[Rebel] Plants are self-fertile to a degree, but should be planted with other southern highbush blueberry cultivars with a similar time of bloom for cross-pollination (Emerald and Star recommended).\"The same source mentions that 'Rebel' only requires 400 - 450 hrs of chilling (temps below 45 F) to bloom. It appears that locations in Fresno Co. get about 880 - 1025 chilling hrs, on average (http:\/\/fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu\/Weather_Services\/chilling_accumulation_models\/Chill_Calculators\/). In many parts of the country, when a plant requires a low number of chilling hours, relative to what the the area experiences, we have to be concerned about the plant blooming early and then having its flowers killed by late cold events (~28 F or lower) and thus not having fruit. However, I realize that the winter temperatures in central CA are fairly moderate, so this might not be a concern for you. If you aren't sure if this is a problem in your area, you might want to check with your local extension office (http:\/\/cefresno.ucdavis.edu\/) before buying additional bushes. Of the two mentioned pollenizers for 'Rebel', 'Star' requires more chilling hours.Univ. of California Cooperative Extension has blueberry recommendations for home gardeners here: http:\/\/ucanr.edu\/sites\/gardenweb\/Berries\/Blueberries\/Univ. of FL has a publication specifically about growing fruit plants in containers--http:\/\/edis.ifas.ufl.edu\/mg243.

I am in the process of getting surgery to have half a kidney removed. In March i had a heart attack from stress of caring for husband with dementia and other severe health issues. during my stay a test revealed a 10mm mass in my kidney. we need help financially, urgently. i am about to lose PG&amp;E (medical need based) because bill is higher than standard limit for local charities. $4000.00. We lost two months of my caregiver pay because of my daughters FASFA money for school. that is when I had heart attack. this set us back two months on rent. I need my surgery, but my husband passed away two weeks ago leaving no income for my family. I have no problem working as a caregiver , but need help while we go through four month process to receive adult child ssi for my daughter. I am desperate and local Charities will not help me because i am not currently employed and PG7E is above the limit. By trying to do it ourselves and not asking for help earlier, we are in big trouble , right now. $ our immediate need is 2890.00 back rent or we can use to move if need be, and A little over 4000.00 for PG&amp;E that was not shut off due to medical necessity. Our PG7E will be normal now that my honey has passed. i am hoping i will be able to have the surgery and work as much as it takes to get on our feet. I am in no way lazy, and never count on others financially. I prefer giving, actually enjoy it very much. This is a very hard place to be. Please take extra steps to help us or direct us. We are running out of time, health wise and financially. I just don't know where to turn. My families assistance was used up.

The tops are perfect and the vines are thick but the bottoms and lower middle are dried up.

However, this year the plants are also getting wet from the sprinkler not drenched but wet. There is no avoiding it. If it's the sprinkler water causing the problem, why aren't the tops burned up too? If I were watering too much, the toms would be split. So what is the problem? Under watering, nutrition or a pest?

        "response":"Over ripe fruit can begin to ferment very quickly, particularly if the fruit has been visited by flies and wasps either on the tree or after it is picked. The sugars are being changed to something else rapidly. Fermentation obviously isn't all bad - after all we make wine by fermenting fruit. However uncontrolled fermentation in over ripe fruit can produce high levels of acetic acid, the main ingredient in vinegar. Bacteria and mold can get into the fruit as well and produce off flavors. Also there will be a break down in pectin, which is needed for the jelling process. Once fruit gets mushy the pectin is mostly gone. It is not so much a question of safety as quality and taste of the final product.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Warning! Honey have been linked to the use of imidacloprid since it stays in the olant for several years. Azadirachtin (Azatin, Safer BioNeem), neem oil (Green Light Garden Safe), insecticidal soap (potassium salts of           fatty acids, such as Safer), and horticultural oil (an insecticide labeled narrow range, superior,           or supreme oil, such as Sunspray or Volck) can provide temporary control of psyllids that are directly contacted           by the spray. Infested new growth must be thoroughly covered with the insecticide spray. The low toxicity and short           persistence of these organically acceptable materials does not kill natural enemies that migrate           in after the spray has dried, so application of these materials early in the season before natural enemies build           up and migrate from nearby unsprayed plants is compatible with later-season biological control. However, an additional           treatment may be necessary within several weeks if psyllid populations rebound and the plants produce a new growth           flush. \t\t           Insecticide Application          Time an insecticide application to kill eggs and young nymphs before damage or           psyllids become abundant. Monitor when susceptible new growth or adult psyllids or both become abundant as discussed           in Monitoring. Treat soon after a sharp increase in adult numbers is observed on sticky traps or in beat samples,           or when significant numbers of eggs are observed on leaves and shoots. Continue monitoring after treatment. If           natural enemies as well as psyllids become abundant, delay reapplication and continue to monitor periodically to           determine if populations have declined and spraying can be avoided. \t\t           Systemic Insecticides          Systemic insecticides are the most practical, effective materials for controlling           psyllids that infest large trees. In situations where integrated pest management compatible contact sprays are           inadequate, the systemic insecticide imidacloprid (Bayer Advanced Garden Tree &amp; Shrub Insect Control, Merit)           is available to both homeowners and professional applicators. It may provide season-long control if applied in           late winter or spring before psyllid populations dramatically increase. Imidacloprid can be applied as a foliar           spray or soil injection or drench. It can be injected directly into trunks if their diameter is relatively large.           Drenching or injecting soil beneath infested plants is probably the best application method, especially when treating           hedges, shrubs, or clumped groups of plants.  \t\t           Imidacloprid applied to soil beneath flowering plants may  move to nectar and poison parasites. However, in comparison           with an application to soil, spraying foliage can be more  toxic to natural enemies and less effective against psyllids.           In comparison with injecting or implanting trunks, treating  soil avoids mechanically wounding trunks and potentially           spreading plant pathogens on contaminated tools. The home-use  product is measured into a bucket, diluted with water,           and poured onto soil near trunks, as directed on the label. Be  aware that imidacloprid application has sometimes           contributed to outbreaks of spider mites and certain other  pests. \t\t           The microbial abamectin (Abacide, Avid) can be injected into trees or sprayed on foliage by licensed applicators.           Abamectin is effective against pear psylla, but its effectiveness against psyllid species that infest ornamentals           is uncertain. \t\t           Carbamates (such as carbaryl), the foliar-sprayed systemic  organophosphate acephate (Orthene T, T&amp;O Spray), nonsystemic           organophosphates (malathion), and pyrethroids (fluvalinate,  permethrin) also can be applied, but these insecticides           are not recommended. Spraying these broad-spectrum, more  persistent insecticides kills many natural enemies. These           materials generally are not as effective in controlling  psyllids as imidacloprid discussed above. Persistent insecticides           contaminate urban surface water runoff and municipal  wastewater because of their use around homes and in landscapes.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi Stephanie,Growing citrus trees in containers can pose some unique challenges; challenges that you typically do not encounter when growing them in the ground. Issues with fertilization, build-up of salts, and inadequate root zone are possible reasons for poor performance with a containerized plant, especially a citrus tree. The following tips should help you with your plants.  Citrus trees have a very hardy appetite (meaning they need continuous supply of nutrients). Ideally, they should be fertilized with a \"complete\" slow-release fertilizer with micronutrients, three times a year (1x January - February, 1x early May, &amp; 1x July). A \"complete\" slow-release fertilizer is a fertilizer that has nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium (the 3 numbers on the front of the fertilizer container), that is formulated (to feed) for 3-4 months (something like Osmocote 15-9-12 plus minors). If you cannot find that, a fertilizer that has controlled-release nitrogen like a 14-14-14 is OK; but be sure once a year spray the trees with chelated iron product. The reason for this is that containerized citrus trees do have a tendency to suffer from iron deficiencies (along with occasional zinc and magnesium deficiencies, as well). Many of the organic fertilizers will (also) work; the only problem with using them, is that they (quite often) are slow to break down in the soil. Apply approximately 1\/2 teaspoon of fertilizer per gallon of potting soil in the container (a gallon of potting soil is approx. 0.18 cubic feet). Another major problem with containerized citrus is inadequate root zone. Most citrus trees have a rather large root system (as related to the portion above ground). Many times, when I have seen problems with containerized citrus trees in the past and the problem wasn't related to fertilization, it was due to the tree being root-bound (where the roots did not have adequate room to grow and develop). If the trees have been in the containers for very long, this could be a problem. By removing the trees from their containers, you should not be able to see the roots of the trees trying to circle on the outside of the root ball (against the inside of container). If this is occurring, re-pot the trees in larger containers - teasing the roots out and planting in a good quality potting soil, preferably mixed with some compost or composted manure. Be careful if using manure, although it is an excellent source for micronutrients, it can potentially cause burn and\/or salts damage if improperly composted. Inadequate sunlight can also be a problem. Citrus trees thrive on intense sunlight. Ideally, they should be placed in areas where they can receive at least 6 hours of direct sunlight daily. The best location for this is on the south or west side of your house when it can get optimal sunlight.Barring any type of disease or insect problems, the three previously mentioned tips should help your citrus trees to thrive.

      {
        "response":"Hi,I was given your question about lemon trees but in CT they are not a common plant. Since they are being grown in pots, there could be lots of reasons why they are not happy - under or over watering, under or over fertilizing, too high or low pH (they like it 5 to 6.5 or so), not enough sunlight, too much sunlight, extreme temperatures, etc. One would have to have more information than just a picture to try to help you figure out what is going wrong. One suggestion might be to call your local CA Master Gardener. If you go to the following website you can find the Master Gardener office in your county. http:\/\/camastergardeners.ucdavis.edu\/California_Counties_MG_Websites\/ Another suggestion is to check out the website of the California Botanical Garden.They also had information on growing lemons in containers. You might also considertesting the soil or the leaf tissues to see if plants are getting adequate nutrition and for pH. Hope this helps but more information would be needed tocome up with somesuggestons of why your plants may be doing poorly. It might be better for you to call and converse with a CA Master Gardener.

These will require less water than plants that are less heat tolerant. The following is adescription of heat intolerance in plantsfrom the American Horticultural Societies:The effects of heat damage are more subtle than those of extreme cold, which will kill a plant instantly. Heat damage can first appear in many different parts of the plant: Flower buds may wither, leaves may droop or become more attractive to insects, chlorophyll may disappear so that leaves appear white or brown, or roots may cease growing. Plant death from heat is slow and lingering. The plant may survive in a stunted or chlorotic state for several years. When desiccation reaches a high enough level, the enzymes that control growth are deactivated and the plant dies.",

You want to establish your lawn now in the fall so the new grass get off to a good start. You do not want to use any herbicides until the new lawn has gotten off to a good start. next spring you can apply a pre-emergent herbicide to stop the summer annuals and summer grasses from sprouting. These generally need to be applied in the early spring as the ground warms up. If you apply it now you will prevent the grass seeds of the lawn from establishing. whether you can use a particular pre and post emergent herbicide will depend on what type of grass seed you use in the lawn. Bluegrass and other northern lawns are different enough that some materials can kill summer grasses and leave them undamaged.

      {
        "response":"Sticky cotton can cause problems in roller ginning and textile type lubricants were found to improve the throughput through a roller gin under low humidity conditions with drying lint moistures below 5%. Two references from the USDA, ARS Gin Lab are the Effects of Drying Heat and Gin Additives on Sticky Cotton by Hughs, Perkins, and Lalor, Vol. 37(1):5-8, Transactions of the ASABE, and Preliminary Results of Gin Additive Research by Perkins, Hughs, and Lalor, Proceedings of the 1992 Beltwide Conferences, Cotton Ginning Conference, p 548+. They reported that the two textile lubricants that had effect were Milube N-32 by George A. Goulston Co., Monroe, NC, and Hiivol SCF by Forche, Inc., Levelland, TX. Drying temperatures used in seed cotton were 300 degrees F. The low moisture keeps the sugar in a crystalline form  which is not sticky  and allows reasonable processing rates. The lubricants were applied by direct spray in a cross flow blow-box just before the conveyor distributor. Going through the distributor allows further mixing of the lubricant through the seed cotton prior to ginning. At this point the seed cotton (or the fiber on the seed cotton) was dry and the lubricant then helped the roller ginning process. Long term sugar buildup may still occur that requires cleaning affected surfaces. The application rates were in the range of 0.7% and 0.3% by lint weight for the Milube N-32 and the Hiivol SCF respectively.Please let us know if you need additional information. ",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"There are several ways that a grower can \"live\" with crown gall in the vineyard. In the Midwest and Northeast, we train up multiple trunks so if one truck develops a tumor, there are others to support a crop while the disease trunk is removed and a new one trained. Because vines are vegetatively propagated, it is likely that nearly every single vine contains at least a few bacterial cells (the ones that cause crown gall - Agrobacterium vitis), which means that when the conditions are right - such as an injury to the trunk or cane, gall development can occur.The best way to control crown gall is to prevent it from developing, so only grow varieties that are appropriate for your region. Be sure to use a rootstock that is not susceptible to the disease. Be sure to purchase nursery stock that is clean - as in,Agrobacterium vitis-free. These vines were propagated from cell culture under conditions that make it very unlikely there are any bacterial cells in the cuttings. But, those vines do cost more. Also, keep the site well-drained, and try to keep vigor under control.Here are a couple of links that may help:http:\/\/nysipm.cornell.edu\/factsheets\/grapes\/diseases\/crown_gall.pdfhttp:\/\/www.extension.org\/pages\/33098\/crown-gall-of-grapes#.UoQelvmsi-0Good luck!",

If that is the case, it should recover with time.You can minimize future problems by applying a light-colored tree wrap to the trunk in the late autumn and remove it in early spring. Let the occurrence of the first and last frosts of the cool season guide you in placing and removing the tree wrap.If the injury occurred this summer, it is not sunscald as I've described it here - I would then recommend that you take some photographs, both close up and from a small distance, and contact your local Extension office for guidance.Cooperative Extension San Bernardino County             777 East Rialto Avenue             San Bernardino, CA 92415-0730Phone: (909) 387-2171Email: haller@ucdavis.eduBest Wishes!Stevereferences:http:\/\/extension.usu.edu\/files\/publications\/factsheet\/nr_ff_021pr.pdf",

    "title":"Does adding calcium to soil do any good to prevent Blossom End Rot?",
    "title-question":"Does adding calcium to soil do any good to prevent Blossom End Rot, and what are sustainable sources of (soluble) calcium? Love Apple Farms recommends adding egg shells and bone meal to the tomato planting hole to prevent Blossom End Rot. Well, OK, no harm no foul, but in master gardener land, we tell people that uneven watering is the main reason plants do not take up calcium. Followed by high pH (we tell people to do a soil test, and not a DIY home kit, to determine accurately their garden's pH). I'm trying to research if egg shells and bone meal have soluble forms of calcium, since if A) the person is watering evenly and B) pH is normal (around 6.5 and anyway not higher than 7.2 for sure), and the gardener decides to add calcium to the soil, what source of calcium works? Which of those is or are sustainable? (No mining, no manufacturing, ideally generated from home compost or worm bins or local sustainable source.) Scientific references I looked at stated that most soils have adequate amounts of calcium (and lots of other nutrients that people often add, which they don't need to). I don't want to challenge Love Apple Farm since if I had success like she does with tomatoes, then I would get to recommend people put any ol' thing in the planting hole as long as it isn't actually bad for growing! And egg shells are free and sustainable. (Not so much the fresh fish heads and bone meal fertilizer she also recommends, ie not free, especially the fish heads, if you put in sustainably caught fish heads only.) She also recommends with weekly foliar applications of worm tea. My experience, much more limited than Cynthia Sandberg's, is that the amount of sun, the fabulousness of compost (when I started using well composted horse manure, production of everything skyrocketed), and even watering were key in producing perfect beefsteaks. Additional fertilizing seems to be unnecessary, although adding stuff is a fun ritual, and I'm all in favor of fun rituals. One bonds with the plant, and loving the plant you're growing probably also counts for a lot. (Eliding tangent into metaphysics and nature of consciousness.) Sorry to ramble on...

        "response":"Marianne- WOW!You are definitely on the spot with what we teach in Georgia regarding blossom-end rot. Regarding calcium from eggshells....An egg shell takes minimum six years to completely decompose and it is not good for the soil either. Of its total composition, 95% is calcium and others are protein and other organic material. In an egghell....I don't think adding would hurt! Probably a better bet would be to compost them and then add to soil.Below are afew more general tips taken from GA Exension publications.1.Select a planting site that has well-drained soil and is in a sunny location.2.Lime soil to a pH of 6.5. If no lime has been applied in last three years and no soil test is available, broadcast 5 lbs. of garden lime per 100 per square feet. 3.Mix one-half cup of lime with the soil going back into the hole dug for plants. 4.Mix one-half cup of superphosphate (0-46-0) with soil around each plant. 5.Dont overfertilize tomatoes at setting. Mix one cup of 6-12-12 or 5-10-15 into the soil in a 2 by 2 foot area for each plant. 6.For the rest of the summer, fertilize with calcium nitrate rather than ammonium nitrate. 7.Mulch plants with pine needles, old leaves, grass clippings, etc., to conserve water and provide more uniform soil moisture for the plant. 8.Unpruned plants will have less blossom-end rot than severely pruned plants. 9.Do not let soil moisture fluctuate between extremely dry and wet. Irrigate plants thoroughly and often enough to maintain a constant, uniform water supply to plants.Blossom-end rot can be a serious problem with tomatoes. The main symptom is a dark, sunken water-soaked area at the blossom end of the fruit. This physiological disorder is associated with a low concentration of calcium in the fruit. Blossom-end rot is also induced more often when there is drought stress followed by  excessive soil moisture; these fluctuations reduce uptake and movement of available calcium.To manage blossom-end rot: Maintain the soil pH between 6.2 to 6.8 and supply adequate levels of calcium through  applications of dolimitic limestone or gypsum. Avoid drought stress and extreme moisture fluctuations by using mulch and deep, timely   irrigation once or twice a week. Avoid overfertilizing plants with high ammoniacal nitrogen fertilizers. Excessive nitrogen  can depress the uptake of calcium. Foliar applications of calcium with products such as Blossom End Rot Stop, are only short  term fixes and often work poorly because of poor absorption and movement to the fruit area  where it is needed.",

    "question":"1) I'm using a jar and lid with a Plastisol liner which I purchased from Container and Packaging Supply to can pear jam and pear chutney.  Do I screw the lid on tight and then treat these jars the same way that I do a Mason or Ball canning jar with a two piece lid in the hot water bath for 20-25 minutes? \n2) How come other articles say that I can accomplish the same thing in 5-10 minutes in the hot water bath?\n3) Why does your article say that I need a rack to put in the bottom of the pan?\n4) is sterilizing the jars necessary if I am using hot pear preserves directly from the cooking pot into the canning jars? I read an article that states the if you're using the hot water bath method to seal the jars then you only need to use hot water to prep your jars as opposed to the sterilizing method",

      {
        "response":"Here is some information but I'm also going to forward your question to another specialist in case she has additional information.The one-piece lids have not gone through the same testing process as the two-piece lids so we don't have information about their use.The rack helps to ensure that heat is more evenly distributed during processing.Yes, processing is very important - the open kettle method can allow for contamination to occur. Yes, it is important to use clean jars but not necessarily sterilized - for accurate information,we recommend the National Center for Home Food Preservation at this link -http:\/\/nchfp.uga.edu\/I hope this helps.",

        "response":"To add to the previous response, it is probably fine to use the one piece plastisol lids for jams and jellies but because this type of lid has not been thoroughly researched for safety with home canning methods, we cannot recommend their use. I would say that the same general instructions would apply, simmer lids about 10 min. To soften before placing on jar; tighten finger tip tight, not overly tight in order for air to escape and form a vacuum seal.  Once the jars are removed to cool, these lids may take longer than the 2 piece lids to seal (pop). The center button should suction down if a seal has formed. I suggest that you stay with the 2 piece lids in the future. A rack in the bottom of the canner will help prevent broken jars from being too close to the heat source at the bottom of the pot. You can wire canning screw bands together and place in the bottom if you don't have a rack. Thanks for using eXtension.",

These include 10 essential benefits that must be included in the policy, no denials of applicants for pre-existing conditions, and no maximum lifetime or annual pay outs. It is this last point that seems most relevant for this question. There can be no limits on how much is paid out in a given year, or over a lifetime, for any medical care associated with those 10 essential benefits. However, there may be other benefits that an insurance policy covers and it is the insurer, not ACA, that could set limits. So no, there is nothing in ACA that sets limits. If anything, it sets no limits. But mostly, it lets insurance providers offer different policies and once beyond the essential benefits, what those policies include or not is up to the individual insurers.",

      {
        "response":"Hello Twylah- I have a strong suspicion that I am responding too late to your question considering this is Black Friday. My apologies!   Regardless of when you see the water boil, the temperature that must be reached to kill bacteria remains the same. However, this is a tricky question because you want to consider the quality of the cooked meat in addition to the safety. Problems with quality can occur at any elevation but depends on oven temperature, bird size, brining, initial roasting, placement in the oven, covering while roasting, etc. Regardless, the final temperature required to kill pathogens remains the same.   If turkey is cooked at sea level at a low temperature (like 325 degrees F), it will take a long time to reach the 161 degrees F (to reach carry over temperature of 165 degrees F after resting), and will typically dry out the bird. The same sized turkey cooked at sea level with a higher oven temperature (like 400 degrees F) will reach 161 degrees F much sooner and decreasing the chance of dry meat.   If the turkey is cooked at an elevation of 5000 ft, you must consider the influence elevation will have on the time it will take your turkey to cook.   I would be more inclined to raise the temperature of my oven (400 degrees F vs. 350 degrees F) cover the bird tightly with foil to keep the water pressure as high as possible, and check the internal temp earlier than recommended (i.e. 2 hours for a 15 pound bird instead of recommended 2.5 hours).   Remember, being able to see water boil at 200 degrees F, instead of 212 degrees F does not mean the temperature of 200 degrees F is more effective at killing pathogens. The time to kill the pathogens will just need to be extended at 200 degrees F. \"The lower the temp, the longer it takes to kill.\"   Hope this helps!  Stephanie  sbianco-simeral@csuchico.edu",

        "response":"Dear Lillian,Thank you for your interest in helmet safety. I was interested to read you story and glad that you are recovering. While our team of experts focuses more specifically on equine research and not medical research, we are dedicated to promoting all aspects of riding and helmet safety. It appears from the literature that USPA allows players to make the choice on whether or not to wear helmets that meet certain safety standards. USPA does encourage polo players to wear protective headgear that meets NOCSAE standards, but they do not endorse a specific brand or manufacturer. The research testing polo helmets indicates the \"argentine Style\" does not offer the same level of protection as helmets that meet NOCSAE standards. With that said, it also appears the USPA requires players to sign a waiver if they chose not to wear a helmet that meets NOCSAE standards.This information was found on the \"Riders4Helmets\" website I have copied below. They also include a figure on the testing that was performed to assess the shock absorbency and head injury risks of two different polo helmets and reported by Casablanca Polo (manufacturer of Casablanca 6 helmet that meets NOCSAE standards). http:\/\/www.riders4helmets.com\/2012\/02\/helmets-in-polo-the-nocsae-standard\/There is also evidence that there are different types of head injuries depending on the type of equestrian sport. ASTM-SEI helmet designed for general riding, may not meet the safety standards required for other sports such as polo, rodeo events or harness racing.

Otherwise it quickly becomes a pain and not worth your time.Also, only a few varieties have been bread to do well on the short trellis.

        "response":"Worms aren't needed for plant growth. Worms are one of many species (most of them microscopic) in soil that can provide benefits for plants. Worms are involved in the cycling of nutrients to plant available forms. They also tunnel pathways that can be used by water, air and root growth. An exact number of worms that be ideal for making soil the most hospitible for plants is hard to say.A more practical way of looking at it is creating an environment that is inviting to worms. Organic matter in soil is an important food source that will attract worms and other benficial soil organisms. Ideally a garden soil should have 5% or more organic matter, but that sn't always easy to achieve depending on the loca conditions. Organic matter must be reguarly maintained to keep soil organisms happy.The other bit about worms in your soil is that you want to till as little as possible. Would you want to live in a neighborhood that is getting destroyed regularly? Tilling to worms is like a catostrophic earthquake to humans.",

    "title-question":"This insect lived in our bathroom (shower) window for more than four months. We gave it ample opportunities to leave, but it never did. It stayed in the same general area - a small corner, but moved around, and seemed to benefit from our shower steam. It had plenty of natural light during the day from the window. We could not figure out what it was eating, but guessed it was something very tiny available around the drafty window. When we went out of town for 10 days, we left a small bowl of water, but do not know if it used the water. FURTHER DESCRIPTION: This insect had no wings. It had a skinny \"neck\" and barely distinguishable head, and antennae that arched up and over gracefully, almost like a cartoon character of a bug. There was nothing threatening-looking (mouth, stinger, etc.). It had 6 legs. Its back was stiff and brown, and its underbelly was bright green. DETAIL: Under the hard layer of its brown back, there were shapes that looked like two sunflower seeds under the surface - as if you were to place two sunflower seeds about 2 millimeters apart with their points facing. You may be able to see this in the full-body photo. This bug had quite a personality, as it would rest dormant most of the time, but when we entered the bathroom for a shower, it would \"perk up,\" move around, and even position itself to peer around the corner and look at us. NOTE: We tried to identify this insect on our own. We have not been able to find an exact match, nor has either of us ever seen (or notice) an example of it in the past.

        "response":"Most likely, in the SF Bay Area, you are dealing with Argentine ants. They often come indoors when conditions outside become adverse. We just had a heavy rain event this past weekend; they may have moved in to avoid flooding of their colony and drowning. The problem may be worse if they were able to find uncontained resources such as food (sweets and proteins) and water. This issue is best dealt with by: following the ant trail to discover the structural avenue by which they gained access to your home sealing up the structural gap(s) with caulk, sealant, door sweeps, screens, etc. Should the problem continue after structural exclusion efforts (will benefit energy efficiency as well), you can wipe up ants and erase their trails with soapy water. If all else fails, bait stations (with an attractant mixed with a slow-acting toxin such as borate or fipronil) will reduce the ant density and maybe even destroy the colony. The nest is outside; you may direct efforts there, but realize ants are important predators and scavengers outdoors (beneficial insects).

        "response":"First, be sure you select tree varieties that are suitable to your growing conditions. Your local extension office should be able to help you decide which may do best. Find contact information athttp:\/\/ucanr.edu\/County_Offices\/Clay soil includes a range from silty clay to something akin toconcrete. I will assume yours is tillable to the extent youcan get a spade into it todig holes. The proper way to plant a tree is to dig a holeso that the top of theroot ball sits about 3 incheshigher in the hole than it did in the pot. Do not till the bottom of the hole since this can cause settling and sinking later. Digthe hole about2 to 3 times as wide as the root ball, makingsure the sides of the hole are rough, not smooth.Fill the hole half full of water and observe how long it takes to drain out. If it does not drain within 2 hours, you have a serious drainage problem. This may not be the right place to plant a tree.Consult a certified arborist or speak with your extension agentbefore plantingIf the water drains awayin that time, procede with planting. Gently loosen the root ball so there are no roots winding around it. You can mix a handful of well-rotted compost in with the original soil, but no more. Fill the hole with the original soil, tamping gently andmaking sure the surfaceslopesslightlyaway from the tree trunk. Water the soil slowly but deeply, beingcareful not to allow the water to pool or compact the soil. A drip hose used overnight is best.Now you can add an inch or so ofcompost on the top of the soil. Extend it out beyond the size of the hole, but keepit away from the tree trunk.Finally, cover the entire root area with 2 to 3 inches of mulch to maintain soil moisture, again keeping it several inches away from the trunk.If there is no rain, water the tree slowly anddeeply once or twice a week, again using a drip hose or slow sprinkler over several hours.Clay can be full of nutrients, but it lacks air spaces which allow roots to thrive. Apply an inch ofmature compost to the entire root area once or twice a year, extending it out beyond the drip line of the tree. Over a few years. the clay should improve in texture, and your tree will probably thank you.Cheers,",

        "response":"Hello, There are a couple things you can look into to help you make your land purchase decisions. The first determination would be whether the property is in an agriculturally zoned area. If so, then the land owner can have any number of agricultural ventures taking place on the property. I would assume it is, since you mentioned buying a ranch next door, but your county planning &amp; zoning board would be able to tell you how the land is classified and what agricultural ventures are permitted to be conducted on the property. The county would also know whether or not the composting operation needs to be permitted. There are established setback recommendations for manure storage facilities that are used as minimum recommendations. These may change depending on how close the water table is to the surface, type of topography in your region, etc. Some general recommendations are 100-200 feet from established wells or potable water, 200-500 feet from residences or places of business, and 50-100 feet of property lines. If the county says he is within his rights and he seems to be honoring the setback recommendations there isn't much else you can do. If he is honoring the setback recommendations your water source should be sound, but you can always have the well tested to ensure the drinking water is indeed safe. I would consider seriously whether or not to purchase the adjoining property. If the potential neighbors land is a nuisance to you now, it will undoubtedly be more problematic once you share a property line. Good luck!",

        "response":"In Southern California the predominant ant pest is Argentine ant. I can't verify that this is your problem, but a pest management professional oryour county Extension office should be able to help. Assuming Argentine ant, you are dealing with a pest that isvery prolific and needs ongoing control, usually with a liquid sugar-based bait. Baiting in combination with sprays applied to the outside perimeter of the home are usually effective. You need to find a pest control company that can positively identify the ant and design a control program that will meet this pest head-on. Look for companies that have a certified entomologist (ACE or BCE) on staff. The treatments you mention would not be expected to have any effect on these ants. Over the counter sugar baits are usually not sold in the volumes needed to bring an Argentine ant problem under control.",

Both the male and female bees are shaped like large bumble bees with dusky wings. The female is a solid, metallic-reflections black color with little hair on the top of the abdomen. The male also is quite large and is covered with buff hair over the whole body. Male carpenter bees have a tendency to be territorial, and they will \"buzz\" any intruder that they find in their space. Being male, they are harmless. The females have a painful sting and a very strong bite, since they bore tunnels in wood to make their dwellings.",

Just move the camera to six to eight inches away from the spider and take the picture. DON'T use the zoom as this will throw off the macro settings and the image will be really fuzzy!

    "title-question":"I am in the Los Angeles area.  I planted 8 varieties of chilis\/peppers outside 4 days ago as starts, approximately 4-6\" tall (Serrano, Cow Horn, Poblano, 2 lg Bell-types and some mini-sweet peppers).  I tend to get a lot of snails so the evening of the second day I sprinkled snail bait &amp; poison around the plants though at that point there had been no damage that I could see.  The next morning I went out and 4 of the plants had been almost completely denuded (though the crowns were undamaged) and the other 4 had received some eating damage.  Additionally a couple of tomatillo and tomato starts had some minor bites.  There was no evidence of snails or slugs and there was no scraps of leaves around the plants.  I decided I would go out in the evening to see if I could see any critters about, however I went out late in the afternoon to do some unrelated work and noticed that the 4 remaining peppers had received significant more damage since the morning.  I sprayed the plants with soapy water and this morning there didn't seem to be additional damage.  I wasn't home most of today and when I got home in the early evening I went out to spray the plants again and all my peppers leaves have now been eaten to the stalks.  There are gophers in the area but there are no holes near my garden and there are no tracks or feces.  There are a LOT of lizards in the area (my apologies but I don't know species or types--grey, no significant markings, large ones are about 6\" long) but I thought lizards were carniverous, not herbivorous.  But the lizards are the only evidence of critters that I can see.  I didn't have this problem last year--I only had snails and slugs--but there were a lot of lizards last year though there are more this year.  Could it be the lizards?  If so, what can I do to prevent this from happening again? Monday morning update: No additional damage during the night. I have a lot of glass vases so I covered all the peppers with them this morning and will check them this afternoon for more critter damage since most of the damageseems to be happening during the day--it's overcast and cool so I don't anticipate heat damage",

    "question":"I am in the Los Angeles area.  I planted 8 varieties of chilis\/peppers outside 4 days ago as starts, approximately 4-6\" tall (Serrano, Cow Horn, Poblano, 2 lg Bell-types and some mini-sweet peppers).  I tend to get a lot of snails so the evening of the second day I sprinkled snail bait &amp; poison around the plants though at that point there had been no damage that I could see.  The next morning I went out and 4 of the plants had been almost completely denuded (though the crowns were undamaged) and the other 4 had received some eating damage.  Additionally a couple of tomatillo and tomato starts had some minor bites.  There was no evidence of snails or slugs and there was no scraps of leaves around the plants.  I decided I would go out in the evening to see if I could see any critters about, however I went out late in the afternoon to do some unrelated work and noticed that the 4 remaining peppers had received significant more damage since the morning.  I sprayed the plants with soapy water and this morning there didn't seem to be additional damage.  I wasn't home most of today and when I got home in the early evening I went out to spray the plants again and all my peppers leaves have now been eaten to the stalks.  There are gophers in the area but there are no holes near my garden and there are no tracks or feces.  There are a LOT of lizards in the area (my apologies but I don't know species or types--grey, no significant markings, large ones are about 6\" long) but I thought lizards were carniverous, not herbivorous.  But the lizards are the only evidence of critters that I can see.  I didn't have this problem last year--I only had snails and slugs--but there were a lot of lizards last year though there are more this year.  Could it be the lizards?  If so, what can I do to prevent this from happening again? \u00c2Monday morning update: No additional damage during the night. I have a lot of glass vases so I covered all the peppers with them this morning and will check them this afternoon for more critter damage since most of the damage\u00c2seems to be happening during the day--it's overcast and cool so I don't anticipate heat damage",

        "response":"The damage that you are observing is more than likely mice. In our campus greenhouses, this is a continuing problem. My solution has been to build a small frame with 1\/4 inch wire mesh. That way the seeds can germinate and get up to the first true leaf, which then is less attractive of a grazing point for your rodents. You might also try tangle foot around your plantings, but I find the screen to be adequate.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Wow! You have really gotten into these unusual organisms! Slime molds used to be thought to be a kind of primitive fungus, but modern genetic analysis of them puts them much closer to amoeboid protozoa. In this case, they act like colonial amoeba that have unusual habits of reproduction through complex spore-forming structures. The Wikipedia web site on slime molds is pretty good and if you look at the references, you can find some of the traditional publications as well as some more modern references.In answer to your questions, slime molds are very adapted to survive environmental extremes of heat and cold, dry conditions and wet conditions. They are generally most active during cool and wet seasons when they adopt the amoeboid state, moving around in mass, feeding on decaying organic matter. When conditions become less than favorable, they may simply dry down in a mumified state, or sporulate so that the very resistant spores survive until the next favorable period.",

      {
        "response":"I forgot to mention that when the slime molds decide it's time to sporulate, they often go considerable distances from where their food was located. A common one in turfgrass apparently eats the thatch and other decaying matter, then creeps up the grass stems, to the blades where they cover them with tiny round gray balls (spore masses). My favorite species is Stemonitus which forms spore masses that look like neat rows of tiny trees. My least favorite is the one that is commonly called \"dog barf fungus!\" This usually forms a orange to brown spore mass on the surface of mulch that has been kept too wet. It really looks like its common name!",

    "title-question":"As a former Minnesota resident and U of M grad I am turning to you in desperation.  It seems like all of the tree advice sites on Google are in Great Britain.  My neighbor has a large camphor tree within 6 feet of our house.  The roots extend under our sidewalk, which they have been lifting for some time, and now are starting to cause a major crack in the stucco on our house.  The neighbor would prefer not to cut down the tree.  Her tree trimmer has told her that the root would keep growing even if the tree is removed and that the best way to deal with the problem is to remove the existing brick walk, excavate deep enough to pour a concrete reinforced with rebar barrier, and replace the brick walk.  Seems to me like an expensive and questionable solution that doesn't solve the cracking wall unless he excavates under it as well. So I would prefer to remove the tree but not if the root continues to grow.  Is it true that the root will continue to live and grow after the tree is removed?",

Since these insects usually don't occur very far from sleeping areas it is unlikely that bed bugs would be found in the attic (unless someone is sleeping there). Mysterious rashes have many causes other than insect bites. In fact food and respiratory allergies are the most common causes but even stress can cause rash\/hives. Discuss these possibilities with your health care provider. Finally, if bed bugs are the real cause here are some suggestions for bed bug control (this is my personal website, your county Extension office may have additional information).",

Usually considered a short-lived perennial in Zones 3-8, but may live for several years if stalks are cut off at their bases after the flowers fade. Planting hollyhock may be done in spring or fall. Select a sunny location sheltered from the wind. Try to have the soil worked up at least one week before planting time. Spring plantings will be safer in areas where winters are severe. Keep the roots moist until you are able to plant. Firm the soil around the plants and roots by pressing the soil with your hands. Water well to eliminate air pockets that may form around the roots.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Great question! In short - the definition of \"beef\" in the U.S. is very specific. The 88% beef is the same as a steak, except steaks are a type of beef cut that is tender. Ground beef is made from less tender parts of a bovine. Still muscle as a steak is, but from areas that get lots of work and so are not tender by themselves. That is why we grind them. We copy some official words taken from the USDA on this topic below:  From what cuts of beef are ground beef and hamburger made?    Generally, ground beef is made from the less tender and less popular cuts of beef. Trimmings from more tender cuts may also be used. Grinding tenderizes the meat and the fat reduces its dryness and improves flavor.    Questions about \"ground meat\" or \"hamburger\" have always been in the top five food topics of calls to the USDA's Meat and Poultry Hotline. Here are the most frequently asked questions and information about why ground beef requires careful handling.    What's the difference between \"hamburger\" and \"ground beef\"?  Beef fat may be added to \"hamburger,\" but not \"ground beef.\" A maximum of 30% fat is allowed in either hamburger or ground beef. Both hamburger and ground beef can have seasonings, but no water, phosphates, extenders, or binders added. The labeling of meat food products must comply with the Federal Meat Inspection Act (FMIA) and the meat inspection regulations and labeling policies.    Most states and cities set standards for store-packaged ground beef which, by law, cannot be less than Federal standards. If products in retail stores were found to contain more than 30% fat, they would be considered \"misbranded\" under Federal law.    Is ground beef inspected and graded?  All meat transported and sold in interstate commerce must be federally inspected. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) carries out USDA's responsibilities under the Federal Meat Inspection Act. These laws protect consumers by ensuring that meat products are wholesome, unadulterated, and correctly labeled and packaged.    Many states have their own inspection programs that are applicable for meats produced and sold within their borders only. State inspection programs must enforce requirements at least equal to those of Federal inspection laws.    Ground beef exported to the U.S. from USDA-approved eligible nations must meet all safety standards applied to foods produced in the United States. They must employ equivalent sanitary measures that provide the same level of protection against food hazards as is achieved domestically.    Grades are assigned as a standard of quality only. It is voluntary for a company to hire a Federal Grader to certify the quality of its product. Beef grades are USDA Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter, and Canner. They are set by the USDA Agricultural Marketing Service. Most ground beef is not graded.",

You candirect your question to the Master Gardeners or to the Environmental Horticulture program leaders.http:\/\/ceorange.ucanr.edu\/ Having to work this hard to get the clods to break up is probably indicative of a heavy soil that could use either better drainage, or more probably,the addition of lots of compost, leaf mulch, manure, or other organic matter.Yes, the clods might eventually break down in the rain.Sometimes we call those clods, soil \"peds\" .Generally the finer and smaller the seed, the more your soil \"peds\" need to be broken down. Newly plantedseed needs to be in contact with the soil in such a way that it will not dry out. The larger the soil clods, the larger the air spaces are between the clods and the less likely your seed is to remain covered and moist while it germinates. Another problem with those larger clods is that as new roots develop and push down through the soil, if they encounter blockage of a dry soil clod or a rock, they will be stunted and perhaps even die if they cannot stay in contact with moist soil. Carrots are infamous for splitting and twisting in heavy soil.Two inches is even too big for the germination of small seed. Adding organic matter to the soil will help to loosen the soil for better workability. ",

I bought it for the flowers and the beautiful fragrance. What can I do to insure I get the flowers next year",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Well, you did right in selecting a plant that was in bloom. You at least know what you're getting. The most common problem with wisteria not blooming is late spring frosts or cold weather. But my guess that in Ventura county that hasn't been your situation. The second most common problem is improper pruning. Wisteria bloom on the previous years growth. So the strategy is to select a few canes to serve as the main frame of the plant. It will need something to grow on and, once established, won't give up that frame. So select your structure carefully. Here in Oregon we prune our wisterias in the fall, after the flowers are spent. We train the leaders we want to be the scaffolds, and cut the spurs back to about 4 to 6 leaves. This is where the new buds will develop. The rest we cut away. I don't know what variety you have but this is a large plant! You can get some nice flowers for a few years, but eventually it will become root bound in that pot and stop flowering again. Is there not a good spot for this plant in your garden? Perhaps somewhere close to the house where you can smell it! Your Ventura County Extension agent will have information on how to prune, and maybe a schedule of classes too.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for using eXtension. If the flower is the injury my best guess that it is Thirps. They are very small plant feeders. the can completely destroy the flower. Thrips may prevent the gladioli flowers from opening and distorting the blooms that do open. The leaves of the plants are streaked with white areas. A very tiny insect, the gladiolus thrip is responsible for this damage. The insect overwinters in the gladiolus corm and sucks sap from the plant during the growing season. This sucking of the sap causes the white streaking on the plant leaves. Their feeding also causes deformed blossoms. The thrip is about 1\/16 of an inch in length and brown in color.The gladiolus thrip can be controlled in the growing plant as well as in the harvested corm. To protect the plants, spray or dust the gladiolus when they reach 6 inches in height and continuing treatment every 7 to 10 days until flowering.Other insecticides labeled for thrips such  as Tempo can also be used, but only for plants listed on the label. The active ingredient in Tempo is available in Bayer Advanced Garden  Multi-Insect Killer. When using insecticide, mix and apply according to  label directions. After harvesting and curing the gladiolus corms, shake them in a sack with a small amount of 5% Sevin dust (1 - 2 teaspoons for each 100 corms) and store as usual. This procedure will control the thrips in the over wintering corms.Let me know if you have any other questions. Jackiejackie.buckley@ndsu.edu",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Good Morning,If the previous tree to grow in the area was infected with a wood-rotting fungus there are probably still living spores and fungal structures on the site. Provided you purchase a newly dughealthy young tree the likelihood of immediate re-infestation is probably low. However, there are a few things to check on before planting.Before planting your new tree, investigate the site to insure that the previous root crown and roots have decayed and that there are no wood chips embedded in the soil. Stump grinding leaves behind a mix of chips and soil that will absorb and keep absorbing nitrogen from the site. They can also affect soil pH. Be sure the chippings and any large pieces of wood are out of the planting area.Once you have planted your new tree, maintain it well. Insure it has adequate water, mulch, and that you handle all aspects of planting carefully. The less injury the tree suffers during planting the better. You want quick, healthy establishment to insure your tree grows vigorously.The above advice is based on your question as asked. The specific type of fungal agent in the previous modesto ash can affect my recommendations. I strongly suggest contacting your local California Extension office:http:\/\/celosangeles.ucanr.edu\/",

Some folks will use pieces of clear tape---the type used to make packages for mailing. Make an appointment with your physician\/dermatologist. Either make a list of all medications you are taking now or collect the bottles and packaging into a bag you can take with you to the appointment. Be sure toinclude anything botanical\/herbal and'over-the-counter' productson the list or in the bag.Make a list of all personal use products that you spray, rinseor rub onto your body---lotions, eye drops, hair coloring, perfumes, shaving products, what have you.Now check your laundry products, listing your laundry detergents (scented or not), fabric softener liquids or sheets. Anything else you might apply to your laundry---things you use frequently as well as products used for items in storage.How about household cleaners\/cleansers? Bleach? Lysol? Other products that you spray or contact in some way?Are you currently applying pesticides for some pest? Weeds? Insects? Rodents? List the products and theiractive ingredients. Some of these will certainly make you itch.Be prepared to discuss\/ask questions about your general health to this point. Other than itchiness, what else have you noticed? Do your symptoms warrant further tests and diagnosis?What evidence of bites can you show? When does this sensation occur? Are you indoors or outdoors or both when it occurs?Your physician\/dermatologist should be able to submit specimens of mites or whatever you can find to your county Extension office or to your local Department of Healthfor identification.Before getting too excited about spraying something and only adding to your misery, find out what the cause(s) are of these sensations. Tests for allergic reactions or simple adjustments in medications you take may make all the difference in the world.I hope this makes sense. In my 30+ years of making identifications and recommendations, 'biting mites' have never turned out to be the cause of these most unpleasant situations. Results come faster and cheaper by going the medical route.Good luck.",

The  sweet potato will sprout and you remove each of these slips (shoots) with a bit  of a twisting motion to pull it away from the main root. Pot  each slip (shoot) up as you remove it from the mother plant and keep it very  warm until new leaves and shoots develop. Leave the mother plant in  place to continue producing baby shoots.

This will necessitate removing treated animals from the organic herd. Regardless, animal welfare and organic standards require treatment of sick or injured animals even in organic herds.

Most of what you read concerns the above ground parts being poisonous, even dried plant parts. There's not much in the literature regarding roots (although much literature says 'all plant parts' are poisonous...when they elaborate, they never mention roots).Here's my take: a newly planted fruit tree should not be allowed to bear until year 3. By that time, I would hope that most of the roots would be decayed or certainly in the process. By that time, it would be hard to guess how much of the toxin is present or where it is. According to http:\/\/www.inchem.org\/documents\/pims\/plant\/pim366.htm#SubSectionTitle:3.3.2%20%20Description,%20chem..., the toxin is insoluble in water. Therefore, not much of it (if any) would enter the roots of another plant growing nearby.I would plant the fruit trees and enjoy the fruit in year 3. Hope this is helpful.",

I love to plant a cover crop in between plantings (I use a mixture of oats, vetch, fava, and pea) and then till it in a few inches after it gets about 3 feet tall, wait a few weeks, and then plant my next season's veggie crop. However, this year i am not planting veggies or anything else for two reasons : one, we are in a drought situation here in SoCal (Santa Barbara), and two, this passionate but part time farmer needs a physical and mental rest from gardening in order to focus on other home projects. My understanding of cover cropping is that you need to plant fairly soon after tillage, if not, the earth soon looses its biological activity (from havingused up thelarge shot of organic greens it just received) and reverts to not-so-good soil as that green matter gets turned into composte by the microbes etc. My question is, is this correct? Do I need to plant something in the soil in order to keep it active and ready to plant in later in the year(to maintain its biological viability)? Second question ... can i put in a second cover crop (or a third, etc)? Third question, how does letting the soil go \"fallow\" fit in to this scenario ? I've always heard that its good to let soil go fallow (unplanted) for a season now and again, but if the biological activity stops after a few weeks (as the cover crop deteriorates and disappears), then how is this helpful ?

    "title-question":"Uninformed\/Unpracticed? Greetings:  1 July 2014  I was surprised with the lack of scholarly and\/or incorrect\/uninformed? information present in your brief informational concerning pickles and\/pickling. Beyond this, I feel that anyone following the advice presented in your website will likely be at the receiving end of a rather ghastly batch of pickles.  For one, Japanese varieties of cucumbers (burpless) provide excellent results using traditional lacto-fermentation processes. Japanese varieties such as Sooyow Nishiki, Suhyo Cross hybrid and Tsuyataro hybrid possess perfect anatomies for crafting world-class pickles. They have proper skin thickness and diameter for successful pickling.  Secondly, when preparing pickles through traditional aerobic methods it is unnecessary (as it is undesirable) to subject the pickles to high temperature or high acid concentrations (as in the addition of vinegar). The potential of botulism is virtually non-existent for the aerobic lacto-fermentation process.  For best results:   Cool cucumbers as soon as they are harvested.  Introduce the chilled cucumbers and all pickling components (e.g. dill, garlic, pickling spices etc.) to a chilled salt brine of ~3.5% w\/w.  Uniformly arrange a number of young blackberry leaves in the brine-filled pickling vessel (a loose-packed handful per half-gallon container is sufficient) to maintain crispness of the pickled product. Blackberry leaves contain tannins, a class of substances that have been positively correlated with crisp pickles, both in the literature and in my personal practice.  At around 25 degrees Celsius, cucumbers processed in this manner with be ready to be placed in the refrigerator within 2.33-2.66 days where from, in my experience, the pickles are quickly consumed.  During the fermentation process, the pickles should be covered with a clean clothe or paper towel that is affixed to the vessel's mouth with a rubber band.

        "response":"California has rules which may supersede what I am about to write from out of state. Please check with your ag dealer to be sure about any restrictions and local rules if you decide to use chemical controls. OK, disclaimer out of the way. Cattails can only be controlled physically or chemically. No \"bugs\" will eat them away for you. That is, there is no biological control that is effective that I am aware of. You can pull up small infestations of cattail by hand\/shovel. If the patch is a large patch, then glyphosate labeled for ponds is the best choice.If you want an organic control, herbicidal vinegars can be applied but will take many applications to weaken the plants sufficiently to kill them. Vinegars do not kill the roots until the plant is weakened and the root \"starves\". Glyphosateis very effective if applied at labeled rates with a surfactant\/wetting agent later in the season justbefore the heads mature. This timing gets a lot of product to move down to the roots. The glyphosate will also kill almost any other surrounding green plant material it is sprayed on, so be careful.The pond formulations are usually only sold in ag dealers or ag cooperatives. You will not find them at box stores or most local garden centers. The ag dealer will be able to help you with figuring spray rates and helping get the right surfactant in the mix if that is needed.",

        "response":"Thanks for using Ask-An-Expert for assistance with your tree question. Without physically seeing this tree, it is hard to provide an accurate diagnosis, but it sounds like this specimen has internal decay which has now become exposed through the bark - possibly near the root collar. The soft, moist tissue is providing a favorable environment for underground hornets - these can be very aggressive, so be careful! I would suggest you contact your local University of California Cooperative Extension office and ask for an 'on-site' visit. Through their guidance, and pending the health condition of the tree, you may be able to exterminate the hornet nest without harming the tree. Hornets are most active during warm weather and daylight hours - but you don't want to provoke their anger anytime. An Entomologist from the University or your local state\/county forestry service may also be able to provide assistance.

      {
        "response":"Hello Gardener,I'm in Alabama, but this sounds familiar to many gardeners in any location.While we all love a fresh tomato, they are one of the most persnickety of all veggies to grow. They need consistent soil moisture (not too wet, and never dry) - cool soil (mulch is a must) - air temp's between 60F-90F (each variety varies in preference though) - steady nutrition - soil calcium - soil pH between 6.0-7.0 - and patience.When tomatoes fail to set fruit, I normally suspect stress either from moisture (too much or not enough), temperature (nights too cool\/too hot,or days too hot), or excess nitrogen. Noticing your location, I'll suspect the cool nights are causing the flowers to drop. They do this anytime an environmental stress causes the pollen to fail. Dead pollen then makes the flower drop off the plant.Once the temperatures are a little warmer, you plants should set fruit as expected.I hope this information was helpful. Happy gardening.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Tobacco Mosaic Virus of Tomato    Unlike fungicidal chemicals used to control fungal diseases, to date there are no efficient chemical treatments that protect plant parts from virus infection.    The virus enters plants through wounds sustained in transplanting or pruning. It spreads rapidly once it is in the host. Tobacco products are the most common source of inoculum; smokers can infect plants by handling them. The virus is not spread by aphids.   Additionally, there are no known chemical treatments used under field conditions that eliminate viral infections from plant tissues once they do occur. Practically speaking, plants infected by viruses remain so. Thus, control of tobacco mosaic virus is primarily focused on reducing and eliminating sources of the virus and limiting the spread by insects. Tobacco mosaic virus is the most persistent plant virus known. It has been known to survive up to 50 years in infected seeds, plant debris, and even clothing. Also, it is extremely tolerant of very high temperatures. Therefore, sanitation is the single most important practice in controlling tobacco mosaic virus.    Organic Pest Management Strategies   1. Remove and destroy infected plants. Pull plants with mosaic symptoms immediately. Remove the debris from the garden area and bury them if possible.   2. Keep your garden weed-free. Use an appropriate organic herbicide on weeds or remove weeds by hand.   3. Always wash your hands thoroughly and disinfect tools. Before handling plants, wash with soap and water, especially if you're a smoker.   4. Plant resistant varieties of tomato. Suggested varieties include: Big Pick, Celebrity, President, and Park's Extra Early Hybrid. Other resistant varieties will be labeled TMV resistant.",

        "response":"Hello,It is difficult to diagnose the cause from your description. I suggest that you look at the PNW Insect Management Handbook and the PNW Disease Management Handbook under snap beans. I can't think of any insects or diseases that cause green bumps on snap beans. If they are relatively large swellings, it could be the developing seed inside the pod, but I expect you would have recognized that. Perhaps it is some sort of physiological condition related to weather or some other factor. Perhaps it is a varietal trait. I suggest tasting the beans, and expect they would be fine to eat if they look appetizing. If this is an important issue on your farm or garden, you may want to send samples to the UC Davis Plant Disease Clinic: http:\/\/pdc.ucdavis.edu\/. I am based in Oregon and don't use that clinic, so would suggest looking at their website or contacting them before sending a sample. Try looking for a causative organism like an insect or disease. And don't get discouraged, plant problem diagnosis can be tricky and very humbling.I hope this gets you started.",

You look to have a severe case, not sure if fungicides at this point will even help.  Preventative sprays are the most important for this disease.

        "response":"Hello,I'm based in Oregon and work with small farms rather than gardens, so I'm not quite sure why I got your question. Up here we often prune and tip tomatoes to slow down vegetative growth about this time of year and encourage more fruiting. That helps us get more fruit before the end of the growing season. In your area the best technique would depend on the length of your growing season and the variety (i.e. determinate vs. indeterminate). I would recommend you refer to this UC publication and get an opinion from the advisors at your local Master Gardener location - I think their experience would be more relevant than mine.http:\/\/ucanr.org\/repository\/fileaccess.cfm?article=54222&amp;p=%20ZKXKHX You might also consider larger trellising systems. With your long growing season, I expect you could ripen a lot of fruit on a relatively large plant.Good luck - it sounds like a lot of things are going well with your plants!",

If the symptomaticfruit are facing high afternoon sun, then sunscald is probably what is going on.  If the symptoms are on well shaded fruit, too, then I am likely not correct.

Looks like bower is from old English, \"room, hut, dwelling, chamber'.

Jumping spiders have good eyesight.  They have the unnerving habit of turning to look at you when you apprioach, but they are not dangerous. They are active hunters that chase and \"jump\" on their prey.  They do not build webs.

I have a well that I drilled over 4 years ago for irrigation. I have planted over 100 trees and shrubs here for wind breaks and shade, plus some fruit trees. We have between 1-4 inches of rain for the whole year if we are lucky and windy.My problem is that by July and August my Siouxland and Mojave Poplars start yellowing and show scorched leaves which eventually drop. I water them every three days approx. 15-25 gallons each in a bermed area that is as wide as the drip line. Some trees show new growth while having the leaf problems. I have had my water tested for drinking uses and I am wondering If my SAR levels are to high, sodium or chloride also. I am at 83 mg\/l for sodium, 5.2mg\/l for calcium, .49mg\/l for Mag. Chloride 5.7 mg\/l. My PH is around 7.5 -7-8. TDS 200ppm. I have tried Gypsum in the past and it seemed to help a little. Also tried Ironite thinking its Chlorosis.

My trees were established 2-3 years ahead of his but his have outgrown mine. Are my trees underwatered or am I overwatering them? I have the same leaf and twig die back in Euonymus shrubs, Red tip Photina and potted vegetables. Could this be a salt build up due to high evaporation? So many questions I have. My Afgan Pines and Italian Cypress do not seem affected. I have also tried an inline Sodium reducing filter to combat any excess salts. The cartridge seems to get restricted quickly. I am also watering out of a storage tank after the well. Maybe salt buildup on bottom of tank ? In previous years where we had more rain during the winter I did not see this as bad.

My Afgan Pines and Italian Cypress do not seem affected. I have also tried an inline Sodium reducing filter to combat any excess salts. The cartridge seems to get restricted quickly. I am also watering out of a storage tank after the well. Maybe salt buildup on bottom of tank ? In previous years where we had more rain during the winter I did not see this as bad. Please share your insight",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"These symptoms could be water or salt stress, it is basically the same thing.  You may not be irrigating enough.  Irrigation does two things, water the tress and washes excess salts out.  Your water is not that high in total salts (200 mg\/l) but with time even a little salt can accumulate to a lot...  I would prefer you increase your irrigation per setting rather than increase the number of days you are watering.  This is generally more healthy for your trees and will allow your soil to stay free of salts.  Do you know how deeply you are irrigating into your soil when you apply water.  Check with a shovel, you should be going down at least a couple of feet.  If your water is ponding a gypsum application may be in order as this will help keep the sodium out of the profile and allow water to penetrate better.  Gypsum may need to be applied sever times during the year.My suggestion is to up your irrigation rate and lets see what happensdon.",

You will want to loosen the roots up and replant in the next size container (ie from 6\" to 8\" or 8\" to a 10\" pot)  Don't transplant when in flower or when you have lots of new growth or you will probably lose both.  If you have some new growth you might want to place it in filtered sunlight for a few weeks to allow it to regrow new roots.  Typically citrus will bloom in the fall of the year but you can get blooms at different times of the year.   You can encourage blooming with a higher phosphorous fertilizer (ie 0-20-0)  For more information you can contact your Extension office at:  80 Stone Pine Road, Suite 100  Half Moon Bay, CA 94019  650-726-9059  cesanmateo@ucdavis.edu",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi Bill,Unfortunately, the pruning solution would not work. When a plant is pruned or a branch\/leaves are removed by nature, the plant will respond to that injury and try to put on new growth and in some cases more than what was originally removed. In drought conditions one of the best ways to conserve water is to help the plant not loose as much moisture to the environment by adjusting how water is applied and adding cool mulches around the root system.Depending on the type of plant, most trees and shrubs have shallow wide spreading root systems. If you can make a point to water to at least a 1 foot depth and water as wide or wider than the drip-line of the plant, this will encourage deeper and wider spreading roots. Most plants will maintain roots in the top 18\" of soil if water and oxygen are present. If you then fill these basins with bark, compost, or other cool mulches the soil temperature will stay cooler in the summer and reduce the amount of moisture lost to the air. These mulches will also feed the soil as microbes will eat on the organic matter and help feed the plants at slow and manageable natural rate.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"To best protect the trees it would be advisable to build barrier boxes around the trees to prevent the sand from acculturating around the trunk. Since the trees are newly planted the addition of sand around the area where the root-system will eventually grow is not as critical, but the possibility of sand piling up on the trunk and possibly going over the grafting point is. If sand or soil cover the grafting point this could kill the tree. The grafting point is generally a large bulging area about 3-4\" above the soil line, but this can vary depending on the tree grower.If you simply construct a redwood or Douglas fir box around the trees this will keep the sand out and your dip-system in place. The size of the box area is up to you, but the bigger the better. Eventually you will need to water a larger area as the trees get older. In the beginning the watering area should spread out to at least twice what the roots system was in the pot. It would also be a good idea to place a couple of inches of good quality compost in the planting box area. This will help keep your soil moisture more consistent and feed the soil which will in-turn feed the tree.",

You could also place the seeds or seedhead in a cardboard box in a cool dark place. DO NOT place the seeds in any airtight container. After several weeks, the seeds will be a uniform brownish color.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I'd say it depends upon how much of the plant is damaged. If not that much is damaged, you can get away with trimmin off damaged leaves - the plan uses photosynthetic products to store up energy which it will use over the winter and in the spring for recrudescence - so the more leaves it can retain, the ahppier it will be , however if the leaves are extensively damaged, the plant will spend energy to attempt repairs and they should be removed - its a judgement call based on the extend of damage - without pictures, it would have to be your call as to whether the leaves are doing mor harm than good at this point.

    "title":"Summer Sores.",
    "title-question":"Summer Sores. I've been battling a horrible case of summer sores for over 2 months with my poor gelding. He's the only horse out of 17 at his stables that has been inflicted. They started on the corner of his mouth - 2 months, $3,000 and massive treatments late they are worse than when this all started and seem to be spreading both in size and in locations.. They started in the corner of his mouth and now has them on his nose and a nasty case just popped up inside his sheath. He is miserable, the only way to clean and treat them is to drug him (he's been drugged nearly every day for 2 months!). He has been treated with silver nitrate, antibiotics, scarlet oil, ivermectin (orally and externally), wonder dust, peroxide, and is on his third vet trying to get these things under control. The poor guy is miserable and after 2 months and he is worse than ever. Any alternative ideas out there? Yesterday we moved him into a completely screened in 12x12 stall - his attitude about that is not at all positive - he's used to living outside and being around other horses - now he cannot even see his buddies because we have him fully enclosed to try to control the fly population. I'm afraid he's just going to get injured thrashing around and kicking because he is so unhappy in this stall. I've never seen anything like this and hope I never do again. I'd really like to hear if anyone has had any success with treatments and if so which ones. His mouth looks like hamburger :(. Also interested in how once you were able to get it under control you prevented it down the line. He is on a regular worming program (same as all the other horses there) and yet he got these and no one else has.",

        "response":"Hi  it sounds like you have a real mess on your hands and you have done a lot to try to resolve it. If you are on your third veterinarian, Im not sure Im going to add anything new they havent already recommended. Too bad you are so far south and dont have a good killing frost coming up anytime soon!   First things first: has a biopsy been done to confirm the diagnosis? There is a slim chance you are dealing with something else, like sarcoids or cancer.   Regarding treatment for summer sores: youve used ivermectin, but maybe the larvae have become resistant to it. You could try moxidectin, which is relatively new and is more effective than other members of the ivermectin family sometimes. Ask one of your vets for the dose. The goal is to kill the larvae, then your horses hypersensitivity reaction should eventually go away. Have you used any steroids to decrease the hypersensitivity reaction? They must be used with caution in horses or they can cause founder. Have you used any antibiotics to help with secondary infections of the lesions? This might not be necessary, depending on the degree of secondary infections.   Now lets talk about prevention. Manure, manure, manure! Pick it up and get it away ASAP. Im sure youve read about the involvement of flies in the Habronema\/summer sores cycle. Can you keep all manure in a  mile area away from your horse at all times? Probably not if he is stabled with others. Can you change his stabling situation so he is the only horse for a mile or so? Then you would only have to deal with his manure which you could keep in a covered trash can and transport off site to be composted. Fly control is essential, too. Are you using something effective? Flies like mucous membranes so it is hard to use around the eyes safely, but covering him from stem to stern at least daily should help keep bites down; use a fly mask for his face. Clean and treat any wounds promptly and protect them with fly spray, too.   Have you tried using a feed-through fly control product with 2.12% cyromazine? This interferes with fly development and Habronema transmission. All horses on the property would need to receive it to be effective. If people do not want to feed this product, perhaps adding chickens to the property would helpthey hunt for fly larvae in manure and the environment. If they kick up a lot of dust, that isnt great for the horses lungs (especially any with heaves), but thats another problem   It may be time to consult a veterinary dermatologistperhaps there are new medications or treatments available through such a specialist. I hope you find something that works! Best wishes to you and your horse.",

I can tell you, however, that two of the images (those with scale bars present, the two on the left in my view) are definitely of psocid booklice. The third image, of a darker insect with a pointed head, appears to depict a nymph of some true bug species (Hemiptera: the order within which bed bugs are found); it may be a bed bug nymph. Several other bug nymphs can look similar, especially when trapping in an RV or other environment easily invaded by outdoor species.

It passes through the aphid, the aphid takes some of the sugar as it does, and then the remainder leaves the aphid's rear end and rains down as small droplets. If you stand under a tree that has a lot of aphids you can see it if the sun is right and you also can sometimes feel it. It will coat things that are under it with a shiny, sticky substance.

First question: pears don't need to be wrapped while completing the chilling period. A tissue or newspaper wrap can slow down moisture loss, but over the course of a few weeks that shouldn't be an issue. If the pears are going to be in the refrigerator for more than 4-6 weeks, it would be best to have them in a PERFORATED plastic bag (several holes throughout the bag surface, like is used in some lettuce bags). That way they can breathe, but still maintain a higher humidity level than in the open refrigerator space. Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Information about your mock orange can be found on the usda website:  http:\/\/plants.usda.gov\/plantguide\/pdf\/pg_phle4.pdf   Mock oranges (Philadelphus species) are deciduous flowering shrubs named for the orange-scented white blooms that can appear between May and July. Mock orange is adaptable to most soil conditions, although it prefers to dry out between waterings. Most problems associated with the mock oranges are moisture- and insect-related although they are susceptible to a variety of bacterial and fungal diseases. These include Gray mold, a fungal disease caused by the fungus Botrytis cinerea, as well as other species. While gray mold usually inhabits dead plant tissue it can invade stressed or weakened parts of its host plant or affect healthy plants at wound sites which are prone to infection. Gray mold can appear on any part of the plant especially in humid conditions, and appears as gray-hued web-like substance. If you have gray mold remove the affected parts of the plant ans destroy them far from the plant  also remember to sterilize all of your tools. Another fungal disease which affects mock oranges is Nectria twig blight, caused by the fungus Nectria cinnabarina. It appears as areas of dead tissue called cankers which then develop reddish=brown growth. Nectria twig blight is associated with excessive moisture. This is not a life threatening disease however sick portions of the plant should be removed and tools sterilized. Spots on the leaves that appear black or brown and look saturated with water are a symptom of bacterial blight,caused by the bacterium Pseudomonas syringae. Bacterial blight most often attacks mock orange trees when weather coosl and moisture is high. It causes dieback of shoots and leaf deformation. Once again removal of the diseased area is recommended and copper-based chemicals can be sprayed on according to directions to kill off the bacteria. Powdery mildew is a common fungus which tends to develop when the days are hot and humid and the nights are cool and humid. It appears as a white dust on affected leaves. Prune off affected areas, spray with copper fungicides or sulfur, water in the mornings and avoid overhead watering. Make sure your mock orange is in a place that gets plenty of air movement.  You said you did not observe bugs  the ones to look for on your mock oranges would be aphids, tiny insects, which can take on any number of colors hang out on the undersides of leaves and suck the sap. Plants with aphid damage tend to have yellow or curled leaves, stunted branch growth and may exhibit black spots caused by honeydew excretions. You can turn your hose on your bushes and wash the aphids off the leaves in the morning or treat with an insecticidal soap. The other common bugs found on mock oranges are leaf miners, which is a general term for larvae of several insects, such as flies or beetles, that lay eggs on the undersides of leaves. When the eggs hatch, the larvae eat the leaves, leaving holes. Look for holes and furrows in the leaves, browning or curling leaves and black specks on the leaf surface. Cut away the affected stems and apply insecticidal soap. Remember to move the leaves distant from the plant and clean your tools well. Your mock orange should be planted where it gets light shade in the afternoon and it needs well drained soil. They like to be well watered during their growing season and don't normally need feeding, however, you might want to consider giving it a good rose type fertilizer early next summer. Mock oranges do best if they are pruned regularly so yours may just need a good pruning; cut back the oldest, outer stems, remove any sucker growth and prune for shape. Making each cut just above a strong, outer facing bud or new shoot.",

The set of characters that make a beetle a scarabaeid do not change with location. In my mind you have three choices.   The entomology bible that college level entomology students use is Borror and DeLongs Introduction to the Study of Insects. This is a very serious book that students take classes in how to use it. New copies are expensive. You should be able to find used copies. See: http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Borror-DeLongs-Introduction-Study-Insects\/dp\/0030968356   The next best is Roger Bands How to Know the Insects. Its quite a bit cheaper and much easier to use although still challenging. See. http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/How-Know-Insects-Roger-Bland\/dp\/1577666844   And then is Petersons Field Guide  Insects. This is a pretty good reference for hobbyists.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The slobbering or drooling is from a fungus that has attached itself to the clover in your pasture. Unless you kill all the clover or remove your horse from the pasture with the infected clover. Slobbering Horse Syndrome, slobbers, and excessive drooling are all terms for this problem. The fungus is calledRhizoctonia leguminicola. This fungus produces an alkaloid called slaframine, which is responsible for the excessive drooling and slobbering. Slaframine stimulates the salivary glands and smooth muscles.The fungus most commonly affects clovers (red, white, and alsike) and alfalfa, and increases when these forages become drought-stressed or are exposed to prolonged wet conditions. It forms a black patch which may be visible on the leaves of the plant, hence the common name \"black patch.\" Pastures can vary in species composition from year to year due to environmental conditions, grazing pressure and management. White clover will increase in a pasture when conditions are favorable. If pastures are overgrazed, and the more productive cool season grasses such as timothy, brome, and orchardgrass are eliminated, white clover becomes very competitive. White clover will also increase if adequate soil fertility levels are not maintained and if warm temperatures in spring restrict the growth of cool season grasses. Change in pasture management (i.e. fertilizing, resting, and rotating pastures) can reduce the amount of white clover in a pasture. Change in environmental conditions, cool spring temperatures and drier summers with adequate rainfall will reduce the growth of the fungus on the plants. This is not a problem that occurs in all pastures every year. It is not uncommon for some horses in a pasture to be more severely affected than others. This might be related to whether or not they prefer clover over the other forages available in the pasture or have different levels of sensitivity to the toxin. Some horses may get ulcerations and scabs on the face and areas of the legs that come in close contact with the infected clover, as an allergic reaction to the fungus in the clover. To help eliminate salivation, remove horses from pastures with high clover concentrations, and begin mowing pastures until theRhizoctoniais no longer observed on the leaves. Clover can be suppressed by using a variety of herbicides such as Ally. Ally is relatively safe and has no grazing restrictions. Fertilizing pastures in spring, summer (if conditions warrant pasture growth), and in fall with 40-50 pounds of nitrogen per acre will provide the grasses with a competitive advantage over the clover. I hope this helps!",

        "response":"To whom it may concern, If there are mites, their population density will crash as temperatures decrease and moisture increases. With any luck, winter rains may soon arrive with regularity.  Removing too many live branches will reduce the stored carbohydrates in the tree and may cause stunting. Pruning mature trees should be minimal, and pruning of developing trees is usually aimed at creating the desirable structure and form for the site.

        "response":"Thanks for contacting eXtension with this concern. Ants are one of the most problematic pests, to which you can attest. Your step of sealing around the window is good, and having an exterior residual insecticide in place is one of the many management tools for this pest. Some ants will construct a nest within the wall voids, under the false floor under a sink, or in other out-of-the-way places. They may have started outside at one point in time, but if there is food, water and shelter inside, they are content to stay inside.A few other steps that you might find useful is: 1) keeping the counters free of food and food residue, wiping off syrup\/honey\/cooking oil bottles before replacing them in the cupboard, wiping up flour, sugar, or other food residues, and placing open food (stored at room temperature) in a heavy plastic ziplip bag or sealable container. 2) purchasing ant bait(s) at a grocery or hardware store and using them according to label directions. 3) Check your houseplants to make sure they don't have scales, mealybugs, or aphids. Ants will 'set up house' with insect colonies feeding on houseplants [maybe even making a colony in the soil of the houseplant]. Controlling the plant pests and associated ants should be done at the same time.Ant colonies are usually fairly large, so it may take considerable time to solve an ant problem. Using the services of a professional pest management firm may help solve the problem quicker and with longer lasting results.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi --I was unable to identify your vines by the photo, so I can give you only general information without knowing the needs or susceptibilities of this plant.When you have four plants that are theoretically similarly situated and cared for but one appears to dry out while the others fare well, in the absence of any signs or symptoms of pests or disease the obvious suspect becomes a difference in watering. Ironically, too much water can mimic not enough water in that over-watering can cause roots to cease functioning -- they \"drown\" without sufficient air in the soil. When that happens, the plant can't take up water and so dries up, just as it would if there wasn't enough water for working roots to take up. Excess water can also promote disease and rot roots, in which case there's little or no root system to access water. Again, the plant dries out despite the proverbial \"water water everywhere\".Outright \"drowning\" is more likely to occur in flood-type situations, whether because of quantity of water or lack of drainage when water is present, while damage from milder but chronic over-watering tend to accrue over a longer time. Along the way, over-watered plants may or may not show distress as yellowing and\/or wilting of leaves.Assuming these plants were equally healthy when you left, it may be that the watering schedule was too much for one of the vines. This might be because the emitters were not distributing water evenly, or perhaps because the drainage in that container was not as good as in the others, or because the exposure of the fallen plant called for less water than the others but the emitters weren't or couldn't be adjusted accordingly. Or, though the soil was moist at your return, perhaps this vine needed more water than the others and so dried out \"for real\"!Unfortunately, readily-available inexpensive drip systems are notoriously difficult to set up for container gardens. They can be helpful, but often need some human intervention to adjust to differing needs among containers (in the ground, there's more real estate to wick out what would be \"excess\" moisture in a confined space). Any watering system can be prone to excess if it's driven by timer rather than moisture sensors -- though in California drought this may not be quite as big a concern as elsewhere!Apart from the watering issue, you might look closely at the dried plant -- if you see a silvering or mottling of leaves and perhaps traces of fine webbing, it might be that the plant suffered an invasion of mites. These tiny insects literally suck the juices out of the leaves, which tend to remain, crisped, on the plant. Assuming the vines are in reasonable proximity to one another, it would be unusual to find one lethally infested and the others untouched, but it might be worth a look (and a good bath with a strong hose to blast any bugs off the others!).",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Chris,    This is just not a good idea. For one, beer bottles were not designed to handle that high temperatures needed for filling \/ processing the salsa. The second is that when putting in the hot water bath, pressure difference may cause the cap to come unseated, and third, the seals on the cap were not designed for hot water bath applications.    You should follow the guidance published by the National Center for Home Food Preservation on canning practices (http:\/\/nchfp.uga.edu\/) and use containers that were designed for hot water batch canning.

Some plants are considered tolerant or resistant, although there is little research to support any definite classification.

But with special handling, treatment or conditions are then okay to eat. Bitter almonds, rhubarb leaves, pokeberry, apple seeds, even green potatoes contain toxins -- poisons. All parts of the elderberry plant contain toxic alkaloids: the mystery writers favorite poison - cyanide. Even over-use of elderberry tea has proved fatal.  The special conditions that make elderberries edible involve two steps - one, that they be FULLY RIPE, and two that they be COOKED. As long as you understand that process, as tradition has passed down, you are safe. Unfortunately, without that specific knowledge, all parts of the plant are poisonous. Since most people do not bother to read the entire caveat,elderberries are listed as purely poisonous. Even one death by cyanide poisoning because someone did not read the entire article is just not acceptable.

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. Your ratios of grain seems appropriate for a mature working horse. My only concern is that they are only getting fed 3x per week, which is only 1.3 lbs per day if you average it over the day. Therefore that amount is really not doing much for their nutrition. I assume in the off times they are being fed hay or are on pasture or on a range? This will provide most of their nutrients however, I would consider increasing their feeding to once daily. With that being said this alone might help your one skinny horse. If it does not I highly recommend adding rice bran to the diet as was suggested. Rice bran is high in fat and will increase the calories in the diet without creating any problems. Horses can typically get 1-2 lbs of rice bran per day. I would start slowly however, and increase to 1 lb after the course of 1-2 weeks to make sure she does not have any digestive problems with it. Leave the amount at 1 lb and see if that changes her weight over the course of 1 month and if not slowly increase again to 2 lbs.Good luck and I hope this helps.",

Properly cured sauerkraut is sufficiently acidic to prevent the favorable growth of botulism. The pH changes during fermentation, thus is safe to can in a boiling water bath canner.    It is not recommended to ferment sauerkraut in jars. Because of their small size, it is difficult to prevent the cabbage from rising above the brine where it is likely to dry out or form mold. Fermentation, and thus the formation of acid, is less consistent and you will get a lower quality product. Use 5 gallon containers to ferment sauerkraut",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Normally you don't see this happening.  However, that strawberry seeds from most hybrid cultivars will  not reproduce true to form. Alpine varieties and heirloom seeds usually  will (along with a few of the new F1 cultivars), so factor that in when  planting strawberry seeds. Many strawberry seeds need to be cold treated to encourage  germination. If your selected strawberry seeds require this, fear not.  It is easy. Simply wrap your strawberry seeds, put them in an airtight  container, and place them in a freezer. This simulates winter  conditions, and the warming period lets the seed know it is time to come  to life. After keeping the strawberry seeds below freezing for two to  four weeks, remove the seeds from the freezer. Leave them in the jar or  container as they gradually warm up to room temperature. Once your strawberry seeds are at room temperature and are ready  plant, you need to create a hospitable place for your strawberry seeds  to begin their journey to planthood. A seed tray works well. Obtain a  seed tray and prepare it. A good mix for starting strawberry seeds is 3  parts peat to 1 part organic-rich soil. Spread this out in your seed  tray to a depth of about one half of an inch. Hope this answers your question and I am sure you had a hybrid variety of strawberries.",

    "title-question":"Memory and our senses. Hi. I am doing a project for the science fair called Making Sense of Memory. I have tried contacting lots of professionals for advice but so far no one has gotten back to me. I am doing a test on 40 people(20 boys and 20 girls) to see if their memories work better when using their visual sense or their auditory sense. I wanted to do this study so schools can help kids realize what kind of learners they are to help make them better students. My auditory memory is not as strong as my visual memory so I use lots of tricks to help me remember things. Like spelling word definitions(i always put a picture next to them to help me remember), etc... I wanted to ask an expert the following questions.  1) How does our memory affect our learning? 2) Is visual memory better than auditory and if so why? 3) Do boys have better visual memory than girls? 4) Is there some special test that schools can let kids take to help them determine what kind of learner they are? 5) How does the brain decide which memories or information to keep and which to throw away? 6) Is there a certain amount of memory our brains can hold? Is short term memory stored somewhere different in the brain than long term memory and is this why it only lasts for a little while? I hope someone out there can answer some of these questions for me and if you can thank you for taking the time. I have lots of other questions and I can't wait to see how my study comes out. My study is giving all 40 people a visual test on a picture I drew and colored that has 20 items in it you can remember. I have them look at it for a minute then write down as much as they can remember. Then I read them 20 items from a second picture and have them write them down. My study is about half done and so far almost every person has two times as much better visual memory than auditory and girls have better visual memory than boys and boys and girls have about the same auditory... but that is just so far...not done with the study yet. I hope my project proves how much kids need to figure out which of their senses they can use to help them best remember things so they can become better learners and students in school.

        "response":"Caitlyn:I love to judge at science fairs. The projects and research shared by students is always very interesting, and I always come away knowing more than I did when I got there! Your project sounds interesting, and it seems the results are in line with what researchers have found in the past.I \"googled\" some research on the topic, and found that \"Researchers at the University of Iowa have found that when it comes to memory, we don't remember things we hear nearly as well as things we see or touch.\"As it turns out, there is merit to the Chinese proverb 'I hear, and I forget; I see, and I remember,\" says lead author of the study and UI graduate student, James Bigelow. \"We tend to think that the parts of our brain wired for memory are integrated. But our findings indicate our brain may use separate pathways to process information. Even more, our study suggests the brain may process auditory information differently than visual and tactile information, and alternative strategies -- such as increased mental repetition -- may be needed when trying to improve memory,\" says Amy Poremba, associate professor in the UI Department of Psychology and corresponding author on the paper, published this week in the journalPLoS One. Bigelow and Poremba discovered that when more than 100 UI undergraduate students were exposed to a variety of sounds, visuals and things that could be felt, the students were least apt to remember the sounds they had heard. In an experiment testing short term-memory, participants were asked to listen to pure tones they heard through headphones, look at various shades of red squares, and feel low-intensity vibrations by gripping an aluminum bar. Each set of tones, squares and vibrations was separated by time delays ranging from one to 32 seconds. Although students' memory declined across the board when time delays grew longer, the decline was much greater for sounds, and began as early as four to eight seconds after being exposed to them. While this seems like a short time span, it's akin to forgetting a phone number that wasn't written down, notes Poremba. \"If someone gives you a number, and you dial it right away, you are usually fine. But do anything in between, and the odds are you will have forgotten it,\" she says. In a second experiment, Bigelow and Poremba tested participants' memory using things they might encounter on an everyday basis. Students listened to audio recordings of dogs barking, watched silent videos of a basketball game, and, touched and held common objects blocked from view, such as a coffee mug. The researchers found that between an hour and a week later, students were worse at remembering the sounds they had heard, but their memory for visual scenes and tactile objects was about the same. Both experiments suggest that the way your mind processes and stores sound may be different from the way it process and stores other types of memories. And that could have big implications for educators, design engineers and advertisers alike. \"As teachers, we want to assume students will remember everything we say. But if you really want something to be memorable you may need to include a visual or hands-on experience, in addition to auditory information,\" says Poremba. Previous research has suggested that humans may have superior visual memory, and that hearing words associated with sounds -- rather than hearing the sounds alone -- may aid memory. Bigelow and Poremba's study builds upon those findings by confirming that, indeed, we remember less of what we hear, regardless of whether sounds are linked to words.\"  You can find these research results at http:\/\/www.sciencedaily.com\/releases\/2014\/02\/140226174439.htm You might also want to review research findings shared at http:\/\/scienceline.ucsb.edu\/getkey.php?key=271.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"There are three key reasons for failure to fill in pistachios.          Do you have functional male and female trees? Males must be available to provide the pollen for pollination.          In some cases, pollination may occur, but because of weather conditions or nutrient issues, fertilization may not, resulting in shriveling of the ovule rather than fruit development. Pollination can stimulate fruit set, but then the nuts fail to fill. Filling is a two step process - the ovary (the shell of the nut) grows first, then the kernel expands to fill it, so problems with \"blanking\" or lack of fill may not be evident until later in the season.  Nutrition can play a role boron deficiency can be a factor in some areas. Have you had your soil and leaf tissue analyzed recently? Boron leaf levels need to be at least 120 ppm. Other nutrients may also play a role. Tissue testing at least every four or five years would be a good way to monitor the nutrient status of the tree.          In some areas of Northern California, especially in the lower foothills above the valley floor, a common reason for nuts not filling is insufficient heating units. Last summer and the summer before were relatively mild, so that may be factor.    The fourth possibility is drought stress. If there was insufficient available soil moisture before a period of high heat, that could also be a factor. Was irrigation adequate before the heat so that trees had adequate soil moisture during the period of heat? Irrigation can be a factor in failure to fill in mid-summer because the embryos (kernels) fail to expand and fill the shell.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"As you found sometimes a tomato fruit is produced that is abnormal with cavities pitted with scar tissue.  This is called catfacing, a physiological disorder of tomatoes   that results in the abnormal growth. It is called this since  the abnormal cracking and dimpling on tomatoes, peaches, apples and even  grapes, looks somewhat akin to a small cats face. This occurs because of the abnormal development of plant tissue affecting the ovary or female  sex organ (pistilate), which results in the flower, followed by the  fruit development to become malformed. The exact cause of catfacing is uncertain and could be  caused by any number of factors, but is probably due to unfavorable  growing conditions. Temperatures below 60 degrees F. for a number of  successive days when plants are immature  about three weeks prior to  blooming coincides with this disorder and causes incomplete pollination, which creates the deformity.  \t\t\t \t\t\t\t \t Other factors leading to catfacing are physical damage to the blossom, exposure to herbicides containing phenoxy, and excessive nitrogen. It is also found more often on large-fruited varieties, like beefsteak and heirloom types.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi Ed,I am assuming you mean bark type mulch and will answer accordingly.  If that is not correct, please send another question to Ask the Expert.     Some mulches may have chemicals added. If you want to be sure the mulch is chemical free, you can purchase products certified by the Mulch and Soil Council www.mulchandsoilcouncil.org. Avoid fresh wood chipswhichcan tie up nutrients, especially nitrogen. Mulch is very beneficial around fruit trees. It helps to conserve soil moisture, allowing you to water less often; keeps down weeds; reduces erosion; keeps plant roots cool; provides winter protection; and makes your yard more attractive. You might consider compost, instead of mulch, which can be very beneficial and adds nutrients to the soil.  Mature compost slowly releases nutrients into the soil giving your transplants increased protection, nutrients, and water availability near the roots.        Proper mulching will also help to keep your trees healthy. For trees and shrubs, spread mulch evenly to a depth of 2 to 3 inches. If they are in a bed, mulch the whole bed. If the tree is located in a lawn, mulch a wide ring, 3-6 feet out from the trunk, around each plant. Tree roots and turf compete and the turf usually wins!  Never pile mulch against the tree trunks. Pull the mulch away from the trunk about an inch or so. Incorrect mulching is the number one cause of death of trees and shrubs. When mulch is applied improperly by over-mulching or piling up mulch against the trunk of the tree the following problems occur:    Root Migration - when mulch is placed more than about 4 inches deep, roots tend to \"migrate\" up into the mulch during rainy periods or when the area is irrigated. This is partly due to (temporarily) favorable root growth conditions in the mulch and partly to the suffocation of deep roots due to mulch-induced water-logging of the underlying soil. Then, when drought conditions occur, volcano-mulched plants may come under severe stress because many roots are growing in the mulch material which has considerably less water-holding capacity than real soil. Some serious issues arise with improper mulching:    Root Suffocation\/Root Rot - tree roots must be able to take in oxygen. When mulch becomes waterlogged, root growth declines and the tree dies.    Inner bark death  Mulch piles high onto the trunk decreases gas exchange killing the inner bark.     Habitat for rodents &amp; insects  mulch layers against a tree trunk provides a perfect environment for these pests. If &gt;50% of the tree circumference is damaged, girdling occurs and little can be done to save the tree.    Fungal &amp; bacterial diseases  these organisms grow and reproduce in the moist, dark environment that over-mulching provides. They gain   access to the tree through stressed, decaying bark under a thick mulch layer, causing cankers, killing the inner bark, starving the roots and killing the tree.    Excessive heat  thick layers of mulch begin decaying and produce heat (similar to composting)    Waterproof layers - mulch can become a matted barrier that prevents the penetration of water and air, causing root dehydration.   As organic mulches decompose, they may need to be replenished somewhat every year, but do not let it build up to more than 4 inches.

      {
        "response":"Thank you for submitting your question to our site.  There is a lot more information I would need to know in order to best answer your question but I hope to provide you some basic information and links to specialists in your area.    The most important tidbit that would help us answer your question is what kind of soil you have?  You mention compaction and that definitely can be an issue in your area and it also affects the best type of soil aeration methods and future management for your redwood.  The best resource for you would be the local Master Gardeners of Orange County website found here:  http:\/\/uccemg.com\/Soils-Fertilizers-Compost\/?ds=547&amp;reportnumber=1013&amp;catcol=3821&amp;catego... The volunteers and University resources available through this website will not only help you with determining your soil type and best management for compaction, fertility, and amendments; but also with specific care of your redwood.  The pneumatic aeration method you inquired about is usually done with an \"air spade\" around trees and while it can be good for some trees, it can also damage others if not used properly.  Any type of aeration of turf or tree should be performed by a licensed professional.  Once again, the volunteer Master Gardeners can provide a wealth of information and resources to help you make the best decisions on soil aeration, especially once your soil type is known.  Other methods for maintaining your redwood may include mulching the root zone of the tree, watering properly,and discouraging foot traffic nearby, perhaps even constructing an elevated boardwalk if foot traffic must pass near the tree.  All of these can best be addressed by the local volunteers with the Master Gardener program or by contacting your local University of California Cooperative Extension office found here: http:\/\/ceorange.ucanr.edu\/   Good luck and I hope this information is helpful!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Chances are, your trees are suffering from the dry weather and drought stress. If your trees have been there 10 years and have good root systems, they should be able to survive with the methods they are showing now - dropping leaves and hanging on. If you are concerned they are in decline, make sure there is not a disease or pest problem and then, if that is not the problem, you could consider irrigation if it is worth it to you. The best advice could come from your local area.  You can check with your local Extension office or the California Department of Forestry (http:\/\/calfire.ca.gov\/contacts\/region.php?RID=11) and their community forestry program for information most relevant to your location.

        "response":"Your answer is yes you are early but that depends on the weather. Your pepper plant could dye from a frost but the chance of frost is low. Look here http:\/\/ucanr.org\/sites\/gardenweb\/files\/29030.pdfHere is more information :Don't be in a rush to transplant outside. Cold temperatures can weaken plants and they may never fully recover. A few days at 60 F to 65 F with reduced water will help harden plants and reduce transplant shock. Over-hardened plants grow slowly after transplanting. Set plants out 2 to 3 weeks after average last frost when the soil has warmed and the weather has settled. Plant them 12 to 24 inches apart, in rows 24 to 36 inches apart, or spaced about 14 to 16 inches apart in raised beds. Use black plastic and\/or row covers to speed soil warming and early growth. Use caution with row covers not to overheat plants and cause them to drop their blossoms. If not using black plastic, mulch plants after they are well established and the soil has warmed to retain moisture and control weeds.  Peppers can be temperamental when it comes to setting fruit if temperatures are too hot or too cool. Night time temperatures below 60 F or above 75 F can reduce fruit set. You can see the reasons for waiting until late March in your area but you can use black plastic mulch and a clear plastic row cover to plant early and that is our recommendation and thank you for using ask an expert",

This can require a great deal of work depending on the area you're trying to protect.  3) There are commercially available repellents (at most nursery or hardware stores with a garden section) that are designed to keep animals off of a treated area.

I'm sure you know Stephanie Larson with UCCE in Sonoma County. Stephanie has a long history of working with ranchers on predation issues.  I assume you know of the Wildlife Services (County Trapper). They would be another source of such accounts. If you're not familiar with them you can access them through the Sonoma County Ag Commissioner's office.

        "response":"Hello, Here we are, the cracking of bark or trunk wood is generally due to either winter injury or an imbalance of soil moisture- either flood conditions or extreme drought conditions. In the case of winter injury, and if the top of the plant above the crackingis showing signs of dying, the thing to do is to cut the plant back to below the injury and allow it to generate a new top.  If the top is not showing signs of decline, I would be tempted to leave it alone inspite of the crack. The crack allows ingress of disease and insect organisms, but in time the tree may generate sufficient callous regrowth to :closeup\" the opening and compartmentalize this wound.

Wild geranium, Geranuim maculatum contains tannins and has been used for years to reduce inflammation and stop bleeding, it is toxic to neither humans nor animals. Pelargoniums have also been used medicinally. P. sidoides and P. reniforme are marketed as Umckaloaba or Zucol for bronchitis and pharyngitis.P. graveolens leaves are used topically topically for scabies and other inflammations, this is the rose scented geranium which is often used to make tea which is said to be relaxing. The mosquito plant, P. citrosum has been shown not to actually repel mosquitos but is being looked at as an antiviral medication. All of the pelargoniums, but not the wild geraniums, contain geraniol and linalool both of which have antibiotic capabilities and have some bug repellent actions. They can cause rashes to people who have allergies to them and have been shown to be toxic to dogs and cats; but I can find no reported toxicity to humans.",

I suggest you check the packaging or online for the manufacturer's installation instructions, and make sure the ducting is installed to exhaust to the outdoors with a functioning damper, has no sharp turns or crimps, and the fan is caulked to the attic floor and duct is sealed to it to prevent air leaks into the fan housing.

        "response":"I doubt that we can be of any help without actual specimens. I'm a bit annoyed by the statement by your pest control professional because all the mites that are often associated withbites onhuman skin are easily visible (primarily bird mites and rodent mites). Human scabies mites are microscopic, but they can not live off the skin and they are easily diagnosed by a dermatologist. House dust mites are often found in homes, mainly in bedding and cloth-covered furniture, but these are too small to bite human skin, though they can cause allergies. What mite did the U.C. Davis entomologist identify? It is really unusual to find any kind of mites inside a home other than the dust mites! If you look up bird mites on the Internet, don't believe what these folks say! Both bird mites and rodent mites need birds or rodents in order to perpetuate their species. They can only live for a week or two without their primary hosts. During this time, they can bite human skin. These web sites claim that bird mites can live solely using humans as hosts, but there is no scientific evidence of this! I worked with northern fowl mites at Penn State and got bit many times, but only when I was in the chicken house! If you work outside in grassy areas, you could also get chiggers, but these normally only bite where there is elastic (around sock tops, underclothes bands, etc.). You wouldn't experience bites from these on you legs, arms, upper torso. I'm sorry that I don't have a better answer for you!",

        "response":"Hello and thanks for using the Ask an Expert System.   I wish there was a simple answer for your question, but I believe that there is nothing that you can do to reduce the need these trees have for water. Cottonwoods require the most water when they are young. Mature trees grow deep roots to tap into deeper underground sources. Your extended drought is depleting these underground sources.   In spring water is necessary to expand new buds and leaves. Small trees can be trimmed back to reduce leaf area and thus reduce water requirements. That is out of the question for 100 ft trees. Cottonwoods can drop some of their leaves early if a drought occurs in late summer.    I suggest that you contact a University of California Master Gardener in your county for more information appropriate your region.

        "response":"Hello Robert,A very interesting, and very challenging, question!Please keep in mind that I am an arborist and not a veterinarian, so my answer is based on my understanding of the plant, rather than the animal, \"side\" of this issue.You are right in that dogs and sago palms (Cycas revoluta) should be kept apart; the toxicity to dogs of the sago palm is well-documented, with mortality as high as 50% in some studies.It would be prudent to ensure that your dog cannot dig up the buried roots for some considerable time (months, or perhaps years).  While the buried roots will eventually break down, this process is very much dependent on there being available moisture in the soil (as well as other soil- and climate-related factors).  And, as you have undoubtedly noticed, we have not had much rain in California this year, and we are entering our dry season now (so, the buried roots will likely degrade only very slowly until the next rainy season). So, if you can either exclude your dog from the area where the roots are buried, or somehow prevent him\/her from digging there, that would be the safest course of action.  After the next season's rains, you can do some digging yourself and check to see if the roots have in fact disintegrated (and I would love to hear back from you with a report about how long it actually took for the roots to decompose!). But for now, the dog and the buried roots should be kept apart.Thank you for contacting eXtension!Igor  Igor LacanUrban Forestry AdvisorUniversity of California Cooperative Extension, Bay Areailacan@ucanr.edu",

        "response":"The spider in your image looks most like an immature western black widow, (although it could be a related spider in the combfooted spider family). See this webpage for confirmation and to distinguish between this native spider and the exotic invasive brown widow spider: How to identify Brown Widow Spiders http:\/\/cisr.ucr.edu\/identifying_brown_widow_spiders.html Pesticide applications are not usually warranted, since prime web sites will  usually get re-colonized within weeks or months given the local abundance of the  species. Removal with a vacuum (shop vac filled with soapy water) is a good  mechanical control tactic. Oftentimes, monthly vacuuming of a shop or garage  situation can really reduce widow incidence. The best approach in my opinion is  awareness. Learn how to identify the spiders and their webs, teach your family, and then be aware when working or playing in areas where  widows are likely to be (usually within one meter of the ground, sometimes a  little higher, cracks, crevices or corners protected from rain and sun during  the day). Widows are nocturnal and will be hiding in these cracks \/ crevices  during the day and will emerge at night to sit in the web and feed on insects  caught in the web. These spiders can sometimes be considered beneficial since  they consume cockroaches and other large nuisance insects.

        "response":"Monadenium coccineum is native to arid Tanzania. It is a member of the family Euporbiaceae. It grows best in full sunlight and dry soil. It does not tolerate moisture at ground level. It is reported to be easy to grow with minimal care. Allow the soil to completely dry before watering and grow in direct sunlight. Several Cooperative Extension publications provide asexual propagation advice: take stem cuttings just below a stem node with a sharp cutting knife or razor. One publication reports summer is the best time to propagate. The cutting should be 3 to 6 inches long. Buds should be removed from the bottom inch or two of the cutting, and any flowers on the cutting should be pinched off. Lay the cutting aside for several days for the cut base to suberize or dry and harden. Once the base of the cutting dries out, stick it in a sterile container with a mix of one part sand and one part sterile, soil-less growing media and place the cutting in direct sunlight. Be sure the cutting is anchored to protect the fragile roots from movement. It will take several months for the roots to grow. It is reportedly propagated from seeds, but no details were provided.

Most bulbs and corms will last for many years if stored properly, but will not perform at their best if not planted or replanted within 12 months of storage date. Depending on the plant, different curing and storage procedures are required. Bulbs\/corms in storage should be checked monthly. A healthy bulb is firm and plump, not withered and overly dry. If it crackles when you squeeze it, it is probably outdated. Additionally, if it feels soft or mushy, it need to be tossed, as rot has set in.   Here are some links to help determine preparation, curing, and storage requirements for specific plants. Check your USDA hardiness zone (probably 9b in Tulare County) to determine what is tender in your area. If the plant is not listed tender in your area bulbs and corms are safe left in the ground.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello,   It sounds like your dear old apple tree has bacterial wetwood (also known as slime flux. Unfortunately, trees that are older, growing in unfavorable conditions or without any cause can be susceptible to this disease. Bacterial wetwood is not usually serious but can be a chronic disease that can eventually cause the trees decline.   There are no effective control methods for eliminating wetwood. In the past, it was recommended to drill a hole into the infected area of the tree and insert a rigid piece of plastic pipe to relieve the pressure and move the ooze away from the trunk. In recent studies, this has been found to cause damage to sap-conducting tissue, and the practice is no longer recommended.     Other remedies used in the past involved wrapping the wound or applying wound dressings. Neither of these approaches will stop bleeding nor prevent the disease from spreading.      In most cases, it is best to leave the area alone and focus on maintaining the overall health of the tree. Steps should be taken to prevent damage to the root system and trunk especially near the crown.      The following strategies may help. Watering  Trees should be kept moist throughout the year to prevent stress. Established trees perform best when watered 12 inches to 18 inches deep and at least as wide as the canopy. Drought conditions can increase stress and wetwood problems. Fertilization                                                      Fertilize stressed trees to stimulate vigorous growth and lessen the severity of the disease but refrain from over fertilizing healthy vigorous trees as this may increase their susceptibility to the disorder.   Pruning                                                           Remove any dead and weak branches. It is advised to disinfect tools with 70% rubbing alcohol before pruning a tree.    Good Luck!",

Your cypress could be suffering from drought-related stresses or from pests (cypress tip miner is very common in the Bay Area: http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/GARDEN\/PLANTS\/INVERT\/cyptipminer.html), or from a combination of the above. I suggest you contact your county's UCCE Master Gardener program for diagnosis and management help: http:\/\/smsf-mastergardeners.ucanr.org\/Advice_to_Grow_By\/. They may be able to help based on a good digital photo, but most likely they will require a physical sample. Best regards, Andrew",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"This sounds like it could be a root problem. Root problems could be due to a number of issues such as poor drainage, improper soil moisture (too wet or dry), root-bound rootball, girdling roots, root rot (from wet soil and\/or fungal organism), and being planted too deep to name a few.I would suggest taking a close look at the soil around the root area by digging smalls holes several inches deep to check for wet soils. Pines, in general, do not like wet feet. Also, make sure the top of the rootball is right at the soil surface; if several inches below the soil surface, it needs to be raised up or soil pulled away from the top of the rootball. Pines do not like to be planted too deep. If the plant has not been in the ground for very long, you might carefully lift it back out of the soil and inspect the root system and make sure it is planted at the right depth.Because you said it keeps sending out new shoots on the sides makes me think it may not be a pine at all (pines are in the genus Pinus).Pines don't typically send out new shoots once the tips and all the other needles have fallen off.With all this said, the plant does sound pretty stressed and evergreens such as pines don't often recover well from such stresses. So, you need to evaluate if it is really worth trying to nurse this plant back to health or just replace it with a newer, healthier plant. Be sure to always positively identify your host plant and a cause, such as insect or disease, before spraying with a pesticide. Randomly spraying pesticides without knowing if there are even pests there is an unhealthy and costly practice.If you need further assistance I would recommend contacting your local County Extension Service Office or nursery\/garden center.Hope this is helpful!",

Without an actual specimen to examine under a microscope, actual species determination can be suspect. Jumping spiders are very common and are generally considered to be harmless as most are too small for their fangs to break human skin, and most species would only bite if you squeezed them or pinned them down so that they felt threatened. They are very active spiders with a pretty good sense of vision, so they quickly react to almost anything that moves in their environment. When they jump, they usually attach a temporary line of silk so that if they don't get a firm footing, they won't fall to the ground.",

      {
        "response":"Hi --Without a more thorough description (ideally, photographs!) of the insect or the damage that resulted in plant death, it's hard to come to a reliable conclusion!  But with that warning, I'm going to make a guess based on a common risk to a plant that has few lethal insect enemies:Garlic grows relatively pest-free, but it is susceptible to thrips, teeny insects that typically go unnoticed until the damage they cause becomes evident.  They do their damage by biting into the plant and sucking out the juices. Of course, because they're so small, it takes a bunch of thrips to do enough damage that it becomes readily visible -- typically patches, then whole leaves, drying with a silvery cast -- by which time a serious infestation has been established. Plus, they prefer to hide, and eat, in the base of the leaves close to the bulb, so you typically won't see them until they get crowded out of hiding and move upwards in the plant. Yes, they appear to come back fast because by then there's lots of them!There are thousands of types of thrips affecting different hosts, but the two types that affect garlic are \"onion thrips\" (Thrips tabaci) and \"western flower thrips\" (Frankliniella occidentalis).  The adult insects are not particularly soft (but certainly small enough to squish easily), while their larvae (which can also feed on plants) would be \"squishy\" like most larvae are.Here's a fact sheet on our suspects from the University of California's Integrated Pest Management Program:http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/r584300111.htmland a thorough, detailed article (geared toward commercial onion crops, but with pictures of the pest and its telltale damage) from the Utah State University extension:https:\/\/extension.usu.edu\/files\/publications\/factsheet\/ENT-117-08PR.pdfAssuming it is thrips infesting your garlic, your instincts in using the garden hose for combat are good! It may take a bit of persistence and a lot of vigilance, but in the home garden the best bet is to stay ahead of these pests rather than trying to wage a (no less persistent and vigilant!) chemical war. Just be sure to inspect regularly and thoroughly, and apply that hose to all the nooks and crannies!",

Cyanide poison symptoms develop anywhere from 15 minutes to several hours following ingestion. The symptoms include excitement and increased respiration followed by gasping and increased heart rate. Excessive salivation, tearing eyes, vomiting, involuntary voiding of feces and urine, spasms, staggering, and collapse into coma occur quickly, shortly before death.

      {
        "response":"Unless you have an air gap or chemically treated root barrier between the soil and your compost\/worm bin, these are most likely roots. Living roots are white or light colored and have distinguishable cross-sectional rings\/layers. They creep in from nearby (or not-so-nearby) plants due to the abundance of nutrients and moisture. Fungal hyphae can be light in color, yellow, or black and snap apart similar to a fresh mushroom and lack the layers a root tends to exhibit.I had this issue with my compost bin with tightly placed concrete pavers as a bottom. When I left it without turning for several weeks at a time, roots from my neighbor's Tree of Heaven made a far from heavenly situation. I started turning the pile more frequently and the roots couldn't get established.I do see worms, so there are still some good signs in the image. Bring a sample just like that to your Extension office for a full diagnosis.

      {
        "response":"Hello, The best time to control Scotch broom with broad spectrum non selective herbicides is BEFORE it blooms.Generally non selective herbicide will kill any plant that is actively growing. Once it blooms however, you will have to also remove the flower heads to prevent reseeding of the area.  You can also try repeated shearing and removal of top growth. over time this will weaken the plant and kill it. If you try to dig it out, you will probably have roots that will resprout. You can try a combination of techniques: Shear it back, wait till you have a lot of new vigorous growth and then hit it with the herbicide. You may get some regrowth, but again, keeping the top killed back will eventually also result in the death of the roots Good luck.",

Do you have nests of swallows, swifts, sparrows, or some other bird species on \/ in this structure? If so, then removal of the nests will be the proper management of these insects. Most birds are protected during nesting season, so you may have to wait until the fall to remove nests and take preventive measures to exclude the birds from nesting next year. You can submit specimens of your insects to your county's UCCE Master Gardener program for positive ID: http:\/\/ccmg.ucanr.edu\/Ask_Us\/ You can also try to ID these critters yourself, though it may be hard within this particular order: http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/67 http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/141062 http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/342602\/bgpage I hope this info helps.

        "response":"It sounds as if these are barklice then, based on the absence of birds and the presence of lichen. They do not damage structures and are not usually managed as pests. There is no need to do anything about these insects, but abundant lichen may indicate excess moisture on \/ in the structure. This is also likely a seasonal phenomenon since dry and hot weather (on its way) will knock back the lichen growth and cause a population crash of the barklice.

The use of licensed professionals that design to applicable codes or a \"reasonable standard of care\" will help the owner to better manage the risk.Logistically, if the fence was to be directly bolted to a concrete slab, an adequate baseplate and post element should be designed \/ built to meet calculated loads. If the slab was cored, the size of the core would depend on the embeddingdepth of the post \/ pier, the size of the post and the required protective covering of concrete.

Lydia's broom (Genista lydia) is also known as common woadwaxen or dyer's greenwood, although these common names typically refer to another broom (Genista tinctoria).  The plant is native to Europe and western Asia and is considered a weed in Britain and the United States but does not appear on the noxious weed list of either California or Nevada.  Noxious weeds are so designated by either federal or state statute or declaration and there are usually prohibitions on their planting, propagation, and importation.  California does list one genus of Genista, Genista monspessulana , (French broom), as well as Cytisus scoparius , (Scotch broom), on its State Noxious Weed List.  Nevada has neither plant listed ( http:\/\/plants.usda.gov\/java\/noxious?rptType=State&amp;statefips=32) .  Since neither state specifically prohibit the planting or propagation of the plant you are interested in, Lydia's broom, you should be able to plant it without much difficulty.  The Cornell Woody Plants Database states that the plant is a \"low, spreading shrub\" that \"Thrives in hot sunny spots of low fertility\" and \"Can tolerate acid to alkaline soil (pH 5.0 to 8.0)\".  It will do best in moist, well drained soils but can tolerate occasional periods of dry soil.  Considering all of this information, with proper care and maintenance, you should be able to plant Lydia's broom and enjoy it in your landscape.  Please feel free to contact your local county extension office or this site again if you have any further questions.",

        "response":"It sounds like the typical shatter - is it more than is generally observed each year? It is also called coulure. However, it usually occurs when the temperatures are less than 60 degrees, so that doesn't make sense. It can be caused by the pull of carbohydrates away from the clusters, which causes the drying up of the peduncle and the rachis, and berry drop. So, one suggestion is to tip the shoots when bloom occurs during particularly cool periods to minimize the competition for carbohydrates and help with fruit set. I hope that this helps - but as long as your nutrition is adequate, then the shatter is most likely due to the cool weather exacerbating the demand for carbohydrates in the vine.",

They \"tent\" the fruiting zone so that they can increase the temperature, increase growth and fruit set in their vines.   A professor up in British Columbia has published a few papers on this, and was the basis for their practice -  Impacts of using polyethylene sleeves and wavelength selective mulch in vineyards. I. Effects on air and soil temperatures and degree day accumulation. P. A.  Bowen, C. P.  Bogdanoff, B. Estergaard. http:\/\/pubs.aic.ca\/doi\/abs\/10.4141\/P03-093.  This might be an option for your vines, particularly if there is a stretch of cool weather occurring during bloom. Most of the Puget Sound growers just go to Costco or Sam's club and get the large rolls of polyethylene and walk down the row, or have fashioned an applicator that attaches to a 4-wheeler.  I hope this helps! Cheers, Mercy",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi Carol --It sounds like there could be any number of reasons your peach may have stopped in its tracks, but it certainly sounds stopped!  When a plant remains stunted with no other sign of disease on leaves or branches, failure to thrive can be the result of improper planting, unsuitable site selection (which, more to the point, is selection of an unsuitable plant for a given site!), poor soil quality or fertility, drought (insufficient or improper watering) or the plant itself may have had problems beforehand.In any case, your problem is definitely not pruning -- though young fruit trees can use some training\/pruning, pruning is not essential to growth.  I'm curious as to your choice of Elberta peach, which is a variety that is not typically recommended for southern California growing.  Elberta requires a bare minimum of 600 chilling hours (hours under 45 degrees Fahrenheit), while there are several varieties of peach bred for warmer climates that require less, even as few as 200 hours.   While this may be possible in the highest of high desert, the University of California's Fruit &amp; Nut Research Center lists Palmdale and Palmdale Central as the only research stations of 11 in Los Angeles County reporting sufficient cumulative chill hours for this peach. See:http:\/\/fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu\/Weather_Services\/chilling_accumulation_models\/Chill_Calculators\/ )  where you can find links for more information about required chill for fruit trees. Start at the home page of UC Davis' Fruit and Nut Research and Information Center for leads to all sorts of resources on peach (and any other fruit or nut!) growing in California:http:\/\/fruitsandnuts.ucdavis.edu\/Without more information, it would be impossible to guess what might be going on with your peach-baby!  I'm going to suggest you get in touch with your local Los Angeles County University of California Master Gardeners, who will have a much better idea of specific needs and conditions in your area (and be familiar with the myriad aspects of LA County given the wide range of climates in your area!).  Here's their web page, which has both phone and email contacts for assistance:http:\/\/celosangeles.ucanr.edu\/UC_Master_Gardener_Program\/Growing peaches can entail a fair amount of TLC, Carol. They're prone to several diseases and pests, and when you are successful you'll have competition from wildlife for the spoils of your labor!  You can help prevent peach headaches (or heartaches!) by carefully selecting an appropriate variety for your site and ensuring it gets properly planted in well-prepared soil. Get in touch with your local MG's and they should be able to help you decide whether there's something you can do with what you have, or perhaps start over with a variety that can perform reliably well for you. Good luck!",

People are easily frightened of spiders, especially in the house---regardless of the size or species of the spider. Having worked with an arachnologist for quite a few years at NMSU, spiders submitted to him as potentially dangerous have never had any association with venomous attacks on anything but their usual arthropod prey and most were too small or their fangs were too small to bite into or through human skin anyway. Probably the best source of scientific information on hobo spiders is Rick Vetter from the University of California, Riverside.

        "response":"Hi --It's hard to see detail in this photo, but there doesn't seem to be any obvious signs of insect infestation or disease pathogens (e.g. fungal infection).  Without more information as to early symptoms, how long this tree has been in trouble, etc., we can only take a best guess!What is visible is that the plant appears to be dying at least in part from lack of water.  The soil looks very dry, compacted and heavy, and the plant is in a plastic or resin pot that can cause problems with moisture control.  Roots need both water and air. They get air from the pockets between soil particles, which fill with water for short amounts of time.  If those pockets don't drain sufficiently or quickly enough, roots drown.  This can lead to root death and fungal root rots.  When the roots go, the top of the plant can't get water, and so dies just as if it were simply taken out by drought.Old, heavy, compacted dirt in containers doesn't drain well, and can pool at the bottom.  This happens more easily in plastic pots, whereas good old (unglazed) clay pots are porous and so allow some evaporation from the depths of the pot as well as from the surface of the potting medium.  The potting medium itself is important, too:  Garden soil is too heavy and will compact in a pot.  Containers call for a lighter-weight, even soilless, mix.  When watering containers, the best practice is to water deeply but less frequently, rather than watering incompletely more often.  Containers that get completely dried out are difficult to rehydrate -- water can run around the edges to the drainage holes at the bottom and literally bypass the roots.  Some dried-out potting media can literally repel water, such that when you water the top may look moistened, but if you stick a finger an inch in the soil will be dusty dry.Unless you have additional detail that might change the possible cause of your tree's demise, you should consider repotting this tree in a healthy mix.  Inspect roots for disease, damage or overcrowding, and trim dead, dying or girdling (a root system can choke itself with some roots going all the way around others) roots.  Once potted, prune out any dead branches; you can head back some upper branches to encourage lower growth.The Clemson University extension has a nice fact sheet on pomegranates:http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/hgic\/plants\/vegetables\/tree_fruits_nuts\/hgic1359.htmlPomegranates are lovely plants that have proven to do well in containers.

        "response":"Dear San Bernardino,Based on your description I believe you have scale. I have attached a picture of scale to confirm. Depending on the size of your tree you can spray with an agricultural or horticultural oil which essentially smothers the pest (Where plants can be sprayed, complete spray coverage of infested plant parts with horticultural oil at the proper time provides good control of most scales. Horticultural oils (e.g., Bonide Horticultural Oil and Monterey Horticultural Oil) are specially refined petroleum products, often called narrow-range, superior, or supreme oils. Other nonpersistent, contact sprays for garden and landscape plants include insecticidal soap (Safer Brand Insect Killing Soap Concentrate II), neem oil (Bayer Advanced Natria Neem Oil Concentrate, Green Light Neem, Garden Safe Brand Neem), canola oil (Bayer Advanced Natria Multi-Insect Control), and other botanical (plant-derived) oils.)If it is a larger tree you may need to use a systemic insecticide applied to the base of the tree like(acetamiprid, dinotefuran, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam). Your local nursery can be very helpful if you decide to go this route. ",

Some of the species that feed on grasses, field crops and weeds in fields can appear in large numbers as they can be attracted to lights at night. They can be a real nuisance during one of these flight periods, but they should do no harm to people, pets or structures. They suck juices out of plants. The third image is of a small moth, again too unclear in the image to make a species identification. It doesn't appear to be one of the stored products caterpillars or a clothes moth.

You can contact your local Agricultural Commissioner's office and see if the county provides a trapping service.  To alleviate the problem it might require re-configuring the portion of the garden which is attracting them. Can you place poultry wire around your plants below the mulch layer? This would inhibit them from digging.  You could also temporarily \"cage\" your plants to create a barrier. Once the animal's behavior has changed, and hopefully they moved on, you can remove the cages....until they return.  I know of people who have used motion-sensor sprinklers with success, but with the drought water may be limited.  There are commercially available repellents (OSH and other nursery outlets).

        "response":"Swamp coolers are fairly simple devices, so they seldom have problems.  If you are getting enough air through the cooler then it may be due to the pads are drying out or have dry spots with not enough water wetting the pads. Make sure the pump is delivering enough water.  It could be that the pads are getting dirty and as the dry dust and lint is wetted it is swelling and blocking some portion of the pad and replacing the pad will solve the problem.  We use outside air to blow though the pads. Windows doors or other openings are needed to exhaust the air back outdoors.   If the humidity is above 50% for the air going into the pad, the swamp cooler will not cool very well.  The bottom line is you need to have: Good airflow in and out of the house.  Well wetted pads.  Intake air well below 50% humidity.  Hope this gets you back to cool.",

    "title-question":"Im in love with my teacher and do you think he loves me too. So this whole thing started last fall. I had just started high school and had this gorgeous 9th grade math teacher. He looked like he was in his mid 20s. Unfortunately, I wasnt really good at math so I couldnt impress him. But, fortunately, he was offering private tuitions. So, my mom hired him to help me out on Saturdays. This gave me the chance to have alone time with him and get to know him personally.He gave tuitions at a coffee shop and we would always sit right next to the window. He was really cool. We had short breaks and during those short breaks he would tell me funny stories or we would talk about movies and music. It was after winter holidays that I finally opened up to him. But, I didnt do it face to face. I sent him a text. His reply was: Oh, Im so sorry. I already have a girlfriend and its a serious relationship. But, I appreciate your honesty.. My heart sank and I froze in complete utter shock. I had no idea he was in a relationship. I was in tears. After a while I started thinking. Was he really in a relationship or did he just make that up? Did I just make a huge mistake sending him that text? Will I ever see him again? I had checked his facebook profile and it didnt say anything about his relationship status. I also didnt find any pics of him alone with a girl. If he really was in a serious relationship wouldnt he have mentioned it on his profile and wouldnt he have added pics of his gf?The tuitions still continued. He didnt say anything about the text to my mom or me. Everything was the same. I was a little upset that he didnt talk about it with me. Why didnt he? And, why he acted so normal? Pretending nothing happened. Why did he still continue offering me tuitions? Was it for the money or was it because he secretly liked me and didnt want to admit it? Does he really have a gf?

      {
        "response":"I am glad that you are asking about this and hope my answer is helpful. I think it is really normal to have feelings for someone who is helping you especially when you find him easy to talk to. People who go to school to become teachers do so because they like helping kids and as a math teacher he probably really likes helping kids to enjoy math just like he does. Teachers also learn a code of ethics which are guidelines on how to behave with students. Some of the guidelines make sure that both the student and the teacher are protected. That is probably why he does tutoring in a coffee shop and why he doesn't put his status in his Facebook profile. Teachers can lose their jobs and their teaching license if they aren't careful to follow the guidelines. Not saying anything about it to you may have been so you weren't embarrassed.I strongly encourage you to talk to a trusted adult about your feelings, there is no need to be embarrassed, your feelings are normal. Can you talk to your Mom or an aunt or one of the counselors at school? Sorting out your feelings with an adult will help you put things in perspective and hopefully understand why your teacher needs to keep his personal life separate from his professional life.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"No, avoid those websites with the scare tactics and outlandish stories.Collembola or 'springtails' are very common and abundant creatures, many of which live in the soil where they feed on decaying plant matter, fungi and bacteria. Many are considered 'signs of healthy, well-enriched soil.'Others feed on pollen, algae, and even the feces of other arthropods. A few are predators on other collembolans or other tiny arthropods. If you've heard of 'snow fleas' these are the collembolans that may show up occasionally on the surface of snow, hopping around and likely feeding on whatever microorganisms or fallen organic matter that might have been deposited there after the snow fell. Some of these masses of 'snow fleas' are colorful---pink, blue, gray or green.At times, springtails can be common on the surfaces of water puddles or around their edges. If the sun is bright and temperatures are high, their presence is brief.Some species may be found under loose bark of trees, in rotten logs, leaf litter, compost piles, mushrooms and similar situations. The vast majority are just 1-2mm long. With their soft bodies, most require relatively high humidity to survive. In the arid Southwest, we see springtails indoors in homes around bath tubs, sinks and drains when we have our summer rains. There's nothing for them to eat indoors and the humidity decreases to lethal levels when the rains taper off. They are not considered household or structural pests.While there's some variability in the mouthparts, they are always concealed inside the head. None are known to attack humans or other animals---externally or internally.For that, you have to look for other orders of arthropods---and those afflictions would be quite easy for medical doctors or ER personnel to find, identify, confirm and treat. No insecticides would be involved---either for the premises or the patients. I hope this helps.",

        "response":"Hello,Thanks for your question. It looks like you are experiencing blossom end rot. Here's some information on BER from one of our Master Gardeners-Jean Natter.The fundamental causes of blossom end rot (BER) are deficiency of calcium in the plant and moisture stress. Calcium uptake by the plant may be inadequate for any of the following reasons: - There is insufficient calcium in the soil.- Excess nitrogen, magnesium, potassium, or sodium has been applied as fertilizer.- Very wet or very dry conditions interfere with the uptake of calcium.- Windy exposure and\/or very low humidity- Growing in a container where root room is limited.- Some kinds of tomatoes are more susceptible than others, among them Roma.The keys to avoid BER:- Supply adequate calcium by adding lime to your soil every 2 to 3 years, the amount as directed on the package label.- Use only moderate amounts of fertilizer.- Plant in well-drained soil.- Provide adequate irrigation to maintain evenly moist soil.- When needed, temporarily protect the plants with a windbreak or with shade, the latter on a suddenly very bright, clear day.Additional resources for you:- Much of the above is adapted from Blossom End Rot. But please notice that the comment in that publication about using a calcium chloride spray is outdated information.

Seriously, it sounds to me without a lot of additional information that your trees not be getting pollinated correctly. Avocados have male and female flower parts but they dont always pollinate themselves very well because the male parts open at a different time than the female parts.  It would be best to have another tree of the correct type to pollinate your Holiday cultivar.  One dwarf type tree that would make a good pollinator is Littlecado avocado. There is more informationhere: https:\/\/flowerdalenursery.com\/Avocado.html This other link has important information about the pH and nutrient requirements of avocados, and if you have not already you will want to do soil testing once a year to be sure to be supplying the nutrient needs and acidity levels needed.    http:\/\/ceventura.ucanr.edu\/Gardening\/Garden_Info\/avocado_questions\/ good luck!",

As summer arrives, the accompanying heat and dryness \"tells\" the cottonwood that it cannot support all the leaves it produced in spring.  So it yellows and drops a few leaves.  At least that's what we might call this leaf yellowing and dropping in Colorado.In any case, your iron application probably won't hurt anything, but it won't prevent the cottonwood from yellowing and dropping some leaves.Sorry these plants are not what you expected...but cottonwoods may get much too large for the area allotted for them.",

        "response":"Imported fire ants will often damage plants, especially during periods of dry weather. They will also \"farm\" aphids to collect the honeydew they produce to feed their colony, but when farming aphids, they usually do not also damage the plants. It is best to find the source of the foraging ants (their colonies or mounds) to limit their damage to you home garden plants. Once the colony(ies) has(have) been located, you will want to control that colony. There are baits in the marketplace that can be effective, but you might want to consider drenching the mound with an insecticide mixed in water. Make sure the insecticide you use is one that is approved for use in home gardens. Do not use acephate (Orthene) that is commonly recommended to control fire ants. It is systemic and might be taken up by the plant if the mound is actually located in your garden. Use a common watering can. Mix the insecticide as the label recommends for use in the home garden in water in the can. Then drench the mound by pouring the liquid first around the mound and working inward to eventually drench. The bigger the mound, the more liquid that is needed to completely drench it to achieve total control. If the mound moves, retreat.

        "response":"Mike, it is possible to grow Amaryllis from seed. It will take 2 - 4 years for the plant to bloom when propagated this way, but it does create more vigorous plants than propagating from bulbs. Plant seeds by placing them on the surface of moist potting soil in flats or pots and covering them with clear glass or plastic to maintain proper humidity. In your region, you may be able to get away with sowing them directly in the ground, covering them with a very light layer of soil so they don't blow away. A low percentage of seeds will germinate, so plant enough to cover any losses. Young plants will look like tiny blades of grass or onion sprouts. When roots begin to develop, transplant to individual pots or gently move transplant to other parts of the garden. Make sure the potting soil or the garden area remains moist while the plants are young and delicate. Otherwise, treat the seedlings the same way you would a mature bulb.Good luck with your gardening adventure!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"sounds like the water and soil amendments may have been detrimental.Merv Turner, the hybridizer responsible for the Bush Gem series wrote an article in the August 1986 publication of the Australian publication Gardenscene. He set down the following 5 rules for the cultivation of Kangaroo Paws.     Plant in a sunny and open      position in the garden. If in a frosty area, plant under eaves on the      south side of the house or under a high tree canopy.  Provide these plants with      excellent drainage.  In summer dry climates provide      these plants with regular water (providing the drainage is good) to keep      plants evergreen.  Fertilize, but not heavily, and      keep Phosphorus on the low side.  Annual clean up. After the      flowering period remove the old leaves down to as low as possible. Fans      only flower once and need to be cleaned out at the end of a season. Care      should be exercised that the new emerging fans are not damaged.   Planting Although plants can be established at any time of the year, it is best to plant during the cooler months: either late in the fall or in early spring. If one is planting in a location where medium frosts are expected, protect plants with mulch or wait until spring to plant. A sunny position in the garden is generally best although many of the species and hybrids will grow and bloom in an open light shade. If the location suffers from hard frost, plant in a sunny spot under eaves or under the protection of a tree canopy. Kangaroo Paws do best in, and in fact some will tolerate only well drained soils. A. flavidus, the most common species in cultivation in the US, and parent to most of the common hybrids, tolerates heavier soils than the others, but still responds to more favorable conditions. It is reported that A. manglesii and rufus also will take heavier soils and that all three tolerate seaside conditions.   Irrigation Summer irrigation seems to shorten the life span of Kangaroo Paws, for all species except A. flavidus, yet many of the hybrids will look best if given ample water until the flowering period is over in late summer. Many of the species come from areas of prolonged summer drought and will tolerate similar conditions in cultivation; these species tend to be summer dormant and are easily rotted if given water once in dormancy. For the best production of flowers the cut flower industry in Australia has been advised by their Agricultural Department to drip irrigate on sandy soils daily during the summer. A fertilizer can be supplied through irrigation water. In California, cut flower growers keep stands evenly moist until flowering has finished in fall. In the landscape Kangaroo Paws can be irrigated in a different manner. A. flavidus, A. humilis, A. rufus, A. manglesii and A. pulcherrimus are all species that grow well in dry summer climates. Many of the better hybrids have one or both of these plants as parents and likewise can be treated in a similar manner. These plants can be grown with other Mediterranean climate plants in a dry, or infrequently irrigated garden. It is still advisable to use drip irrigation when irrigation is performed, as this lessens susceptibility to disease.",

        "response":"Spireas grow well is relatively warm and dry conditions. They do not want wet leaves all the time or soggy soil all the time. That leads to root rots or fungal leaf diseases.We suspect that your spirea may be getting too much moisture from rain and watering. Never water overhead, i.e. sprinkling or hosing from above. Apply water to the soil at the base of the plant. Most plants grow well with about 1\" of water a week. Supplement rainfall by watering your spirea only when at least the top 1\/2 to 1 inch of soil has dried out.Also, brush off loose leaves and remove dead leaves. ECn ",

        "response":"UPDATE: I received a response from a colleague at WSU who is a native Italian and expert on pears. He confirmed that this low chill cultivar does not need chilling to ripen. It is harvested the last week of July in the southern areas through the first part of August in the northern regions. This Italian cultivar is not grown commercially in the U.S. so there is very little information about it in English. It is harvested in August in Italy and is low chilling, thus can be considered a summer pear, similar to Bartlett (Williams). It can likely be harvested at similar firmness as Bartlett, from 15-17 lbs. force (psi), and will probably not require any cold storage to ripen. However, it is advisable to store the pears to be eaten later in the refrigerator to delay ripening. Trial and error will be necessary in your climate. I have requested more information from an Italian colleague and will forward it when received. Best of luck!",

      {
        "response":"The beetle in your photo is a ponderous borer, scientific name: Trichocnemis spiculatus (formerly Ergates spiculatus). It belongs to the beetle family Cerambycidae, which are called long-horned beetles because of their very long antennae. This is one of the largest beetles found in North America. However, it is not 8 inches long!. The measuring tape you are using is metric, so from your photo, this beetle is actually about 65-70 mm in body length, which is actually about 2-1\/2 to 2- 3\/4 inches, which would be about the normal maximum size for this beetle. This species is found in the western U.S. and is associated with coniferforests. The larvae of these large beetles feed on the roots and lower trunks of dead and dying pine, Douglas-fir and a few other types of conifer trees, and take several years to complete development. They do not attack living trees and are not considered pests, although their tunneling through the wood might cause some damage to logs that are destined for cutting into lumber. The adults generally do not feed and are considered harmless, although they have powerful jaws and can give a painful bite if carelessly handled. They normally fly at night and are often attracted to lights, which is likely why this one came to your house. They might also be attracted to the smell of recently cut conifer wood. They have occasionally been known to emerge from the wood of recently built log homes; however, in these instances the larvae were already inside the logs used to build the homes, and did not attack the home after it was built. Adults will only lay their eggs on newly dead logs or trunks that still have their bark intact. I have include a few links to sites on the internet with more information and photos of this beetle.  http:\/\/www.bentler.us\/eastern-washington\/animals\/insects\/beetles\/ponderous-borer-beetle.aspx http:\/\/bspm.agsci.colostate.edu\/files\/2013\/03\/Ponderous-Borer.pdf",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I suggest taking plants to a state diagnostic lab to confirm it is indeed Verticillium wilt. There are imitators for several diseases. Control measures often are disease specific. It is possible the cause of symptoms is a different pathogen or is non-biological (physiological), and so different measures would be more appropriate to rectify the problem. What plants are affected? Eggplant is highly susceptible. Most tomato hybrids have resistance; thus Verticillium wilt is rarely a problem for commercial tomato growers anymore.  Successfully managing a pathogen in soil is challenging because it is difficult to reach the target there by applying something. There are some biopesticides labeled for this disease (for example, Actinovate) that might help. The pathogen can be moved in soil. You could get a foot bath to step into as you go inside (these are common at commercial greenhouses). Or change to shoes that are dedicated to the indoor garden. It is possible to bring insects and air-dispersed spores in from outdoors on you so I suggest trying to schedule all of your indoor garden work for first thing in a day before working outdoors. Dont give up completely on the outdoor garden  plant something that isnt susceptible to Verticillium wilt.",

    "question":"What could be eating all of my brussels sprouts, romanesco, broccoli, and cabbage? And what should I do about it",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The vegetables in your garden that are being eaten are all brassicas and in your area (Riverside, CA) there are at least 5 different insects that find those vegetables irresistible. There are 4 different cabbage worms ( from the butterfly family Pieridae) that it could be. Most commonly the caterpillar of Piers ropaeis green with short, fuzzy hairs on its body. The cabbage looper is smooth, green and has white stripes. It is called a looper because it moves like an inch worm. The cabbage web worm is found mostly in the gulf states so that is probably not it. The diamond back moth which lays eggs that develop into a smooth green caterpillar is another possibility. Check under the leaves and look for one of these caterpillars. Because you are in Southern California it could also be a Bagrada bug infestation. The Bagrada is an invasive species native to Africa which was found in Southern Cal in 2008.The bugs are shield shaped and black, orange and white markings identify them. They are about a 1\/4\" long and active in the warmest part of the day -- look for them then. As you know trying to deal with infestations on food crops is difficult. You may pick off the caterpillars by hand or try shaking the plant over a piece of cloth or plastic to dislodge the \"critters\". I know that is difficult with a rooted plant but if you have Bagrada bugs many should fall free. Pyrethrum may suppress adults while insecticidal soaps or azadirachtin may control nymphs. If you use any type of insecticide READ THE DIRECTIONS CAREFULLY AND FOLLOW THEM EXPLICITLY!!! The best thing to do is cover those crops with row covers in the spring or early summer when the insects are becoming active to keep them from landing and laying eggs on your brassicas.Good luck",

        "response":"Thanks so much for the detailed response. I have a neem oil that is labeled for organic gardening and states that it can control fungus and insects. Would this be acceptable for use on brassicas?Also, we found several pieri ropae caterpillars - the small white butterfly? There are so many of these flying around the neighborhood - are they helpful in the suburban ecosystem in some way or are they mostly considered a pest? That is, should I feel bad destroying them?thanks!",
        "author":"The Question Asker"
      },
      {
        "response":"Also, there are many many black brown balls in the crotch of the brassicas. I don't know if they're eggs or larvae droppings. Either way, I can't get my finger down there to wipe them away. Should I hose them or would it be a problem for them to all end up in the soil?",
        "author":"The Question Asker"
      },
      {
        "response":"Many people have had luck with using neem oil -- go ahead and try that. Yes, it is a white or white\/yellow butterfly. My motto is live and let live but you don't need to share your vegetables. Control them on your brassicas and it should not be \"guilt inducing\", they have stepped over the line. Yes, you are right those little black balls are eggs. Lay some newspapers down under the plants and then wash those guys out of the brassica crotches, pick up the newspapers and discard in the garbage. Yes, I know you will have a wet, soppy mess but you do not want to just wash them off into the soil under your plants. Remember for next year \"an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure\". Row covers at the right time will keep the butterflies from laying eggs on your plants. Also remember birds love those tasty, fat, juicy caterpillars. Encourage birds to visit your yard with water sources, cover for perching and nesting. It is an eat or be eaten world in nature and you want to encourage the birds who are eating the guys who are eating your brassicas. Good luck hopefully you will be able to salvage some of crops.",

In the link that I am attaching the Extension publication states that wisteria requires full sunlight (at least6 hours), moist but well drained soils for it to bloom. It can be frustrating to wait. One thing not to do is prune the plant heavily in spring. This can remove flower buds. Your idea for fertilizing with phosphorus can help promote flower but be sure to use only what is recommended.

I have included a link to a webpage of some of the common spiders of California that you can check to see if any look closer, but it also could be something that is not included there. http:\/\/www.spiders.us\/species\/filter\/california\/ Of these, I think the grass spiders and barn funnel weaver would be ones that more likely wouldenterintohomes and buildings, although these are usually not quite the size of two quarters.So why are the spiders coming to your sink? They could be male spiders that have abandoned their webs and are wandering around seeking females with which to mate (usually happens during the summer and fall). The females usually stay with their web and make the males come to them. Wandering males frequently enter buildings and homes during their wanderings. Some of these could be female spiders that are also seeking better places to live because of the hot, dry, draught conditions. They are not coming up through the drain, but rather entering through cracks under your doors or around your windows.These types of spiders are mostly active at night, so that is when they are wandering around your apartment. So what does your dirty sink offer them that your clean sink doesn't? Most likely water. The draught in California doesn't affect just people, but spiders too. And the inside of your home can be just as dry, if not more so, than it is outside. Normally spiders get most of their liquids from the insects they eat. But wandering males seeking mates often don't eat. So a thirsty spider stumbling across even a little bit of water in your sink, might be inclined to hide there and enjoy the extra humidity. And it may be that once in the sink, the sides are too slippery for the spider to climb back out. When there are no dishes and the sink is clean, there is probably no standing water there to attract them and they are more likely to pass the sink by and thus not get stuck there. Since you didn't send a picture of the actual spiders you are seeing, it is possible these could be completelydifferent types of spiders. However,whatever they are,mybestinterpretationofthisisthatthey arefollowinga similar behavior of seeking out water.",

The stress may cause some suckering from the roots, which you'll want to remove. Even if you are able to prune back to lower limbs, the tree may or may not make it due to the high level of stress.If there are no healthy branches below the split in the trunk, peach wood is lovely for grilling!

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"It looks as if your tomato plant now has mildew. Tomatoes are very touchy when it comes to watering. They need consistent watering; too much or inconsistent watering can produce blossom end rot. Too little or again inconsistent watering can cause cracking and yellowing. Also the effects of over watering and the effects of under watering often look the same -- yellowing or browning of leaves.Mildew again occurs when watering is inconsistent and you have a stressed plant. It is unsightly but usually not deadly to the plant. My guess is from looking at the pictures you sent and now the mildew that your plant is having some root rot issues from overwatering or too moist a soil. I often think that self watering planters could also be called assisted suicide planters. If you get yourself a hydrometer (it measures the moisture in the soil) for $4.95 or whatever and use it to test your soil moisture you have much greater control over keeping your plants watered just right. Seeing that your question comes from LA county you should have great weather for growing tomatoes although I know you have had above average heat this summer. Don't want to get a hydrometer just stick your finger down as deep as it will go in the soil if the soil is moist don't water, if it is dry water. If you can even out your moisture levels your tomatoes should recover and produce. Once your plants are looking healthy again remember heavy feeders such as tomatoes may need additional fertilizer as the fertilizer in \"planting soil\" washes away over the summer with watering. DO NOT fertilize while they continue to appear stressed that will be an additional stresser. Good luck",

      {
        "response":"Hi --You're close in your diagnosis, but it looks like the problem here is the aphids, not any \"fungus\"!Aphids excrete a sticky substance, \"honeydew\", that in turn provides a desirable environment for various fungi that can take up residence on this goo.  These fungi are collectively known as \"sooty mold\", because most of them range from a light grey to black and look like soot as they accumulate on sticky leaves.  Even apart from any sooty mold, aphids are a messy lot.  They shed skins when molting on the way to adulthood (and in a large infestation, one finds aphids at all stages of their lifecycle), and the honeydew glues skins, dust and anything else that might otherwise blow off onto the leaves.  Some types are known as \"woolly\" aphids, which, as the name implies, produce waxy, threadlike filaments that add to the mess and lend a cottony or web-like appearance. Neither honeydew nor sooty mold damage plants, at least until they build up to where they're significantly blocking light and air to a leaf.  Aphids feed on plants by sucking juices, which most plants can tolerate to a limited extent.  The trick to aphid control to get ahead of these pests before infestation causes a sticky, cosmetic nuisance (on the plant or on surfaces below) or compromises plant health.  You don't say which Bonide product you are using (they make many, including fungicides, insecticides and combinations), but pesticides are typically unwarranted (and difficult to use effectively) for aphid control.  Your best friends here are the garden hose, natural predators, and persistence; insecticides can do more harm than help by killing off the many predatory insects that consider aphids to be fine dining!  Your instincts are right in hosing off the mess; the persistence comes in as good monitoring and timely hose use to keep ahead of any build-up of bugs and their sticky mess.  Fungicides are not useful for sooty mold control.  Controlling the aphids will control the fungi because without honeydew to stick to, sooty mold won't take hold.Here's the University of California Integrated Pest Management program's fact sheet on aphids and their control:http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn7404.htmland on sooty molds:http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn74108.htmlAs for the slop on the concrete, you might find a quick scrub using dilute dish soap and a stiff-bristled deck brush will quickly disperse the otherwise stubborn film. Rinse well (and make sure soap is thoroughly dilute if rinsing into lawn or garden) and enjoy the luxury of clean soles!",

Digging into a plant ID from a good starting point makes the challenge more enjoyable, not to mention more likely to produce success.Alas, after several hours of digging, you still have this \"expert\" stumped!  I'm going to give you two resources to try, both in your area:First, the University of California Cooperative Extension in Plumas county has its own local Master Gardeners.  Their website has a \"what's that weed\" page: http:\/\/ucanr.edu\/sites\/mg-plumas-sierra\/Whats_that_Weed\/which has an email link (in the text under \"noxious weeds\") for assistance in weed identification. (There's another contact email and a phone number on their \"contact\" page, too).If they can't solve the mystery, you should try the folks California's Department of Food and Agriculture.  CDFA has a whole Center for Plant Pest Diagnostics, the duties of which include weed identification.   Here's the page for CPPD:http:\/\/www.cdfa.ca.gov\/plant\/PPD\/Be sure to tell the MG's and\/or CDFA that you did submit the question to eXtension, but we weren't able to make the identification.Plants that are neither attractive as garden specimens nor notably obnoxious (let alone truly noxious!) as weeds can be tough to identify. California has particularly good resources, and personnel, for weed identification due to potential harm in agriculture. In these cases, your local Cooperative Extension or state\/county Department of Agriculture offices are often best equipped to solve such mysteries.I don't come up empty-handed often, so please do let me know if you get an ID, by a follow-up to this question!! Thank you!(P.S., it sounds like you know your way around cultivated and not-so-cultivated vegetation, but... please don't go tasting berries from unidentified plants, especially when it's unclear even to which family they may belong!)",

    "question":"I have a pack of about 20 honeysuckle seeds Lonicera Periclymenum Graham Thomas that I got from Georgia Vines website. http:\/\/www.georgiavines.com\/cart\/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=9_20&amp;products_id=1030\nI followed their instructions to cold stratify in water then I put them on a wet napkin in a plastic bag, but they would not grow.

Keeping the seeds in something like moistperlite in the bottom drawer of the refrigerator should work well.How warm was the bag that they were placed in? 75 degrees should be a good temperature for germination. Lower than 65 and higher than 80 might inhibit germination.",

Prior to that, they were sharing a pot, so I thought the time was right to separate them. One is definitely the stronger of the two and is very healthy and happy in its new pot. The other, however, has begun to droop very badly. Once they were repotted, I gave them a good drink, but the pot that the droopy one is in has draining trouble. Its leaves aren't turning yellow, though, so I don't know if it got over-watered and is now drowning or what the problem might be. When I put a stick into the soil all the way to the bottom, it comes out a little muddy. Is my tree just stressed from all the water? Do I just need to wait for the soil to dry out?

Separating the two trees may have been difficult and some damage could have occurred. You are correct in your suggestion that a pot with poor drainage can hurt the young tree. If it stays too wet in the pot then then the roots cannot get oxygen out of the soil needed for it to survive. I would suggest planting it soon in your yard to see if it will survive.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"If the leaves have whitish\/gray spotting, that is likely powdery mildew. It is difficult to control without preventative chemistry. However, we can set you up for less of it in future years, perhaps. The lilac needs nearly full sun to minimize fungal growth. There will be more battles if it is in part-shade. If it is quite old, it can be pruned after flowering to promote air circulation between branches. This will also reduce fungal growth. Remove up to 1\/4 to 1\/3 of the largest trunks to open the bush a bit and encourage air and light penetration. The product you are using has some benefit, as would sulfur sprays. For non-organic control, a general purpose ornamental fungicide spray can help, too. Remember, organic and non-organic fungicides are mostly preventative, not curative, though.If this is not right, and you have black sticky mold on the leaves, you likely have aphids and those will need an insecticide to control. A good garden center can recommend one, organic or non-organic. They may also be able to help with disease ID if neither of my thoughts matches what you are seeing in the garden.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Yes, it very well could be the excessive heat. You say the plants are watered and mulched, and that is good. Three things to check:    1) You might want to check the actual root-ball to see if it is moist. It is possible that the root-ball is dry and when you irrigate the water will tend to skirt the outside of the plant and not wet the actual root ball. If the root ball is dry and repelling water, then irrigate with soapy water. Use 1 teaspoon liquid dish soap in a 2-gal sprinkler can and slowly irrigate each plant.    2) It is possible that you may have planted the Hebe plants too deep. Pull the mulch back and careful skim off a layer of soil  inch at a time until you see the uppermost lateral roots. The roots should not be any deeper than  inch. If so, the plants are too deep and may be smothering from lack of air. When you get the first cool snap, dig them up and replant at a higher level.   3) Are you irrigating too much? If so, root \"lock-up\" and root rot may be occurring. With a stick, probe down to the bottom of the root and then pull the stick out and check to see if it is too wet (like an oil dipstick). If so, reduce the amount of irrigation water and remove some of the mulch to allow the rootball to dry somewhat.  Take care, and good luck with this.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your question, very interesting.From the pictures the growth on the oak leaf is most likely a gall caused by a small wasp, a cynipid wasp probably. The majority of gall makers that attack oaks are wasps, but in some cases flies are responsible. Galls are caused by powerful plant growth regulating chemicals or other stimuli produced by the insect that react with the plant hormones. The majority of oak leaf galls do little or no harm to their host. However, twig galls may cause severe injury and bring about tree death. The galls you have in the pictures is a leaf gall.You can Google oak leaf galls to learn more. They are very fascinating.Hope this helps....",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"A second crop of flowers can happen in apples under some stresses. Drought is a common reason, so you may be seeing this. Depending on how you pruned, that may also have stressed the tree a bit and caused a flush of flowers. There probably is not time to get a crop from the flowers now, but you may see fruit developing. Also, remember summer pruning is mostly for disease and broken limb removal, the type of pruning that can be done any time. For the main pruning of apples for shape, light, and yield, do a late winter pruning prior to bud swell. If you want some more pruning tips, video sites have some great, short how-tos for \"apple pruning\" and maintenance.",

You say you also saw fecal droppings. The shape of the droppings are specific for each type of termite.  The drywood termite's fecal pellets are elongated football shape, with flattened and dimpled sides. The dampwood's feces do not have the flattened sides.I strongly suggest that you call a professional to sort this out.

The scientific name of this spider until recently was considered to be Larinoides sclopterius and much of the information you can find about it will still be listed under L. sclopterius. This species is distributed mainly in the Northeastern and Northwestern U.S., however, it may have originally been introduced from Europe where it also occurs. It has also recently been recorded from the Los Angeles area in California.It appears to be becoming much more widespread and common around homes and buildingsas I now receive frequent requests to identify them. These spidersare often found near water and originally probably lived on cliffs. However, they have substituted bridges and buildings as places to live. They do not spin their webs among vegetation, preferring the steel beams and eaves of man-made structures as their homes. The spiders usually hide during the day and come out onto their orb webs at night to capture prey. Lights on the bridges and buildings, and especially lighted windows attract many kinds of insects, especially those that emerge from lakes and rivers. Thus the bridges and buildings are perfect places for the spiders to live and find food. These types of spiders are not considered poisonous, nor prone to biting. One reference I found indicated that any bite would be somewhere between a mosquito bite and a bee sting in severity.  If you search the internet for bridge spider or Larinioides scolopterius, you can find more information and images of these spiders. I have included a link to a webpage that you can also quickly check out.  http:\/\/bugeric.blogspot.com\/2015\/02\/bridge-orbweaver-gray-cross-spider.html",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"It is possible that the container may be getting too small for your tree and that you are losing the soil nutrients and needed space for the growing tree. First look at why is it the tree has started losing branches and dying back. Is the pot too small? Is it not getting enough moisture? Then we can consider it may be a nutrient deficiency as to why you are losing the natural color of the the maple tree. Potting soils do not offer much nutrition for aging plants. Typically any fertilizers included in the bag are used within six months. You might need to repot the tree into a larger pot and blend in compost with your potting soil to add necessary nutrition. Then make a point to add more compost as a top dressing each year to offset what the tree uses.",

        "response":"This looks like mealybugs.  They tend to congregate at tight crotches, and when the population gets higher, they migrate to the leaves.  I would recommend stopping the fertilizer addition to help slow plant growth, as mealybugs thrive on succulent tissue.There is a chance that the plant had a few mealybugs at the time of purchase, or the mealybugs came from another plant.Here are some options for treatment, depending on what route you prefer: Placing the plant in a tub or shower stall and knocking them off with a brisk water spray (would have to repeat several times at 1 week apart)  Carefully wash plants with soapy water; one tablespoon of liquid dish detergent in one quart of water is a good ratio to use. Spray all your  houseplants with a registered insecticide; active ingredients include  azadirachtin, permethrin, pyrethrin, or acetamiprid. Usually  more than one application is required to get good control. Check with your local garden center for brand names",

      {
        "response":"The fruit grown above ground does not pose much risk is the irrigation water is not sprayed on the fruit. According to Carl J. Rosen, Extension Research Soil Scientist  at the University of Minnesota plants have only a limited lead uptake and do not accumulate lead so exposure through food is limited. http:\/\/www.extension.umn.edu\/garden\/yard-garden\/soils\/lead-in-home-garden\/. Dr. Rosen believes that exposure to the soil especially ingestion is a more serious problem. You do not mention how you irrigate. if you are sprinkling so the plants are covered with water containing lead then there will be a residue which should be removed by washing or peeling. You do not mention the amount of lead in your water and you may want to test it. Irrigating with this water will increase the lead levels already in the soil but that is a function of how often you water and how much lead is in the water. Lead is not very mobile in the soil and will accumulate in the surface soil and be resistant to leaching. Most of the information I could find on lead in the water was focused on drinking water where ingestion of the lead is the main concern. Here is a link to the US EPA website on lead in the drinking water.http:\/\/water.epa.gov\/drink\/info\/lead\/index.cfmThe main concern is where is the lead in your water coming from.",

        "response":"Mr. Villavicencio,Thank you for reaching out to eXtension regarding your invasive weed concern. Although I am not an invasive plant\/weed expert, your question was directed to me because I am based in the University of California Cooperative Extension office in San Diego. I forwarded your question to a couple of UCCE Advisors for help:Dr. Chery Wilen, UCCE Area Integrated Pest Management Advisor\/Interim Director, UC Statewide IPM Program and Dr. Chris McDonald, Natural Resources Advisor.Heres the information theyve shared. From the photos you sent, the weed is puncturevine, also known as goats head (Tribulus terrestris). It is a summer annual so it is dropping the seed heads now although even when the heads are on the plant they are still painful.  It thrives in areas with disturbed soil and low competition. It can be reduced in the middle of healthy vigorous turf, but still can be a problem in turf.Because it is an annual, preventing the seeds from maturing every year will reduce the population over time. There are herbicides but Dr. Wilen suggests you not bother with them this time of the year. Regardless, what is recommended you do now is pull all the plants you can (it is really easy to pull up) and then get the kids out there with old carpet scraps and put them top-side down on the places where the burs are, stamp down on them (the kids should like that) and that should get most of the burs.  You can also pick a lot of them up with a shop vac. For more information, there is a UC IPM management guide on puncturvine here:http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn74128.html. This pamphlet will give you more information on managing this weed. Keep in mind, if the ball field is located at a school, regulations stated in the Healthy Schools Act will need to be followed.If you have any further questions, feel free to contact me directly at jggonzales@ucanr.edu.Kind regards,",

Avoid over head watering. Especially keep open flowers with many petals dry. There are some fungicides to help prevent or reduce leaf, fruit and stem infections.

I washed them off, and then I applied an organic insecticidal soap to the leaves every 2 weeks or so. It has taken most of them out, although they do come back, but they are getting less and less.    So why is my plant drooping like this? Not enough sun? Too much sun? Water? Or are the tiny bugs killing it? I already had to cut off one large ear, because it started drooping and I came home to its stalk completely broken in half because it could no longer support the weight. This was about 3 weeks ago, and it had a mark on the leaf, most likely from the bugs. Now the tallest leaf is starting to bend down toward the ground. It seems to do well for a period, then another problem like this comes up. Is it making room for more leaves? I'm baffled.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Elephant ears are usually robust plants which are very hearty. They generally prefer to be outside with plenty of light in summer months and indoors in winter.  Sounds like you are aware to never allow the plant to dry out  they drink a lot of water as they naturally grow in wet areas, but it is possible to overwater. The most common pests you see on elephant ears are spider mites which love the texture of the elephant ear leaf, especially if you have it in a room where the air is very dry. Take a white paper towel and wipe the backside of the leaf. If you see black or reddish colored spots, you probably have mites. To get rid of the mites, try rinsing the plant thoroughly with a good blast of water, or following the label directions, treat with a specific miticide. If you haven't been fertilizing, you may have a nutrient problem. Since they grow so fast, they are also heavy feeders. They can be feed each time you water and respond well to foliar high nitrogen fertilizers. You said you have a sunny window  again because they are fast growers, they need lots of energy from photosynthesis. Provide as much light as possible. Insufficient light could be responsible for stems too weak to hold up the elephant ear leaves. The tear in your leaf looks more like the leaf being too heavy than like insect damage. You might also consider whether your pot is big enough. If you have had it for a while, you might consider repotting to give the roots more room.",

The first number is the nitrogen content, the second number is the phosphorus, and the third is potassium. The nitrogen is what is needed for leaf and stem growth so that should be your highest number. Yes, I agree that keeping it separate from your other plants until you can confirm\/treat for mites would probably be in the best interest of your other plants.",

        "response":"The splitting of some of your oranges should not be taken as an indicator of maturity. Fruit split is a stress response to soil moisture fluctuations. The maturity\/ripening of citrus has two major factors: decreased acidity and increased sugar content. While peel color often does not happen at the same time (i.e, green citrus may be mature internally), the sourness (acidity) that you are experiencing indicates that they are not fully mature. With additional time on the tree, the acidity should decline further and the sugar will increase. Citrus fruit store on the tree well, provided the tree is not experiencing drought conditions. The longer you can let them stay on the tree, the better they should get in eating quality---and color should come along in a few weeks too.",

First of all I would  encourage you to visit your local Master Gardener help desk to check on best timing for your climate, but the basic process is the same no matter where you are. Here isthe contactinfoforyourlocalExtensionoffice.  http:\/\/ucanr.edu\/sites\/RiversideMG\/ If you can, do this at least one season before you want to move your plant, perform some root pruning by taking a sharp square bladed shovel and cutting around your plant to be moved.  This will sever large roots and stimulate re-growth inside the area that will be moved with the ball of the plant.  Prepare your soil and planting area by making sure that your soil is lightly acid and moist.   Dig your plant up - you might break some branches in the process- being careful to try to keep a root ball intact. Move it to your new location and after settling it in place, prune away any broken branches back to a leaf node and water the soil thoroughly.  Hope this helps. Kirsten",

They both grow in close association and share nutrients and water to benefit each other. The earth balls produce large numbers of spores (the dusty mustard color material) and are spread by animals digging them up. They are not edible. There is not a really good way of getting rid of them, except to dig up like you have been doing. Some years you may see more than others, due to rainfall amounts.

      {
        "response":"Apparently, laryngotracheitis (ILT) can infect all ages, but typical clinical signs are most commonly observed in adult chickens. I am not sure why this is so as maternally-transferred antibody to offspring is apparently not protective to infection. It may be that at least in commercial operations younger birds are not exposed as early to the virus, and therefore clinical signs are less frequently seen, because they are raised separately from older chickens. Please refer to Diseases of Poultry 12th ed pp. 137-152 for a full overview of ILT.",

Jeffery pine, which I think you were perhaps too high to encounter, are often said to have a bark the smells like vanilla.... Here is a site where you can tune up your tree identification:  http:\/\/www.calforestfoundation.org\/Students-And-Teachers\/Students\/Know-Your-California-Trees!.htm The pines all have needles that come in packets, which you can see in one of your photos if your magnify it. Pines haveeither 2, 3, 5 or 7 depending on the specie.  Lodgepoles have two in each packet.  Other conifers have individual needles attached directly to the branch.  Spruce trees feel poky and sharp when you grab the needs, and firs feel soft (like fur). In the Rockies there is apparently another subspecie which rows in thick stands, so that the trunks make very good poles.  These are the trees that have been affect by bark beetles, die and burn in catastrophic wildfires. Here are some photos of stands of lodgepole in the Sierra Nevada.    If you were high enough, you could have also encountered bristlecone (foxtail) pines as well. http:\/\/www.fs.fed.us\/database\/feis\/plants\/tree\/pinbal\/all.html Hope that helps....",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The spider in your photo is a type of jumping spider in the family Salticidae. I cannot be certain from just the photo, but I believe this is the species with the scientific name Messua limbata. This species is found along the southwestern US border and inMexico. They are usually found on the ground, in grassy areas, meadows agricultural crops, or in low vegetation in woodlands. The females of this speciesare iridescent golden\/greenish colored with a darker cephalothorax (front part of the body) like in your photo. The males are darker with green iridescence and white stripes. Jumping spiders don't spin webs to capture prey. Rather, they wander around and jump or pounce upon their prey when they find it. They have greatly enlarged front eyes which help them locate and home in on their insect prey. All spiders have venom that they inject to subdue and digest their prey.The venom of jumping spiders, like most kinds of spiders, has little effect on humans.Jumping spiders are very docile and seldom bite, but if one did bite a person, it usually would be no worse than a mild bee sting.Because jumping spiders see so well, and can jump, they are very adept at avoiding contact with humans.

Thank you in advance for any clarification.\n\nLisa K",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Plant Cuttings:  Allow cuttings to harden off for about one week before  planting.  Plant cuttings in a clean dry potting soil mixture.  It is  recommended that the best potting mix is 3 parts commercial potting soil  and 1 part small to medium pumice.   If pumice is not available, use  bark chips or perlite.  The soil must hold moisture but drain quickly.    Plant cutting upside down for best results.  Plant the small growing end  1 to 2 inches deep in the soil.  Two (and only two) of the leaf  serrations should be below the soil level.  Place the pot in a bright  shaded place.  Rooted cuttings should not be allowed to dry out.  Water  lightly at first and then water once a week.  The only exception is in  the winter months when the cactus \"rests\".  Water during this time about  once a month.    Water Requirements: The rule in raising Epiphyllums is to not let the  roots completely dry out.  Allow the top 1\/3 of the soil to dry out  before watering.  Overwatering is the greatest danger in raising these  cacti.    Orchid cacti have natural growth cycles during spring and fall.  After  flowering, the plants may appear a little wilted but do not increase  watering more than the usual watering schedule.  During the winter, to  encourage heavy flowering next year, place cacti in unheated bedroom or  garage for 2 or 3 weeks.  Make certain they still receive filtered  light.    Light Requirements:  Cacti do best in filtered sunlight.  They seem to  like a few hours of full morning sun, but never full midday sun.  If  wintering your plants in the house, place them in a cool (40 plus  degrees F) room.  Lights should not be turned on after  daylight hours.   If lights are turned on after sundown, flowering for the following year  may be delayed or affected.    Watch your cacti for over\/under exposure to light.  Sunburned or  yellowish wilted growth means your plant is getting too much light.   Weak leggy growth means your plant is not getting enough light.  Fresh  green growth, (light to dark green) with slightly red edges indicates  that the plant is getting the right amount of light.    Temperature:  Epiphyllums like 40 to 90 degrees F. during the summer.  Plants subjected to 32 degrees F. and below die back.    Fertilizing:  A balanced fertilizer (10-10-10) should be used.  Do not  use a fertilizer that has a nitrogen content of over 10%.  To encourage  flower development, use 2-10-10 the last week of February and again at  the end of October.    Plant Pests:  These plants suffer very little from plant pests.  Fungus  gnats may be a problem.  If slugs or snails can get to these plants they  can do a lot of damage.    Epiphyllum Flowers:  Usually Epiphyllum must be root bound before they  will bloom.  This means their roots must fill the container before they  will produce blossoms.  If plants are in a 4 inch pot they will flower  faster than if grown in a 8 inch pot.  Flowering begins in late April  (white and yellows), May (pink and reds), June and July (deep reds and  purples).    Repotting Epiphyllums:  Plants should be repotted about every seven  years.  To repot, wait about a month after blooming.  Do not remove all  the soil around the root ball.  Just gently shake off excess soil and  then repot in fresh soil.  Do not water repotted plant for a week.   Water lightly for a month before returning to regular watering schedule.",

        "response":"There are many reasons plants die. One of the main reasons established plants die is because of a change in the environment, may it be appropriate watering or a change in the amount, application or fluctuation from the environment. It is always important to examine the rootsystem and hole of a dead tree. It takes time for trees to die and many times it is difficult for a home owner to recognize the symptoms of stress.If your dead trees showed a evidence of a healthy rootsystem, that was spreading out reaching into the native soil outside the planting hole and the soil is moist and not wet or dry you need to consider factors around the plant, like turfgrass and chemical applications.You may want to contact your local Cooperative Extension to discuss local diseases or if you soil needs to be tested. Here is the information for the Los Angeles Cooperative Extension. You may want to email them photos and what you find as you investigate and remove the dead tree. out. Email mglosangeleshelpline@ucdavis.eduwith a description of your concern or question. Attaching photos will help the Master Gardener diagnose the problem.

        "response":"Hello, And congrats on wanting to do something nice with your property. Even though I am in Virginia and the plants that I believe are pictured here are probably not the exact same plants that you would use in California to achieve this effect, I can still coach you a bit on how to use this photo as inspiration. First, notice the design and the flowing lines of the bed around the trees and how the multiple layers of the landscape set off the house in the background. I am going to try to convey to you why what you are looking at is so beautiful.  First. Notice the '3s'. Three trees. Three dormers. Three rows of plantings in the beds. Three round shrubs in foreground. Notice the wonderful lush health of the plantings. Water. Water. Right plant Right place. Choose plants that will grow well in your conditions.  Notice the transition and flow of the landscape from front of the house to the front of the yard. There is smooth line that your eye moves along that follows the edge of the hardscape to the edge of the lawn. Notice the transition of the layering from low perennials to shrubs to small trees to large trees and back down again at the house.  Notice the colors. Blues and cool pinks are soothing and calm inducing. There are no hot orange or red or other jarring accents that take away from the overall effect. Finally, notice the shape of the plantings. The trees arch up and over leading the eye back to the perennials the point upward in front of the soothing rounded shapes of the shrubs. There are many choices of plants that would create these effects of color, shape and form. If I was told that the photo was of plants growing here, in the foreground you have Nepeta sp. Catmint. It also could be dwarf Russian Sage or even one of the Salvia species. The roses are ubiquitous and while I wouldnotchoose the knockout rose another disease resistant varietywould be nice.Abelias would also provide similar flowering mounded shape as would many others.  Shrubs might be Japanese hollies, or boxwoods. Small tree looks like it could be a magnolia, with a flowering cherry to the right of house and large trees could be pecans, oaks, or a host of other large shade trees. Does this help?   Have fun.",

      {
        "response":"Glad to hear of your success and your zeal! The buds will take ten days or so to start flowering. The first flowers are usually male and do not make fruit. The plant makes female flowers starting a week or so later, assuring pollen from the male flowers is available. You can tell the difference by the miniature squash at the base of the female flowers. Bees or other insects are needed to move pollen from open male flowers to the female flowers. If bees are short in your area, you can do the same with a small artists brush; see this in various on line videos if you care to. Also, if you have not put fertilizer on since you planted, consider adding a bit again now to help the fruit and leaves grow for the next month or more. You should be harvesting squash in less than three weeks from that first open male flower!",

        "response":"OK. The lumber is not the problem. The TMV is carried from infected plants to non infected plants by nematodes and the nematodes in your soil have the virus. Treating the lumber is not going to have much effect since the nematodes do not feed on the lumber only living plants. The steam sterilization of the soil will kill the nematodes but cleaning the lumber will remove any soil and nematodes clinging to them. So cleaning and painting the lumber will only have a slight effect. You need to sterilize or replace the soil in the beds. The nematodes will live for several years without a host (living plant) as eggs hatch and die. Fumigation is used in commercial fields and steam sterilization is used in greenhouse settings. The are some mustard cover crops that are used for a more organic form of fumigation but these are not as successful as a gas, but should reduce the numbers and if you can grow non host plants in the beds for a couple years the nematode numbers will be greatly reduced.",

Can you give me more information?  Does it have a flower?  What does it look like?  Did you take the cutting from a larger mass of groundcover?  How tall does it grow in the mass?  How long\/thick are the leaves?   I would also encourage you to contact your local extension office and Master Gardener program who will be able to help you with your question.

        "response":"This is a plant that I'm unfamiliar with since I live and work in Kentucky. However, I am an arborist so I know about tree establishment. The amount to irrigate a newly transplanted tree\/shrubis going to vary based on soil, site, tree species, and mulch. Every newly transplanted tree should have mulch around its baseto keep the water you apply from evaporating and deterring weeds. And yes, the nursery was correct in saying that similar symptoms show up in the above-ground parts of the tree from bothunder- and over-watering.  All you can do is try to maybe apply more water than you have been if the soil does indeed seem dry. I read once these trees are established, they are very drought and heat tolerant. However, you may still be in plant establishment phase (which can sometimes last 3-5 years). Any tree is going to grow less in hard, compacted soil and therefore have less root mass as well. One information sheet I read about these trees say that the roots will seek out water soapplying water over a wider area may encourage a better, more dispersed root system. I'm not sure if this helped. Since you are in CA and don't go through a harsh winter like we do, it would be worth some continued TLC for the next several months. However, if stems snap instead of bend, they are dead and will not come back to life. Good luck!",

In other words, there is most likely a distinct difference in the two containers, either in the soil, the amount of water, or the ability of the one container to drain properly. If the soil in the affected container has been used for a year or two without cleaning, there could be an accumulation of salts in the soil on on the container. It also appears (from what we can see) that all of the plants in the container are suffering to some degree. This, too, suggests a problem with the soil in that container.

    "question":"Can Valencia orange trees be grown in the 3,300 elevation of Warner Springs ,C",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Citrus trees growing outside the Valley are at a distinct disadvantage with regard to climate, i.e., winter almost always will be accompanied by one or more freezes. Citrus trees are subtropical to tropical in nature; thus, they may suffer severe damage or even death because of freezing temperatures. However, several types of citrus have sufficient cold-hardiness to sustain some freezing conditions, particularly as mature trees. Valencia orange trees are classified as moderate in regard to cold hardiness. If you are willing to put forth the effort to provide cold protection for young trees, and sometimes even mature trees, you might be successful.   Several kinds of wraps are used on the trunk of young citrus in the belief that they will provide significant cold protection. With one exception, none provide more than a few degrees of protection to a young tree trunk. The wraps do prevent rodent damage and sprouts on the trunk, but they also may harbor insects, particularly ants, which can cause problems. The best cold protection possible for young citrus is a soil bank, which can be used for the first two to four winters.   Soil banks are put up around Thanksgiving and taken down about the first of March. A soil bank is a mound of soil piled as high as feasible around the trunk and lower scaffold limbs. Thus, the trunk and lower scaffolds will be protected from even the worst freeze, although the unprotected top may be killed completely. The tree will regrow from the trunk and scaffolds without going back to the rootstock.   Before banking, treat the bark to be covered with a suitable insecticide and a copper-based fungicide to preclude problems while the bank is up. Exercise extreme care in removing the banks to prevent damaging the bark, as it will be quite tender from spending the winter underground. Use the garden hose to wash off the last of the soil. If there is not enough soil from around the tree to build a good bank, borrow from the garden or use potting soil. The extra soil should be taken away    All citrus trees require deep soil having both good surface and internal drainage. Surface drainage refers to runoff to prevent water standing around the tree. Internal drainage is the ability for water to percolate downward through the soil to preclude saturation of the root zone.   The presence of vigorous, healthy landscape trees is a good indication that the soil is sufficiently deep and well-drained for citrus trees. Should uncertainty about internal drainage exist, dig a posthole 3 to 4 feet deep and fill it with water. All water should drain from the hole within 24 to 36 hours. Soils requiring more than 48 hours to drain completely should be avoided unless raised planting beds are used.   Most citrus grows well in a soil pH range from 6 to 8. Avoid soils that have high caliche content or are excessively salty, as citrus trees will not grow well in such soils. Hope this helps.",

Meteoric waters passing through and adjacent to large cooling magma bodies, like the Sierra batholith, pick up metals which are then deposited out in neighboring formations. Gold, silver, lead and mercury are just a few of the metals disseminated through the rocks. There are other methods of mineralization that also condense the metals into ore bodies.

        "response":"Hello, Here is some information from the experts in the horticulture field on Olive culture. in California. Here where we deal with most ornamental , non agriculture questions related to verticillium, the standard advice is do not plant verticillium susceptible plants inan area where this pathogenhas been confirmed.  Olive Verticillium Wilt Pathogen: Verticillium dahliae  (Reviewed 3\/14, updated 3\/14)  In this Guideline:                Symptoms and signs Comments on the disease Management                                              Publication Glossary               Symptoms and SignsSymptoms of Verticillium wilt appear when leaves on one or more branches of the tree suddenly wilt early in the growing season; this process intensifies as the season progresses. Death of mature trees infected with Verticillium is possible. Darkening of xylem tissue, a key symptom for distinguishing Verticillium wilt in many crops is frequently not apparent in olives.         Comments on the DiseaseThe fungus survives from season to season in the soil and probably in the roots of infected trees. In early summer the fungus can be readily isolated from diseased tissue in infected trees. Verticillium wilt tends to be most troublesome in the southern San Joaquin Valley. Some trees recover naturally from an initial infection, but others may die. This mostly depends on the strain of the fungus (defoliating or non-defoliating), the resistance of the cultivar, and the amount of inoculum in the soil.         ManagementThe most effective management strategies to protect trees from Verticillium wilt are those taken before planting. When considering a new site for an olive grove, avoid land that has been planted for a number of years to crops that are highly susceptible to Verticillium wilt, such as cotton, cucurbits, eggplant, peppers, potato, or tomato. The Verticillium wilt pathogen is usually present in these soils. Soils containing over one microsclerotia per gram of soil should be avoided.  Inoculum levels can be reduced before planting by flooding the fields during summer, growing several seasons of grass cover crops (especially rye or sudangrass) or a combination of these treatments. It is unknown if these techniques decrease inoculum levels to result in significant disease reduction.  Verticillium microsclerotia (fungal survival structures) have been documented to survive for at least 30 years in the soil. When replanting in an area where susceptible perennials were previously grown, remove as many roots of the trees or vines as possible. A resistant rootstock is not available; however some cultivars (Frantoio, Empeltre, and to a lesser extent Koroneiki) have exhibited tolerance to the pathogen (the pathogen can reproduce on the rootstock, but growth and fruit production are not affected by the disease). Use of a Verticillium-tolerant rootstock may not protect the scion, because the pathogen may grow through the graft union. Some tolerance has been reported in the table olive cultivars Ascolano and Kalamon (Kalamata).  After trees have been planted, there is no reliable method of control. Postplant soil solarization has provided inconsistent control in established plantings. Soil SolarizationBeginning in late spring, cover the surface of an entire block with transparent plastic that has a UV-inhibitor additive. Leave the plastic on throughout the summer and as long as practical. Inferior plastic will break down and render the treatment ineffective. Solarization gives inconsistent results when used in replant spots. For more information, see Soil Solarization: A Nonpesticidal Method for Controlling Diseases, Nematodes, and Weeds.",

You could try pruning down to that part of the trunk which has bark remaining around the entire circumference. If it sends up a strong sprout from that scion wood (the good plum variety) above the graft, you will get the plum variety you want. However, any sprouts from below the graft will be a different variety selected for cold and disease tolerance and not the fruit quality. It may be difficult to tell what you're getting.Unless you want to take that slim chance of success, we'd recommend replanting in the spring.

Perhaps I could make everything up without the eggs, and then beat them well and join the mixtures in the morning just prior to filling and baking pies.

      {
        "response":"Hi, I'm sure that you have eaten the turkey breast by now, but thought I should send an answer anyway. The reason for leaving the wrapping on is to prevent cross contamination in the kitchen. Having the turkey out of the refrigerator for 40 minutes would not be a safety issue. I don't know if you are aware of this or not, but turkey breast (or even a whole turkey) can be cooked from the frozen state. Just allow extra cooking time. For a fully frozen turkey, allow 1.5 times the normal cooking time. Hopefully this answers your questions. If not, please don't hesitate to contact us with further questions.",

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. I can't say for sure what's causing the issue with your snake's ventral scales. It could be the beginning of scale rot, which can occur in many species of snakes, including boas and pythons, and is caused by a variety of conditions. Scale rot is one of those terms that covers a range of problems. It can be caused if the humidity level is too high for a specific species or if cage conditions are damp for extended periods of time. Scale rot has also been applied to conditions resulting from burns and infections following skin abrasions or injuries.I recommend you take your snake to a reptile vet and let them examine it. They will be able to tell you if the condition is cause for concern, and, if so, how to treat it.Hope this helps, and thank you for using Ask an Expert.Jim",

What is your watering regime like during the hot days? Watering a little bit at a time will help to minimize water stress, which may have led to the sunburned fruit.

      {
        "response":"You are right - chickens do NOT urinate through their skin. In fact, they don't sweat either, since they don't have sweat glands. The by-product of protein metabolism in mammals is urea, which is water soluble and released in the liquid we call urine. In birds, the by-product of protein metabolism is uric acid which is not water soluble. Instead, uric acid crystals are deposited on the fecal material when they defecate. So you can look at chicken poo and see white on it - that white is uric acid crystals which is the bird's version of pee.",

      {
        "response":"Mike, If in full sun, I would consider soil sterilization of your artificial turf area once daytime temperatures warm above 70 or so. Learn more here: http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn74145.html This will kill weeds that have already germinated as well as un-germinated seeds. In the meantime, herbicides will certainly work. I would also look to identify the source of the weed seeds; were they under the turf when installed, or have they blown in from an adjacent area? If under the turf then I would guess the turf has started to break down, letting in light. What was the estimated lifespan of your artificial turf? It may need to be replaced. Learn about herbicides here: http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn74113.html You may consider nonselective and reduced-risk herbicides such as plant-based oils and soaps.

Different from a wolf spider or jumping spider, for instance, which hunt for their prey and rarely if ever spin a web.Looking at the underside of the spider, I cannot tell you the species, but it looks like Argiope aurantia.

I understand FDA allows 0.5 ppm to 2.0 ppm (500 to 2000 ppB) arsenic in certain foods, well above 76 ppB.

Infection in the spring is caused by spores (conidia), which develop from the overwintering fungus. There is little chance that the fungus will grow from the soil into the pot. In the spring, Botrytis infects young green tissues or blossoms. The disease requires warm moist conditions for infection. Fruit rots are relatively rare. There is not enough information in your post for me to know if growing your blueberries in pots will break this cycle. Are you propagating cuttings?",

It would also help to know what varieties you are currently growing or have grown in order to help determine what would be \"new\" to you and what might grow well based on experience with other varieties. Generally variety selection is driven by the market (the brewer) combined with agronomic factors (e.g. disease resistance, yield)It would also be important to know at what scale you are growing and whether certain brewing qualities are equally or more important to you then yield.One factor you are probably already keenly aware of is that this crop requires significant amounts of water to grow well.  It appears as though you have fairly arid conditions which helps with regard to common hop plant pathogens (e.g. mildews), but to support strong growth and ultimately good yields, water and nutrients are necessary.The UVM Extension Northwest Crops and Soils Hops Page (http:\/\/www.uvm.edu\/extension\/cropsoil\/hops) has results from recent variety trials (done in the Northeast USA).  I am not sure of any work being done in a climate similar to yours, although work in the Pacific NW may be relevant (Yakima and Williamette Valleys).",

Or was it a ball and burlap tree?4. Was this tree regularly watered? Is it possible that it was perhaps OVER-watered? Is the tree located in a lawn that is regularly irrigated?5. Did you apply any fertilizers to this tree at or following planting? Did you incorporate any compost, manure or other amendments IN the hole at planting?I will be better able to answer your question after I get your responses to these questions - and a photo.Thanks,Tony",

        "response":"Redwood trees typically consume large quantities of water. Where there is no fog, they have to use groundwater. As urban areas reduced overall watering and runoff that eventually went into the, there was less groundwater available for trees. Many urban trees have been affected and some have died from drought. You should estimate what percentage of the total crown is dead (10%, 50%, 80%), if it is mainly the top, if it branches scattered up and down, etc. and take some pictures before you consult a professional arborist.You may want to do some deep watering of the trees to see if the upper foliage can be recharged. Redwoods do 'resprout' from the base when they die, but they also can have shoots when they are not dead. You would probably be wise to consult a local arborist as they have now gained a lot of experience with situations such as yours. If your redwood tree does die, one good thing is they are very rot resistant and are not as likely to immediately fail as some other species.",

I will try to present both sides of the issues and give you enough info for you to be able to make your own decision.Advantages of hay nets: reduces hay waste and expense; allows close monitoring of appetite and intake; can tightly control amount fed; can use hay nets with small openings to keep horses busy longer so they are less bored; reduces ingestion of dirty (i.e. manure contaminated) hay and therefore certain parasite eggs. Horses with hay nets are probably LESS apt to choke on hay because their rate of hay intake will be slowed down significantly.Disadvantages of hay nets: danger of entanglement and injury especially for horses that are unattended for long periods; dust and debris can more easily get in horse's eyes and respiratory tract; tough material of hay net can injure lips and gums; \"unnatural\" angle for head and neck for eating (though this may not have any consequences); may not provide enough hay for horses left unattended for long periods (though one could use more than one hay net). There you have it-- something to be said for both sides. I think a manger is a happy compromise: less hay waste than feeding on the floor, a more natural eating angle, and no danger of getting tangled up in a hay net.Best wishes,",

It could be a leaf-feeding caterpillar or a weevil (both cause similar damage). Silk strands and small droppings will sometimes be seen when caterpillars are present. I suggest you reach out to your county's UCCE Master Gardener Help Desk program. They may have seen similar pest damage on gardenias.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi,You may begin to see mold forming in a pile indoors before moving it out the the compost pile. The mold itself is actually the natural decomposition of materials taking place so it would not negatively impact the compost pile as long as you are keeping the proper mixture of dry brown matter (leaves, shredded paper, straw, etc) to the green kitchen waste. You are probably more concerned with the smells and attraction of fruit flies to the indoor collection. A good airtight container emptied every few days should prevent these problems. I use a large rubber maid type container that has snap down sides and a rubber gasket and have never noticed any smells. You can also keep this container in your refrigerator to further slow down the molding process in the house.If you do not generate large enough quantities of food and yard waste to keep your pile active you may consider composting with worms (vermiculture). Vermicomposting can be done on a smaller scale indoors. Here is a great publication from the University of Maryland on how to do indoor composting with worms.https:\/\/extension.umd.edu\/sites\/default\/files\/_images\/programs\/hgic\/Publications\/HG40_Indoor_Redworm...",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I cannot be absolutely certain from just your photos, but I believe that the spider you found is a male of the false black widow, scientific name: Steatoda grossa, family: Theridiidae. False widows are related to the true \"venomous\" black widow spiders (genus: Latrodectus), and although the bites of the false black widow are considered \"medically significant\" because the symptoms may mimic those of the bite of a black widow, they are much less severe and not persistent. These spiders are very reluctant to bite, andthe most of the reported bites are usually not much worse than a bee sting. Bites usually come when spiders are roughly handled or pressed against the skin from tight clothing. False widows are generally shy and stay out of sight in secluded spaces where they build tangled webs. This is a common species in southern California, and they are often found in homes and other buildings, although seldom noticed, because they usually remain hidden under furniture, in closets, crawl spaces, sheds, and other dark secluded places. Your spider is a male, which has a smaller body and longer legs than the females, and they will wander around more as they seek females with which to mate. False widow spiders commonly prey on pillbugs and sowbugs, but also eatother spiders, including true black widows. Thus, if you are finding false widow spiders around your premises, it is less likely that you will also have black widows. I have included some links below to websites with more information about these spiders. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Steatoda_grossa http:\/\/ento.psu.edu\/extension\/factsheets\/false-black-widow http:\/\/www.spiders.us\/species\/steatoda-grossa\/",

My best guess is that this is an immaturetarantula in the genus Aphonopelma (family: Theraphosidae), several species of which occur in southern California. However, I can't exclude the possibility that this might be some kind of wolf spider in the family Lycosidae. Without clearer, close-up photos or the actual spider, that is the best I can do for now. If you can send me some additional sharp, close-up photos, perhaps I can determine it one way or the other. Otherwise, you may need to take the actual specimen to your county extension office to see if they have a spider expert they can forward it to in California. Another possibility would be to take it to one of the natural history museums in your area, or the Entomology Department at UC Riverside.",

You may want to clean a couple of leaves now to get the photosynthesizing going again and then treat it with the Neem Oil. Wait a couple of day and clean more leaves off. Follow the directions for sooty mold and mites. You must repot this Croton. I don't know if the plant is root bound but the soil is old and should be remove. In your case, I would remove ALL of the soil and gently run room temperature water over the roots to clean them of the old soil and any possible eggs hiding next to the roots--something is causing the black spots. Put your plant into a pot NO BIGGER than 2 inches larger than what it is in now. Remember, Crotons need bright light, fertilizer and even water habits.

It is very disturbing for children especially one of this young age who does not understand what is occurring.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello,Thanks so much for submitting your question. There could be a few different things happening with your seeds. Your seeds might have dried out accidentally. The soil should be kept consistently moist during the germination period. When you are first adding soil to your containers be sure that is throughly moist before you add it to the container, but not sopping wet. When you squeeze a handful of it you want about 1-2 drops of water to trickle out. One trick I use is to put saran wrap over the seeds while they are germinating. That helps to preserve the moisture. Then I use a spray bottle to mist the top of the soil, so I'm not washing the seeds out of the pot with a watering can before they germinate. Also be sure to germinate the seeds in the dark, and then move them to the light right when they start poking through the soil. You may also want to check the date on your seed packet. They might be old seeds, or they have a low germination rate due to improper temperature storage. Humidity can shorten a seeds life. One great way to test seeds is to put 10 seeds inside a moist paper towel and put the towel in a sealed zip lock bag in a warm location. Check the seeds periodically to see how many of the 10 start to germinate. If only 1 or 2 germinate then your rate of germination is only 10-20% for those seeds. It's also helpful to have some heat on the bottom of tomatoes if you are germinating them indoors. A seedling heat meat that plugs into the wall works great and is easy to use. Tomatoes also take 5-6 days on average to germinate. Hope this helps! Good luck with your tomatoes.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi,It appears that you tree has either suffered from a physical injury that has caused the bark to come off, or a canker disease causing this. Either way, once the bark begins to peel the vascular system of the tree loses some of its functionality and the tree is less able to conduct water and nutrients through the stem. The dieback you have seen is symptomatic of that.There is really not much you can do other than give the tree good care and se e how it fares through the coming growing season. If the canker\/injury is on a branch (but it looks like a main stem in the photo so this may not be practical), you can prune out the injured branch and you may see some recovery. You can also contact your local County Extension Office for more information on growing loquat trees in your area: 626-586-1971. ",

    "title-question":"What kind of bites are these? Mosquito? Bed Bugs? Fleas? HELP! So I am trying to figure out if I have bed bugs or I got bit by mosquitoes or what. So I started just wearing a tshirt to bed. No underwear or pants. And recently I noticed some bites on me. two on my left lower stomach ( about an inch and a half apart, two in my inner left thigh about an inch apart, and two on my upper left thigh (about 4 inches from the ones in my inner thigh). They are all about the size of a pencil eraser except one of the ones on my stomach is a little bigger. All have the small dot in the middle from the bite site. It wasn't until I started itching them that I saw them that I noticed them and they are now red. From what I have read, bed bug bites are normally formed in a straight line. Every weekend I stay at my friend's house and she has a dog. Who knows maybe he picked up fleas. Also at her house I wear shorts to bed that can ride up and if my shirt rides up as well, these places may become exposed. I checked my mattress, mattress pad, and box spring and saw no bugs, exoskeletons, rusty smears suggesting feces or any dark spots other then specks of fuzz here or there. I just vacuumed, washed all my sheets and pillow cases and clothes because I got freaked out. None on my pillows either had anything on them either.

        "response":"Hello,Bed bug bites cannot usually be identified by bites alone, as they look similar to mosquito and spider bites. Signs of a bed bug infestation include dark spots on bedding, eggs and eggshells (which are about 1mm across and white), and rusty or reddish stains on sheets caused by crushed bugs. When not feeding, bed bugs can be found near the piping, seams and tags of mattresses, and in cracks in the bed frame and headboard.    Flea bites generally result in the formation of a slightly raised, swollen itching spot with a single puncture point at the center (similar to a mosquito bite). The bites often appear in clusters or lines of two bites, and can remain itchy and inflamed for up to several weeks afterwards.   Although, one can not say for sure by picture alone, I suspect you have flea bites. Good luck. A",

      {
        "response":"Hello Sandy,You are correct in thinking this is a fungus. It is the fruiting structure of a fungus feeding on the organic matter, probably the woody roots of your tree, underground. The fungus is a decomposer, doing its job breaking down the dead wood in the soil. When the fungus is happy, has the correct moisture and temperature, it sends up 'mushrooms' as its reproductive material. Spores will be released from the growth to hopefully land on suitable host material and continue the cycle. If you do not like the growths, just shovel them off to the compost or garbage. Do not let your animals eat them as they could be toxic.Regards,Carol Quish",

    "question":"I bought a meyer lemon and a lime tree.  I removed the tabs and now can't remember which is the lemon or lime.   How can I tell which is which?  I have included a picture of one of the trees.  Which tree is this",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi! Examine the size of the tree. Generally, lime trees are smaller than lemon trees. Lime trees grow to be 6 to 13 feet tall. Lemon trees, on the other hand, will grow to be 10 to 20 feet tall.  Look at the leaves. When the flowers are in bloom, the flowers of a lemon tree will have purple blush, while the flowers of a lime tree have white blush. Also, most lemon tree leaves will be larger in size than lime trees, ranging from 4 to 5 inches in length. Most lime tree leaves are no more than 3 inches long.  Smell a leaf. When torn, lemon leafs have a mild scent. Lime tree leaves, however, have a strong lime scent that immediately identifies the tree.  Smell a sample of the tree bark. Carefully break off a leaf and smell the exposed bark underneath. The bark of a lemon tree has no perceptible scent, while the bark of a lime tree has a very strong lime scent.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Although your photos become blurry when I try to enlarge them to see details, I am still fairly certain that the spider in your photos is a male western black widow spider, scientific name: Latrodectus hesperus, in the family Theridiidae. I can tell this is a male by the large bulbous structures on the palps at the front of cephalothroax (head), which the male uses for mating. The white striping on the abdomen is fairly typical for the males of this species, although sometimes the stripes may also be reddish. In the males especially, the normally red hourglass mark on the underside of the abdomen may be yellow or white, which matches your description of \"white on the bottom\".Males also have smaller, narrower abdomensthan the females. The female black widow has the more venomous bite, due to extremely large venom glands.However,male black widows have very tiny venom glands, such that any bite from a male is generally considered harmless. Black widows are very shy and retiring, and very reluctant to bite, so bitestohumansare actually very rare. And although bites from these these spidersare considered medically significant and often require medical treatment,there are actually very few deaths attributed to black widow bites, and those have most often occurred with very young children or very old people whose immune systems are as not well developed. I have included below some links to websites with more photos and information about these spiders. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latrodectus_hesperus http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/1001377\/bgimage",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Daryl, Your question was first assigned as a plant identification request but was later assigned to me as a potential insect identification request. I am not a botanist, but after doing a little searching on the web, I think your plant might be an indigo bush, possibly the Mojave indigo bush, Psorothamnus arborescens , but you would need a plant expert to confirm that. However, I am an entomologist, and I believe that your little 'ball of rocks' is possibly the case of a type of bagworm. Bagworms are the caterpillars of moths in the family Psychidae. As their name implies, the caterpillars make silken cases or bags which they carry around with them and in which they hide. The cases are adorned on the outside with bits of plant matter, sand,and other types of debris to help camouflage them. Most of the bagworms I am familiar with cover their cases with bits of leaves or twigs from the plants they feed on. Some cover their cases in sand or dirt. I am not familiar with any that use larger bits of rocks, but I could see that as a possibility in the desert. From you photos, you can see how well they blend in to the background. The caterpillar hides most of is body inside the case with only the head end sticking out to move around and feed. However, the caterpillar can withdraw the head end inside also, while still holding securely to the substrate, thus offering itself fairly complete protection. The 'case' in your photos appears shorter and broader than would be normal for the caterpillar and seems securely attached to the branch, so this is possibly now serving as a pupal case inside which the caterpillar is transforming into the adult moth. I searched through my resources and could not find a specific type of bagworm that makes this type of case using rocks, but some will use whatever resources they have on hand. It is possible this is something else, but based only on your photos, my best guess is still a bagworm, or at leastsome other type of insect case or cocoon. I have attached a link below to a website with more information about bagworms.  https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bagworm_moth",

The tree has stayed this way for several months now. My friend who lives about 30 miles from me has 5 birch trees. Only one of them died (looks the same as mine) but the others are healthy. I don't see any kind of burrowing holes so I don't think it's insects. But here in So. Calif. I've had to cut my watering back. Could that be it? It was a beautiful tree and makes me sad that it's now gone",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Birch trees are plants that need moist soils to survive. Extended droughts can weaken this tree severely. Once weakened they are susceptible to other problems such as borers that can feed under the bark damaging the vascular system. The University of California list them as short lived species in areas with hot dry conditions. When a tree does not go through its normal fall color anddoes notdrop leaves it indicates a plant that is in severe decline. I cannot say for sure but a severe drought is the likely cause.",

      {
        "response":"Hello,The occurrence of white fungal in your raised bed may indicate that the soil is too wet. Either water less frequently but longer to stimulate deeper roots or amend the soil by adding sand or perlite to allow better draining. Try not to over water and allow for the soil to dry (between moist and dry) before re-watering.Without a photo and sample it will be hard to determine if the mold is harmful to your plants. Fortunately, most fungi are naturally occurring and are beneficial for the health of the soil and to other plants. The fungi help with the breakdown of organic material which in turn result in nutrients available for plant up take. If in doubt, one can remove the infused soil and replace with fresh garden soil. Hope this helps, have a great time gardening!",

    "question":"Is there a safe way to distroy them besides fire and bug sprays",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I would certainly NOT suggest using fire to destroy spider eggs sacs unless they had been removed from the vicinity of homes and buildings and any other materials that might possibly catch on fire.If you see spider egg sacs hanging from webbing, simply take a long stick or branch, reach in and move the stick around to wrap the webbing and egg sacsaround the end ofthe stick. They can then be pulled out of their hiding place and placed into the garbage, submerged in water, tossed into a field, or otherwise disposedof (even burned if you have a safe fire pit, fire place or barbeque).Most garden and household insects sprays labeled for controlling spiders shouldalso be effective if you can thoroughly wet down the egg sac with the spray. Light mists may not penetrate through the silk of the egg sac to kill the baby spiders or eggs inside.Even then, if they are in the open, you may need to use the stick\/branch routine to remove them after they have been sprayed.  However, unless you have a deathly fear of spiders, I would not recommend removing outdoor spider eggs sacs at all unless you knew that they belonged to a harmful species such as a black widow. The vast majority of spiders are completely harmless to humans, and they are actually beneficial to have around because they will capture and eat many of the pest insects that may be more of a problem around your home and garden. And they are very likely to return to the places you are seeing their webs and egg sacs anyway, because those are obviouslyideal places to capture prey and raise their babies or else they wouldn't be there to begin with. If you do have a deathly fear of spiders, you may need to hire a professional exterminatorto treat around your home where you are seeing the spiders or their eggs, but even then it is difficult to keep them away entirely.

        "author":"The Question Asker"
      },
      {
        "response":"As my colleague suggested, we can't identify the spiders or confirm that they are indeed black or brown widows without at least a photo. They could easily be many other types of spiders. Regardless of whether they are widows or not, theimportant thing for you is how to get rid of them.Again I do not recommend burning them with fire as you previously asked. And you probably have too many of them to justscoop up the webs and egg masses with sticks or branches.In your situation, insecticide sprays should be the best solution, since you also have adult spiders present. Most yard and garden insecticides as well as many household sprays available from home improvement or yard and garden stores will kill the spiders and any babies that hatch. Just direct the sprays under the rims of your planters, under the tables, and patio, and anywhere else you see the webs, spiders and eggs sacs. This should kill most of them and prevent them from coming back for at least a while. However, these insecticide sprays break downand lose effectivenessover a period of time, and the spiders will likely eventually return from surrounding areas since your yard seems to be ideal habitat for them.Thus, you will likely have torepeat the sprays every few monthsto keep the spider populations from building up again. If you are uncomfortable with doing the spraying yourself, I would recommend contracting witha certifiedpest control company to treat your yardand around your home. ",

        "response":"Hi, The image of the fruiting shoot definitely appears to be fireblight but the random blackening of leaves on the tree is not typical, unless the entire tree is dying. Organic management of fruit trees can be a bit challenging and really starts with variety selection on resistance. The D'anjou is one of the more highly susceptible varieties to fireblight. Highly Resistant varieties include: Honeysweet, Kieffer, LaConte, Magness, Moonglow, and Old Home. Seckel, and Maxine are classified as Resistant. It may be worth doing a soil test to see where your nutrient levels are. Avoid over-fertilization and severe pruning as lush new growth is more susceptible to infection from fireblight and other diseases. Pruning out infected tissue 4-6\" below infection and sanitizing sheers after each cut would be the immediate control measure to ensure it does not continue to spread down the tree. Bag all plant matter and dispose. Copper based fungicides can be used in dormancy prior to bud break. Copper and\/or streptomycin can be used to protect new growth until petal fall.",

        "response":"Hi!That is a lot of stress for the ficus benjamina, They are typically very picky plants. It may have been more stress than they could handle at one time. A good way to see if they are still alive is to take your finger or thumbnail and scrape away at the branches. If you see green under the bark, they are still alive. If not, they are most likely dead. If still alive, keep them watered, but do not overwater them. Make sure there is good drainage in the pot, so if they are overwatered, the excess water can come out the bottom. You may also want to give them a little bit of fertilizer. Make sure to read the fertilizer label and do not apply more than what is recommended.  Hope this helps.",

All active ingredients are systemic, meaning they must be taken up by the plant before they will work. The insecticides should act quickly; the aphids should mostly die within one or two weeks. The fungicide is a protectant, meaning it will not improve existing black spot appearance but will prevent new infections and spread of existing infections. Please review these UC pest management guidelines for aphids and black spot on roses: http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn7404.html http:\/\/www.ipm.ucdavis.edu\/PMG\/GARDEN\/PLANTS\/DISEASES\/blackspot.html In the future, you may be able to tolerate some aphids since their populations always crash in summer. Black spot can be prevented nonchemically by ensuring good air circulation via pruning and by avoiding overhead irrigation.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"There are many reasons for a young grapevine to lose its leaves. Different varieties of grapes have different cold hardiness with some being able to withstand much colder temperatures than others. Adequate water in the ground is essential and must be maintained all year, even in the winter, in order for the roots to stay healthy and nourish the plant. That doesn't mean to drench the soil and drown the plant, just keep it somewhat moist and don't let it dry out completely. There are also diseases and insects that can cause damage to the plants.It's not possible to determine the cause of the problem with your grapevines from the picture. They may survive or they might be gone. You can use a fingernail to scratch the bark on the vine to see if there is still any green under the bark. If so the plant stands a good chance of being okay over time. If not, I would still give it a few weeks to see if it recovers. Don't disturb these already stressed plants this spring. If you can possibly wait until fall to move them, they will have a better chance to recover. This publication gives additional information on cold injury to grapevines and you can contact your local office of Cooperative Extension to see if they accept samples of plants to diagnose problems with them. Your local office can be found at this website.Good luck with your plants. If you have additional questions on this subject, please use the reply feature within this email or contact your local office. And thanks for using Ask an Expert!",

Then the surrounding areas shown began to wilt. But I did no damage to them in my removal. You can see on the top of the wall wilt is intermingled with healthy leaves. There will be a long stem with healthy leaves along with wilting leaves. It makes no sense! I am an avid gardener and am so stumped. My gardener only prunes the small growth that extends into the planters and in no way touches the thick stems and roots that support the plant. But ironically he pruned and weeded the day this happened. I asked him and we investigated all stems and areas and can see no damage anywhere, especially to vital stems.

There is no specific common name assigned to this spider other than the general name for the family as \"wolf spiders\". This is a fairly common wolf spider that is found throughout much of the United States, but which is more common in the west. Wolf spiders do not build webs, but rather wander around over the ground seeking their prey. A few species, including some populations of Schizocosa mccooki, will dig and live in burrows, hiding during the day and coming out at night to seek prey. Despite their name and \"fearsome reputation\", wolf spiders are actually shy and not aggressive, preferring to flee from danger. Bites from wolf spiders are very rare and not considered to be medically significant, usually being not much worse than a bee sting. I have included some links below to websites with more information and photos of these spiders. http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/112889 https:\/\/bioweb.uwlax.edu\/bio203\/f2013\/kirchner_alex\/",

This is a standard set of rules by which public meetings are run, based on a book called Robert's Rules of Order. The words you are hearing, such as \"making a motion,\" \"aye\" or \"nay,'are a part ofthe process groups follow to discuss issues and make decisions. Thedegree to which groups use and follow Robert's Rulesdepends on how well the meeting leader and the group members know them.

        "response":"With so many different and unrelated plants showing the same symptoms, namely shriveling\/dying shoots &amp; tips, deformed leaves, and yellowing\/browning leaves - all this points mainly to chemical toxicity. While insects and diseases are selective in their ability to infest or infect plants, herbicide toxicity is \"across the board.\" The symptoms you've described sounds like herbicide damage that may have started4-6 weeks ago. Questions: 1) have you used a broadleaf weed killer in and around these plants; 2) have you used a weed &amp; feed turf product in your lawn that may have gotten into the root system of these plants; and 3) have you sprayed these plants with an insecticide or liquid fertilizer that may have been applied with a sprayer that held broadleaf weed killers and was not cleaned properly. Unfortunately, if the culprit is herbicide-related, not much can be done. If herbicide injury is suspected Do Not Apply a fertilizer. A fertilizer will cause a boost in growth, and a boost in more herbicide uptake which will cause more damage. Irrigation water or rainfall may help greatly to dilute the herbicide productproviding the area where these plants are located is not on a down-slope where runoff water may bring in more herbicide. Good luck! Hope this information is of some use. Feel free to respond.",

        "author":"The Question Asker"
      },
      {
        "response":"Interesting! Well the next best answer is high soil salinity (salt levels). Salts (sodium, chlorine, fluorine, etc) are considered salts and cause very similar symptoms as herbicide injury.     Since your plants show similar symptoms, I would doubt the problem is disease related.      Sucking insects such as aphids, spider mites, scale, mealy bugs, etc. do release toxins in addition to killing individual plant cells that result in cupping, twisting, and yellowing of the affected leaves. But, even insects will not share the host of plant types you've mentioned. However, it is common (for example) that different aphids infest different plants in the same landscape when environmental conditions are just right and at the same time.    Getting back to the soil issue - I would call your local county agent for a soil test bag and form, and have the soil tested for nutrient deficiencies and toxicities (cost ~$20). Since most all plants are showing the same general symptoms I would take 2 or 3 samples of soil from around each plant type and mix them together for one composite sample to send in for analysis.    Pay close attention to soil pH, soil salinity levels (sodium, chlorine, boron, magnesium), buffering capacity of the soil and the levels of micro-nutrients. Here is a link to a good publication: http:\/\/www.salinitymanagement.org\/Salinity%20Brochure.pdf .      When you receive your soil test results, it should be self-explanatory.  But, if you need help your local agent should be able to assist you.  And, here is a great publication that will help you understand what you are dealing with: http:\/\/www.spectrumanalytic.com\/support\/library\/pdf\/guide_to_interpreting_irrigation_water_analysis.pdf     One more thing- the irrigation water!  Just as in the case of soil salinity and nutrient toxicity, the same holds true for your irrigation water.  Your local water utility district should be running routine analysis on the water they provide.  Ask for a copy and compare pH levels and salt level with that of the soil test results.  If you are unsuccessful in obtaining a copy of the water test results, then talk to your county agent for a water test form and pay the fee (~$20) to have it tested yourself.      Good luck with all of this.",

        "response":"Thank you for your question. I am not an expert on the effects of wildfire on wildlife. If the snake was inside a cast iron oven when the wildfire came through the area, I imagine the extreme heat inside the oven and the lack of oxygen killed the snake very quickly. However, muscle contractions and nervous system activity probably account for the open mouth and posture of the body.Hope this helps and thank you for using Ask an Expert.Jim ",

There are several different species that occur in southern California, all of which look very similar, and I am unable to determine the species from just your photo. Jerusalem crickets are distantly related to grasshoppers and crickets, but they never have wings, don't jump and are different enough to be placed in their own family. These strange looking insects with large heads live in the drier habitats of the western US. They feed mostly on decaying plant matter, usually remaining hidden under rocks or logs during the day and venturing out at night to feed. They are generally harmless, but have large mandibles or jaws that could inflict a painful bite if they are carelessly handled.

        "response":"Dear Sir\/Madam Commercial sunflowers these days are hybrids and self compatible and therefore self pollinating. Sometimes bee hives are added to assist this process.   If you are seeing lines of both short and tall sunflowers in a block, this will be a seed production or crossing block where hybrid seed for a commercial cultivar is being produced.   The shorter males may be planted a bit earlier than the female lines to ensure plenty of pollen is available when the taller female single headed lines are flowering. The shorter male lines may be multi headed. Bee hives are often also present nearby to assist pollen transfer.   The female plants are male sterile ( no pollen)  and need the pollen from the male line to produce a seed.   This crossing process creates hybrid seed in the female head for planting commercially. The male plants will usually be cultivated out as soon as pollination of the females is complete.   The fertilised females stand alone in the field until maturity when they are harvested.

Pocket gophers are an ongoing problem and we try to control them in our garden area and around our home. I have killed many in my traps and am quite good at nailing them. Occasionally there is a critter that lives underground that gives me fits. It may not be a pocket gopher. Having never seen one, the only distinguishing features I can describe are their 'mine tailings'. This animal does not build typical mounds here and there and everywhere like a pocket gopher while digging tunnels and doing housekeeping. It pushes the spoils into one huge pile and closes the portal behind itself each time. After a while the tailings can be significant. I have a pump box that had a dirt floor. After removing a couple of wheelbarrows full of soil from the pump box several times, I 'rat proofed' it with some concrete. That solved the problem and the critter must have moved on. This animal shows no other evidence of existence; no other obvious openings or mounds except the one tailing point. But it moves so much soil that I fear a sink hole will appear one day that is big enough to swallow our car. When I am able to find the tunnel at the head of these piles of soil (not always easy), it is small and diameter like a gophers tunnel would be. And, it is packed solid as far back as a foot or more.

These mounds can be large enough that it would take several trips with a wheelbarrel to dispose of the dirt.  These sites are associated with more permanent portions of a burrow system, presumably leading to nesting chambers.  Tunnels associated with these mounds are often at a very steep angle, disappearing to pretty substantial depths quite rapidly.  This seems like the most likely explanation, but who knows.  There are also up to 3 species of moles in that area.  Could be that a different mole species might create a larger mound????

Some I call \"deepsters\" as their tunnels go down steep and deep and others I call \"shy\" because their burrow entrances are filled just flush with the ground.  The ones that are actively digging and making mounds are the easiest to trap.  I have better than an 80% kill rate on those.

A) The trees I have is one 30+ year old at 30+ feet tall; this tree has never been pruned. What would be my approach on this?  B) The 10 others cherry trees range from 5-10 years old and too have never been pruned, what about these?  C) And Root-Stocks &amp; Grafting help: Any branches I prune, I would like to graft them into root-stocks. But access to these root-stocks is a heavily guarded secret; I have placed many calls and performed hours of on-line searches, with no help\/success-any links lead to dead-ends (being unavailable). This much I know, there are about five common root-stocks that are used for cherry trees (Performer, Gisela 12, Gisela 6, Mahaleb, and Mazzard ), each one having advantage and disadvantages over the others. Tough choices with this, one must know everything about the disadvantages (i.e. diseases) and which ones are the most critical and the ones that are most easily dealt with.  Can you help here?  Thanks, Chri",

        "response":"Lots of Questions,Most pruning is done in the winter and early spring because it is easier to see the structure of the tree. Pruning a 30 year old tree that has never been pruned? What is your objective? Do you want to shorten the tree? How high are you going to pick? I would not recommend removing more than a third of the height of the tree in any one season. For the renovation of an old tree which has not been pruned for many years I recommend a three year process. Removing large limbs in the top of the tree the first year. Removing smaller limbs and crossovers and any limbs that are too close together the second. Then continuing to clean up the middle and top of the tree the third. If you try to do it all in one year you will be pruning out vigorous water sprouts for many years trying to settle the tree down to setting fruit on spurs rather than growing vigorous shoots. To shorten the tree. You can choose a limb to be the new top of the tree and remove the rest of the top. That will be a big cut and I would suggest painting the wound with a pruning compound or a diluted interior grade latex paint as soon as you can after the cut. For cuts smaller than a quarter you do not need to do that. You will get vigorous growth from these cuts and I would suggest removing all but the weakest shoot. I call this a vigor sink and you are forcing the growth into this branch rather than growing a lot of new shoots. The next dormant period you can keep or remove the one you left.You should probably open up the tree to allow more light penetration into the canopy. I assume this is a sweet cherry. Sweet cherries bear their fruit at the base of last years growth and on fruiting spurs on older wood. If those spurs are shaded they will be less fruitful and eventually die so that all the fruit is on the exterior of the tree. You do need to make some cuts in the top of the tree to promote flower bud formation and fruiting in the interior of the tree. Remove several large limbs from the top of the tree to allow light to penetrate into the interior of the tree.So the first year most of your cuts are made in the top of the tree. The second year, you should see some growth in the middle of the tree and this will help you decide which limbs to keep (ones that show growth) and which to remove. Remove any limbs that are to close to together and ones that cross over and shade branches below. You will need to look at these crossovers and choose which branch to save. Try not to cut off all the interior lower branches as we are trying to promote growth growth and fruiting here. The goal is to have fruit all the way to the trunk and leaves in the interior that are exposed to light.I suggest making fewer large cuts rather than lots of little detail cuts in the first two years and in the third year you can start to select small branches to save or remove. You will need to cut ladder bays for ladder placement during pruning and harvest.For the younger trees decide which of the lower limbs will be your permanent scaffold limbs. These are the major limbs that you will retain for the life of the tree. We want 3 to 5 scaffolds in each whorl of scaffolds and the whorls should be about 3 feet apart on the trunk. Each scaffold should head in a different direction and they should be separated by at least 6 to 8 inches on the trunk. If they are too close to together on the trunk they will merge as they grow forming a solid ring of branches at on point of the trunk and choking the central leader reducing its growth. None of the scaffolds should be more that half the diameter of the trunk. The branch angle should be wide. You can cut off limbs you know you need to remove at any time. The worst time to prune is in the fall when the trees are preparing for winter. Sweet cherries often branch at the shoot tips with 3 vigorous branch coming from the buds at the tip of the shoot. Generally we remove all but one of the vigorous branches and also leave less vigorous branches below.Cherry rootstocks are undergoing a revolution now with the release of dwarfing rootstocks developed in Europe. Mazzard (sweet cherry) and Mahaleb (perfume cherry) were the industry standard for centuries before. Mahaleb is the industry standard yielding a smaller tree and more fruit. Mazzard is preferred in wet sites or when Armillaria root rot (oak root fungus) is a known problem. The Gisela rootstocks give various degrees of dwarfing and commercial growers who by thousands of trees a year have to purchase their trees 3 to 4 years in advance. These rootstocks are patented and are only produced by a few nurseries which cannot keep up with the demand. smaller retail and mail order nurseries have not been able to compete with the demand for these rootstocks. I do not know how you would get your hands on them. You can probably find Mazzard and Mahaleb rootstocks from small independent nurseries, especially if they grow their own rootstock. Mazzard and Mahaleb are seeding rootstocks produced from seed rather than the clonal dwarfing rootstocks which are produced by stool beds or tissue culture. A small nursery might sell you a small lot of liners. Grafting is done in the early spring before growth begins. One year old shoots are selected in the dormant season and kept cold and dormant until needed in the spring. You can search the internet for videos on grafting. I would suggest that you also consider budding which is the way commercial nurseries graft trees by the thousands. Budding is usually done in late July and August. Again you can find videos on budding on the internet.",

      {
        "response":"Lori    What size emitters should I use for small boxwood hedge. 1\/2 gph. or 1 g ph.    By giving me this emitter rate, I think you are speaking about inline drip irrigation tubing which has built-in emitters at 12 or 18 spacing. Point source drip irrigation uses tubing with no built-in emitters. For point source drip line, you punch a hole and insert the emitter of your choice. Therefore you can have an emitter at each plant and choose the gph rate you want. You are not limited to  or 1gph.     Choosing an emitter rate and spacing has to do with the soil and plant water requirements. Clay soil absorbs water very slowly and sandy soil absorbs water very quickly and runs straight down. In both cases, use the slowest emitters, 1\/2 gph. This allows for slow absorption in the clay soil and will allow the roots in sandy soil more time to absorb the water instead of the water running through the soil.    2. Should I set up 2 emitters per boxwood?     You can do this pretty precisely with point source but with inline drip tubing you attach the tubing and the spacing is determined by the emitter spacing. If using inline drip tubing, the spacing is not as precise but it will work and there is not the worry of the emitters stopping up particularly if you use drip irrigation filter at the water source.     If using point source, place one emitter at the base of each plant. This is how vineyards do it. I do this in my rose garden. Not up against the trunk. Clay soil moves water horizontally so the emitter does not have to be too close but sandy soil the water runs straight down unless you have added good compost to the sandy soil. Compost will absorb the water quickly and release it to the plant roots. You also want to be able to check the emitters for blockage if you have calcium in the water. I check mine once a year when I cut back my roses.    3. Should I put emitters on both sides of the boxwoods, or should I put them inbetween each boxwood? I was planning on planting the boxwoods 2 1\/2' apart.    One emitter per shrub underneath each shrub if using point source on clay soil. Use two emitters if sandy soil. If suing inline tubing do not worry so much about the spacing pre shrub. Use the 12 spacing in the line and 12 between tubing. So at 2.5 inch spacing, yes you will have tubing on each side of the shrub. Visit any of the rip irrigation web site. They have great tutorials.    http:\/\/www.netafim-usa-landscape.com\/ http:\/\/www.digcorp.com http:\/\/www.rainbird.com\/drip\/index.htm http:\/\/www.toro.com\/sprinklers\/guides.html    ",

        "response":"I am across the country from you in North Carolina, but I will give it a go.It does look like herbicide damage. Could be drift - if conditions are right (low humidity &amp; high temperature), herbicides can vaporize and be carried for a good distance). Also consider if compost was used and source of the compost and consider what you may be using as mulch - herbicides can often persist and the solanacea family of plants are susceptible.Contact your local Cooperative Extension Office and speak with an Agriculture or Horticulture Agent. You can send photos or take a sample into the office for help with diagnosis.Thanks for using eXtension.Debbie",

        "response":"Hello,  Yes, Anthuriams are not the easiest plant to grow.they are not picky about the soil that they grow in except that it needs to be a highly organic soil that can retain lots of moisture. It needs however, to be well drained so that the roots don't become waterlogged.  So first, remove any dead or dying foliageand flowers. Workpeat moss intoyour soilbase. Make sure that Anthuriums are getting high and long light but not direct sunlight. Waterthoroughly but allow it todry out slightly between waterings. Important: Do not over-water the anthuriums as it may cause root damage and yellowing of the leaves. Fertilize the anthurium plant about every other month with a balanced liquid fertilizer. If in the ground and not in a pot, you can use slow release fertilizer once a season. Don't letit get 'cold'- avoid cold winds and excessive changes of temperature. In the winter letyour plant 'rest' for5-6 weeks. 15 deg. C.- say in your basement? With very little water.  After that time, repot, fertilize and water regularly to start up the production of the colorful bracts.",

        "response":"Hello, I have reached out to the food safety team here with UNH Cooperative Extension. Below is the answer that I received. I hope this will be helpful. There isnt really any information on this size jar. The closest bit of information comes from So Easy to Preserve pg. 24,    The shape and size of a jar does have an effect on the safety of the canning process, so it should not be assumed that our recommended processes can be used with jars other than the standard sizes and shapes of Mason-type jars manufactured for home canning. Some of these jars have one-piece or other types of lid systems that may or may not offer the same type of air venting and sealing success as the two-piece lid system described here. The suitability of jars and lid systems for our recommended process times will be limited by the size and shapes of jars, as well as heat tempering for canning. As long as the proper jar type, size and shape is used with properly researched canning procedures, the lid choice itself (e.g., two-piece metal, plastic or one-piece metal lids) does not affect the microbiological safety of the canning process. The issues become ease of use, success in sealing and maintenance of vacuum and food quality during storage.      So the lid choice, especially if she sees food safe on the label should be okay to use, but she may run into quality problems with sealing and shelf life. If they dont vacuum seal properly there could be mold growth. The reliable resources dont have information on the jars and lids shes using, so it is out of the realm of something I can offer concrete advice on.    A recommended processing time of 5 minutes since thats the shortest time youll find in an approved recipe. Be sure to have some type of rack-system in the boiling water canner.   If she is planning to sell these products, she needs to go through a process review since there is no official approved recipe for canning things of that size. For more information, please consider contacting our Food Safety Team directly through the link below: http:\/\/extension.unh.edu\/Food-Safety\/Meet-Team",

        "response":"The insects in your photos are bed bugs, scientific name: Cimex lactularius, in the family Cimicidae. As you may well be aware, bed bugs are pests that feed on human blood, and it is likely that you have an infestation in several rooms in your home, most likely the bedrooms, but they could be in other areas too. They hide during the day in cracks, crevices, on and under mattresses and other areas nearby to where humans sleep. They emerge at night to \"bite\" and suck blood from sleeping people. The bites are almost painless, but they do leave a distinctive red itchy mark on the skin. Bed bugs are notoriously difficult to control, and you will likely have to have a professional pest control company come to treat your home. In many areas, bed bugs have become resistant to pesticides, so many exterminators are resorting to using heat treatmentsto heat the furniture and rooms to temperatures that are lethal to the bugs. You will likely have to treat most of the rooms in your home and thoroughly wash all bedding materials and clothing from the affected areas to prevent reinfestation. I have included somelinks below towebsites with more information about bed bugs, but there are many websites online with more information about controlling them. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Bed_bug https:\/\/www.epa.gov\/bedbugs",

Mites can be hard to see, and a microscope is needed to identify the type. The leaf spots do not resemble those caused by any disease that I am aware of.  The large tan spots look like physical damage; possible causes include sunscald, burn from concentrated fertilizer on leaves, and herbicide.  The dark spots and yellowing could be due to mites (take these to extension with the fruit), and could be due to aging and nutrient deficiency.  I have seen similar on older leaves of my tomatoes especially when planting is delayed.",

        "response":"The overall issue may simply be transplant shock, which the plants may outgrow over time if they are given the right fertility, planting depth, and irrigation. The large white area looks like sunburn, which may happen when plants are moved, pruned, or have leaf drop, which exposes previously-shaded leaves to full sun. It is made worse by drought or drying wind. The small insects look like they might be brown citrus aphid. A hard stream of water will remove them, but this will need to be repeated regularly. Take care in the application of any pesticides if the plants are in full sun, because there may be some burn if there are oils or soaps in the spray. ",

It could be too much or too little, or it could be something is wrong with the root system, which could be water related or due to something else such as a tight root ball. 2 minutes and 4 minutes of watering doesn't really tell us anything about how much water the plants are actually getting. In fact, it doesn't sound like much at all. However, the best way to know what the soil moisture situation is like, is to carefully dig up one of the plants and inspect the roots and the soil in the hole. The soil should be moist down to the bottom of the hole, but not saturated. If it is real soggy and the roots are brown and slimy then it is too wet. Of course, the opposite would be true if it is too dry; the roots would be brown and dry. An irrigation audit might be helpful too. This entails running the system for a period of time, measuring how much water was distributed, and then digging a hole after it has time to soak in and see how deep it actually penetrated.",

The photo is a little blurry so I can't see all the details, but I suspect this is a cigarette beetle, scientific name: Lasioderma serricorne, in the beetle family Ptinidae. These beetles are one of a variety of common pantry pests, infesting and feeding in stored cereal products, seeds, nuts, spices, chocolate, pet foods, and many other things made from dried plant material. They are harmless to humans or animals. The key to getting rid of them is going through your food storage areas and finding any products that have become infested and disposing of them. Thoroughly vacuum and clean cupboard areas. Storing these types of products in tightly sealed \"Tupperware\" style containers can help prevent reinfestation.

Unfortunately, the spider in your photo is too blurry for me to identify with any certainty beyond that. The extremely long legs and small body suggest that this is most likely afunnel-weaver spider in the family Agelenidae, or possibly a wolf spider in the family Lycosidae. Both of these types of spiders are generally considered harmless to humans, as are the vast majority of spiders. Bites from either of these types of spiders would be rare and generally no more severethan a bee sting. Both these types of spiders occasionally wander into homes, but generally do not live indoors. I would need a much clearer close-up photo of this spider to be able to identify it with any more certainty. Spiders found indoors can be simply vacuumed up or killed with most household insect sprays.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"This appears to be a loquat tree. Here is what I found out:    Loquat (Japanese plum or Japanese medlar) is probably one of the more familiar of all tropical fruit plants in Texas, although few people outside of south Texas have only rarely grown the fruit. The plant is extremely cold hardy and is commonly grown as an ornamental from north Texas to the Valley.    Native to China, the loquat tree is an evergreen with large, stiff leaves. Growing alone in the open, the tree is very symmetrical, with a compact, dense crown, and can attain a height of 25 feet and a spread of 15 to 20 feet. The leaves are glossy, dark green above and whitish to rusty tomentose beneath. These characteristics of the tree have made the loquat an excellent specimen or accent in the home landscape.    CLIMATE    The mature loquat tree can withstand temperatures of 10 degrees without serious injury, but both flowers and fruit are killed at temperatures below about 27. Unfortunately, loquat blooms in late fall to early winter and must mature its fruit during the winter months. Thus, fruiting rarely occurs except in south Texas or following mild winters in south central or southeast Texas.    SOIL AND SITE SELECTION    Loquat is very well adapted to virtually all soils that have good internal drainage and are relatively non-saline. Soil pH does not seem to matter, as the trees grow equally well in the acid soils of east Texas and the alkaline soils of north, central and south Texas.    If fruit production is a consideration, loquats should be planted on the south or southeast side of the residence to obtain maximum cold protection from the house itself. Otherwise, plant it wherever in the landscape that is desired.    VARIETIES    Quite a large number of selections have been named over the years, several of which are grown in south Florida. Because the fruit has never achieved commercial status in the U.S., nurserymen tend to propagate the trees as loquats rather than as a particular variety of loquat. In Texas, it is likely that most of the loquats are from seed or were vegetatively propagated from seedlings. Consequently, fruit quality is highly variable among loquats in Texas.    PROPAGATION    Loquat is readily propagated from seed, although seedlings are frequently self-infertile and do not come true from seed. Veneer grafting and shield budding onto seedling rootstocks are both fairly successful. Air layering is a good way to propagate from a tree that bears particularly good fruit.    PLANTING AND ESTABLISHMENT    A loquat tree obtained from the local nursery will undoubtedly be container-grown in soilless media. Because soilless media forms an interface with the soil of a planting site, across which neither roots, air nor water move readily, one cannot simply take the plant from the pot and put it into a planting hole intact--as growth will be extremely slow. To assure survival and immediate growth, some of the medium should be removed from the sides and top of the root ball to expose some of the roots. This is best accomplished with a gentle stream of water from the garden hose, removing about an inch of the medium all around the ball. Upon planting, the outer roots in the ball are thereby placed into direct contact with the soil of the planting site, so survival and growth are assured, given proper watering.    Water thoroughly at planting and again every three or four days for the first week. Afterwards, lengthen the interval between waterings over the next several months until the tree is well established. For ease of watering, construct a water ring several inches high and thick, and a couple of feet across, atop the soil around the newly planted tree. Then, simply fill the ring with water as needed. In time, the ring will melt into the surrounding soil, at which time the plant will have become established.    Fertilize only after new growth commences. Use the same fertilizer as you use on the lawn grass (except do not use a fertilizer that contains a weed killer) or use ammonium sulfate (21-0-0) or whatever general fertilizer is recommended by the County Extension Agent in your area.    Based on ammonium sulfate, the young tree should receive about one cup during its first year, two cups in the second and three cups in its third year. For optimal results, the fertilizer should be split into three or more applications annually. Just scatter it on the ground and water it in.    Because a young tree cannot compete well with weeds and turfgrass, an area 2 to 3 feet in diameter, centered on the tree, should be kept free of all other vegetation. The unwanted vegetation can be killed out with a systemic herbicide, then a thick layer of organic mulch will keep it out.    MATURE TREE CARE    Continue to care for the tree as during establishment as regards water, mulching and weed control. As for nutrition, a pound per inch of trunk diameter annually is adequate, with split applications in March and June or March, June and September.    Loquat trees normally do not require pruning, as the tree establishes its natural shape without pruning, assuming that it has adequate space into which to develop.    PRODUCTION, MATURITY AND USE    Loquats should begin to bear in 2 to 3 years, with a well-developed older tree easily producing 100 pounds of fruit. A particularly heavy crop will usually be of smaller fruit size.    The flower panicles normally appear in the late fall on the ends of the branches; the flowers are fragrant, though small and not especially showy. The fruit matures in late winter to spring. Typically, the fruit is about 1.5 inches long and perhaps an inch wide, globose to pear-shaped and pale yellow to golden orange at maturity. It is firm and juicy, and contains two or three large, smooth, dark brown seeds. The flavor varies from sweet to tangy, depending upon the variety or selection.    The fruit can be eaten fresh from the tree or frozen intact for later use. It also can be made into excellent jelly, jam, preserves, cobbler or pies. Hoe this helps!    ",

It allows 1 or more members to delay votes and so yes, it is legal. It was seldom used in Congress up until the 1960's but since then (possibly with our more polarized political system) it has become more frequently used. The filibuster was strengthened in the Senate in 1975. There are 2 ways to stop a filibuster. One, if the individual or group quits talking, they lose the floor in essence. The more likely way it can end is if 3\/5ths of the Senate votes for closure of the filibuster. That requires 60 senators to agree which is unfortunately difficult in today's climate. A filibuster is not just used in the United States but all over the world. Hope that helps. ",

The main issue is going through any court (local, appellate, Supreme) takes someone who has the money to hire an attorney or law firm to take it as far as they can. This amounts to thousands and hundreds of thousands in Supreme Court cases which is why there are not more than there is. The Supreme Court also determines which cases it will hear.

We grow coast redwood in the Willamette Valley and it will exhibit drought stress, but it is usually older leaves that are affected. This appears to be affecting current-season's growth, which is a different matter and more worrisome. Coast Redwood is of course not native to this part of Oregon and is well outside the coastal fog belt to which it is adapted. You don't mention if you are in an inland situation but of course if so then I presume that would predispose the trees to drought stress. It is tough for me to determine if it is drought stress or something else, but the good news is that you have a UC Extension office at your disposal to assist with that. I would take photos of the whole tree (s) to them and see if they can'tdiagnose the problem as they will be far more familiar with the environment and this tree's performance in your area.Address of the office is below.http:\/\/cesanmateo.ucanr.edu\/",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I did not find a video for you, but the following is helpful information on the practice of espaliering a young apple tree. Sounds like a great idea! Espaliered trees bring fruit down to eye level. They allow for easy picking and take advantage of small spaces. But dont kid yourself into thinking espaliers are any easier than regular-sized trees, said Ross Penhallegon, a horticulturist with Oregon State Universitys Extension Service. Espalier is one of many ways to prune  or design -- a fruit tree, he said. Its beautiful, it doesnt take up a lot of room in the yard. There are a lot of reasons to do it, but it takes dedication and time. Its like growing grapes or wisteria correctly. In espalier, tree branches are typically trained flat along the wires of a trellis, which may be of several types, depending on how difficult an espalier project you want to attempt. In addition to a trellis, trees can be supported by a wall, wooden fence, or deer or cattle fencing. If the trellis will be attached to a building, consider how it will look. Even though the trellis may be removed once the tree has reached its final, rigid state, it will need to remain in place long enough to support the tree, which can be up to 10 years. The most important aspect of growing an espaliered tree, which can be any type of fruit but is usually an apple, is pruning. Unlike an open canopy tree, Penhallegon said, an espalier must be pruned several times during the growing season in order to keep in control. Thats a lot of cutting, he said. Most people dont know how to prune, so its important to do your research before beginning. Penhallagon offers the following instructions for the simplest way to espalier an apple tree: Build a trellis by setting posts 8 feet apart and stretch 12-guage or heavier galvanized wire between them 18 inches from the ground. At that time you can add more levels of wire, typically three, each 18 inches taller than the other. Alternatively, you can wait until the following years when its time to train another level to add additional wires.Buy a 1- or 2-year-old tree, preferably a dwarf variety, and plant in the middle of the trellis, usually in February. Attach two supple branches, which are called laterals, to the first level of wire, one going left and one going right. Prune out the thickest branch, which is generally in the middle and called the leader, and any other branches. As the season goes on, weak branches  called suckers  will grow straight up. These need to be removed regularly. If they are young enough, rub off with your thumb or, if too thick, cut them off. Also appearing will be stubbier shoots  called spurs. Leave one about every 6 inches and cut off the rest. As they begin to grow, prune the spurs down to three leaves. This is where fruit will form after two years. The year after beginning the espalier, start another level by training two lateral branches along the next level of wire and cutting off any additional branches. The following year, add another level.After four years, cut off all spurs along one of the branches along the bottom wire to allow new ones to form. The next year, prune off spurs on the other branch on that same wire. In subsequent years, do the same thing, working your way up each level of the espalier.Hope this helps!",

    "title-question":"Another infestation of bird (?) mites. Hello, 2 years ago when I first moved in to my apartment, within the 1st week, I realized I had an infestation of mites, I determined it was bird mites. I determined this by looking at the samples I collected under a microscope, to images I'd seen online. Anyway, after the exterminator sprayed and fogged my apartment and a hell of a lot of cleaning and laundry, they seemed to disappear. In those 2 years I've never opened any of the windows of my apartment because they face trees and hundreds of birds inhabit them and the surrounding roof top of the next-door apartment building. I didn't want to get another infestation. Well, 2 years later, almost to the day, the mites are back. I've only found 2, maybe 3 specimens, but I have about 7-8 bug bites, very similar to the ones I had 2 years ago on my arms and back. I also have that creepy crawly sensation all over my body and scalp. So, my question is, how did they re-infest after nearly 2 years and I never opened my windows? I have no pets. I did just start using the air conditioner off and on but I used it all last summer and there was no infestation. My landlady is going to call the exterminator again. It seemed to work last time.

      {
        "response":"First, I would take a sample of the mites to your local county Extension office to get an identification from an expert. if you do have bird mites, they usually enter a home when birds abandon a nest and the mites leave to find another host. I suspect that there is a nest(s) somewhere in your building, perhaps in your air conditioner. Once you find where they are nesting, you can use exclusion to keep them from returning. Finding an removing the nest is the first step in getting rid of the mites. Vacuuming may help.

I also found this nice, short essay from the U. of California. It looks like it is a pretty adaptable plant, as partly evidenced by its appearance in your garden. It prefers part to full sun, can tolerate dry conditions, and can grow to relatively large size (in terms of clump size), due to spread by underground rhizomes.",

The bark peeling does not look pathological, almost like some trees species that peel their bark to a smooth undersurface naturally. From what I can see of the crown (top), the tree looks pretty healthy. With that amount of peeling, if it were a disease, then you would probably see branch dieback in the top of the tree. The leaves look like sweetgum, but the bark is suspicious!The tiny dots on the leaves appear to be some previous feeding damageby an insect. These will do no lasting harm to the tree. ",

        "response":"As long as the other birds are acting normally they are probably fine. Disease organisms impact each bird differently depending on many variables. Some mortality in a poultry flock should be considered normal, however one bird in a small flock is a big event. Age, breed, feed, environment, prevalence of disease organisms, etc all play a role. If other birds show similar problems, a proper diagnosis may be in order. California has a good veterinary diagnostic lab system that can diagnose the problem. Contact the local Extension or CDFA office, or look on line to get contact information, I believe that the closest lab to your location in Placer county is in Sacramento.Good Luck",

There is also a type of grass we do like and would like to plant more but are not positive what it is. We think it might be Bermuda. I have attached 2 pictures of the Weeds. 1of the pictures is of the Weeds in the ground (we did try a weed and feed so some parts of the Weeds are dying) and 1 picture of a pile of some we've pulled out. The 3rd picture is of the grass we like. There are some Weeds in that picture in the upper left hand corner. We really want to know how to get rid of the Weeds. We have been digging them out. But since they are attached to each other by roots under the ground we are tearing up the whole yard. If there is an easier way please to get rid of them please let me know.

You are best off to take a sample of your plant to your local Extension office for diagnosis, but this disease is quite common this time of year.  Rust is treatable, but your better option is to purchase plants that are rust resistant and rogue out of your garden those plants that do not tolerate your local environmental conditions. To treat it with chemicals will require a continuing and frequent program of fungicides.

Make sure this tree receives ample water only to the root system (not the trunk, branches or leaves), mainly where the damage was done. Hopefully you were able to apply a constant trickle-of-water to this tree immediately following the planting of other specimens. Depending on the weather in your area, you may have to water the root system every day for at least an hour until the tree starts to respond. The roots of a tree are extremely important to the entire health of the specimen as they store and provide the nutrients to the entire vascular system. Damage to the root system can cause the tree to decline, inviting a host of insect and disease to attack. ~DOT",

        "response":"Hello,My name is Brad Cochran and I am an Extension Agent at West Virginia State University. Looking your photos and also seeing that the leaves are turning yellow, I would lean more towards a nutrient deficiency as opposed to a watering issue. Since your tree is in a container, I would recommend a slow release fertilizer that is formulated for fruits and vegetables that will give a slow feed a nutrients each time you water your tree, as opposed to a traditional commercial fertilizer that is a one-time shot of food that will need to be repeated quite often. I won't recommend specific brands of this slow release fertilizer, but some common types are called Osmocote, Sta-Green and I think Miracle-Gro has one available now too. Jobe's also has the fertilizer spikes available that do a pretty good job as well.If, in fact, this is a watering only issue then it is likely that you are under-watering. However, the easiest way to tell this is if the leaves are starting to wilt, curl or dry. If you are not seeing these issues then under-watering likely isn't the problem.Also, I just want to be sure that your container has a drain hole at the bottom. If this isn't present then it could be an over-saturation issue. If there is a drain hole, then you shouldn't have to worry about over-watering which is a great aspect of container production.If you have any questions please feel free to reply here or contact me directly at bcochran2@wvstateu.edu.Thanks,Brad CochranWVSU Extension Service",

        "response":"Healthy citrus trees can bear heavy crops of fruit, but in doing so naturally abort\/shed a large number of fruit. The greatest drop is during bloom, when the tiny fruitlets are pea-sized. Additional abortion of marble, dime and quarter-sized fruit continues into the month of June, diminishing as the season progresses. The size of your fruit looks like typical June drop. Some years the June drop may be more or less depending on a variety of factors. The only thing you can control in regards to fruit abortion is nutritional health and watering the roots. Citrus trees are heavy feeders and thus need annual fertilizer. Watering--not too much and not too little--is also important during the fruit set periods from bloom set through June. I suspect that what you are seeing is natural abortion for this season, but it is a good time to review your state fact sheets on citrus to determine if you have been applying enough fertilizer. Monitor soil moisture during bloom to prevent water stress from increasing the rate of fruit abortion.",

        "response":"Your tomato have been damaged by herbicide; this may occur in one of two ways: Spray drift when weeds were treated, or by herbicide carryover in organic materials added to or on the soil, among them manures, composted or not.   Unfortunately, this has been a widespread problem across the country for a number of years.    The underlying situation is that one of several different agricultural herbicides were used against broadleaf weeds in such crops as pastures or grain fields. (Such contamination has also occurred in commercially packaged composts and potting mixes.)    When livestock feed on the grass or grain, these herbicides survive the trip through the animals guts and are excreted in the manure which is then composted. In order for the chemicals to be inactivated, the manure must be hot composted for a year before use in gardens.    Here are several helpful resources which describe how the damage occurred; how to verify the contamination via a simple bio-assay; and what you can do to remedy the situation.   - Page 3 of Herbicide carryover in hay, manure, compost, and grass clippings describes an easy bio-assay you can do: http:\/\/content.ces.ncsu.edu\/herbicide-carryover    - Numerous images of various affected plants as well as informative text (via the menu at left of the page) including a bio-assay are in Herbicide Contamination Organic Matter: (http:\/\/whatcom.wsu.edu\/ag\/aminopyralid\/)   As a safety measure, I now suggest gardeners do a bio-assay prior to using any composted materials obtained from other sources.",

Some forms have showy leaves in which the green is heavily marked with silver. The leaves will die back to the ground but will grow again next year.    In some places, such as here in the northwestern US, it is considered an invasive plant because it can seed at a distance when birds carry off the fleshy covered seeds. In your images, the fleshy-covered seeds are the yellow structures at the end of the wand-like stem.    If you ever decide to get rid of this arum, you will need to dedicate sufficient time  and energy -- to dig out all of the deep roots. If any fragments remain, they will re-sprout.

        "response":"I suspect your problem is related to accumulation of salts in the barrel and high soil salinity. We have not had normal rainfall during the last 5 winters and there is accumulation of salts in field soils and containers that have been subject to irrigation and no leaching of accumulated salts. You can try leaching - extended periods of watering until water runs out of the bottom of the barrel. You may want to also attempt to repot the plant in the barrel or at least scoop out the existing soil and replace with new potting soil. Then start a watering regime that adds enough water for water to run out of the bottom each time you water. If we get normal rainfall in the rainy season, expose the plant to as much pure rain water as possible.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Your question does not mention what your evaluation question is, and that is a critical piece of information for determining the best method of data analysis. However, since you have included these four sets of scores in your question (pretest, posttest, parent education, and student gender), I will assume that you want to answer two specific questions:     1. Did students scores increase overall from pretest to posttest?  Lets assume that there was a program or intervention between those two sets of scores.   2.  Was the program more effective for some students than for others, based on the demographic variables of parent education and student gender?  For example, maybe the program was more effective with girls than boys, or vice-versa.     To address those questions, there are several ways to analyze the data.  A relatively straightforward approach is to use two distinct analyses.  First, conduct a paired t-test to compare the pretest vs. posttest scores.  If that difference in mean scores is statistically significant (with the mean for post being higher than the mean for pre), you will know that the students, overall as a group, increased their scores from pre to post.  You might then want to conclude that the program was the reason behind the increase, that is, the program was effective. That conclusion assumes that there wasnt any other factor causing that gain, but it is a conclusion that is typically made with pre-post scores.      To examine your second question, there would be a few sub-steps.  First, construct a gain score for each student (that is, the students posttest score minus pretest score). Then you would examine the association of these gain scores with the two demographic variables.  You could examine them together in a single analysis using multiple regression, but a simpler approach would be to conduct each of those tests separately (that is, the relationship of gain scores with gender and the relationship of gain scores with parent ed).  For gender, you would do an independent groups t-test, in which you compare the average gain scores for boys and girls.  For parent education, you would use an analysis of variance (ANOVA), which is needed when you have more than two groups.  (Im assuming you have more than two groups for parent education, but if you only have two groups, you can use a t-test there as well.) If any of those tests are statistically significant, it will indicate that the program was more effective for some groups than for others, and you can examine the mean scores to determine what the direction of those differences was.   Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello,   It would be helpful to know exactly what kind of tree it is.  Generally to kill a vigorously growing tree like this the recommendation would be to use a 'stump regrowth preventative\" herbicide.  Usually the instructions say cut the trunk and IMMEDIATELY paint it with an application of herbicide before the cut is dry and 'hardened' off. You should be able to find severalstump killing products that can be applied directly to freshly cut stumps (ready to use) as well as others that require mixing before use.Look for products withactive ingredients of: 2, 4-D, dicamba, glyphosate, imazapyr, picloram, and triclopyr.Several manufacturers make these and sell under many different trade names. .  What's important is that the treatment must generally occur immediately after cutting. Always read the label to check on correct usage.Optimal results will be had by applying a product that is known to work on your specific species of plant.  In rare instances as we have found here in trying to control bamboo, mechanical removal with a bulldozer or a root grinder is needed to remove as much of the root as possible. Any remnant sprouts can then be dealt with using the stump treatments.  Good luck..",

You can rinse the knife off with hot water to remove any obvious blood and then wash the knife with dishwashing detergent or in your dishwasher. The carpet can be cleaned with a cleaner appropriate for your type of carpet that will remove blood. Check the carpet cleaner label, and it should say on what types of stains it's effective.

Colors include the pink as in your image, also purples, white, striped, and yellow. It grows from a tuber and thrives with minimum attention with the bonus of fragrant flowers.

It has a very wide host list (I could not find Stachys, but I would be surprised if it were NOT susceptible), and high soil moisture exacerbates the disease (now, this is also why it is relatively uncommon in residential landscapes in the Bay Area - our soils get quite dry in the summer); unfortunately, neem is unlikely to provide  control.

Several places recommend potted petunias be put into a soilless mix.You could then deadhead your petunias - a must if you want continual flowering and water with a liquid balanced fertilizer that has a high phosphorous content, such as 30\/30\/30 (the middle 30 is the Phosophorous number here) or even a 10\/30\/10; bone meal is also a good source of phosphorous. Petunias like high sun areas so keep them in a sunny spot. They are fairly drought tolerant - you should water weekly with a dilute liquid fertilizer and allow the soil to pretty much dry between waterings - although they do like it moist - it should be well drained.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Although it is less likely, yes, you can still overwater with a raised bed, it all depends on the type of soil and how long you water. The best way to check is simply to stick you hand in the soil and see how moist it is.Here are some general tips:Water in the morning, rather than at nightTry to avoid overhead watering: instead use soaker hoses or drip irrigation.These two practices will reduce your chances of diseases, especially fungal diseases and it will save water.If you do have soaker hoses or a drip irrigation system, you might as well add a timer to your spigot!It is better to water deeply once a day, than shallow multiple times a deep. Watering deeply will encourage the roots of the plants to go deeper into the soil, rather than just hover at soil level. That way, your plants will be able to get to water, even on a a day that you may not be there to water.Hope this helps.",

When it blooms, it has a spike of purple\/blue flowers that are quite attractive. It is native to much of the US, though not California, and can be somewhat invasive. I suggest you check with your local Extension office, soil and water conservation district, or whatever local agency deals with invasive plants, to see if it is a problem in your particular area, and also to confirm this identificaion.",

        "response":"The critter in your photo is not a spider. Rather it is a female velvet ant, scientific name: Dasymutilla sackenii, in the family Mutillidae. \"Velvet ants\" are actually not ants, but rather a type of solitary wasp related to spider wasps. Velvet ants typically are covered with white, yellow, orange, red or black hairs. On some the hairs are short which give them a fuzzy or velvety appearance. Yours is one of the species that have longer hairs. Female velvet ants do not have wings and spend their time running over the surface of the ground. They seek out the burrows of sand wasps and lay their eggs on the developing larvae of the wasp, on which their own larva will develop. Female velvet ants have very armored bodies and potent stingers to protect them from the wasps whose nests they are invading. The brightly colored hairs are considered aposematic, or warning colorstoadvertisethattheyhaveapotentsting.Males are usually smaller, have wings and no stingers. The velvet ant in your photo is fairly common in the deserts and arid areas of southern California. It is believed the long white fuzzy hairs mimic the seed pods of creosote bushes which blow over the ground in the desert. This resemblance helps hide them from their own potential predators. I have included some links below to websites with more information about velvet ants. https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mutillidae http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/13124",

The eggs are creamy white when laid but develop a reddish-brown band just prior to hatching. Larvae (caterpillars) hatch from the eggs. The larvae are yellowish-white with a brown head. The color of older larvae varies from greenish-yellow to brown or even black with paler stripes running lengthwise on the body. Larvae grow to a size of about 1 inches in length. There are other worms that affect tomatoes that are explained in the article.    http:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/hgic\/pests\/plant_pests\/veg_fruit\/hgic2218.html    I like to use insecticidal soaps against caterpillars.

Other reasons include diseases (harmful to cats and dogs as well as humans), parasites (fleas, especially), and danger to local wildlife (birds, lizards, etc.).Please don't feed the cats.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The spider in your photo is the silver garden spider, scientific name: Argiope argentata, in the family Araneidae. There is probably no definitive answer on how spiders \"keep their cool\", because it depends on the species, location and other factors.Spiders are \"cold blooded\", meaning they can't regulate their temperature physiologically, rather their body temperature just remains close to the ambient air temperature. However, they can do things behaviorally. Many spiders are only active at night, remaining hidden in secluded places during the day. This is mainly to avoid predators, but this would also mean they are not as exposed to daytime temperatures or direct sunlight. A spider that was \"overheating\" during the day would likely move under a leafor other object to avoid direct sunlight. Spiders and insects in general can tolerate temperatures up to about 110 degrees Fahrenheit before it becomes lethal. Also, because of their small size, insects and spiders have less surface areathat would be exposed to the sunlight, and consequently don't heat up as fast as some larger animals.You can actually put small insects and spiders into a microwave and zap them at high power and they hardly heat up at all, because there is not enough water inside their bodies for the microwaves to act upon. It probably works the same way with direct sunlight. Your silver garden spider has other factors that probablyhelp it. It is primarily a tropical species that barely extends up into California. Therefore, it has probably become more adaptedand tolerant of heat than other kinds of spiders from temperate areas.Even though it is sitting out on its web exposedto the direct sunlight,it is far away from other surfaces such as leaves, the ground, etc. that might reflect or rediate a lot of heat. So being in the center of its web, may actually be the coolest place around.Parts of the underside and top side of the spider are covered with silvery hairs that also reflect some of the light andprevent somesunlight and heat contactwith parts of the body. So all in all, your spider is sitting in the middle of its web on a hot day in the direct sunlight, mainly because it does not bother it and itis completly tolerant of those conditions.It might take temperatures well above100 degrees, beforeit might feel the need to move. Other types ofspiders maynot be able to do this, and this actually givessilver garden spiders an advantage because it allows themto catch insect prey in their webs when other spiders are not active.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Research shows that most turf grasses need about 1 to 1 1\/2 inches of water every week from rainfall and\/or irrigation during the growing season. We typically recommend applying about 1\/2 inch of water two or three times each week to accomplish this. During very high temperature periods of summer, additional water may be required to avoid stress to the grass. Obviously, during cooler periods when the grass is less active, much less water will be required. But, it's difficult to give an exact figure. The bottom line is to look for signs of drought stress - curling of leaf blades, loss of the the vibrant, dark green color - and water thoroughly to alleviate the stress. The other question most ask is, \"How long does it take to apply 1\/2 inch of water?\" If you have in-ground irrigation, zones with rotating heads will usually require 30 to 40 minutes. Fixed heads (sprays) about half that much time.A simple way to know is to place tuna or pet food cans around the area and turn the irrigation on. The cans are about 1\" tall, so it's an easy calculation. You can also do the same with rain gauges. I do live under the water restrictions and other issues associated with southern California, so you may want to check with some of the local people.",

The theory is that the reason these flowers resemble spiders is to attract the female spider wasp which hunts spiders. The wasp enters the lip of the flowers and instead of finding a spider covers herself with pollen and then leaves the flowers and goes on to the next one thus pollinating the plant.

I also suggest trying to find where the ants are coming from then sealing those entrances. Sometimes the ants will find other pathsinto your home if they are available.  Also, there are a number of borax-based baits that can be placed in the path of the ants. These products are designed to be carried back to the nest and kill the colony. I can take some time, but it will usually solve the problem and is relatively safe compared to most aerosol products. Many apartment complexes have regular pest control programs for ants and roaches. You may check with your management to see what they are doing for pest control as well.",

I would suggest that for future replies, you contact me directly at my office email address, provided below in my signature (I can access my email faster and more easily than the eXtension site). I have a couple of articles I wrote about gardening for the blind, which unfortunately were never made into true Purdue publications.  I don't appear to be able to attach them to this page, so if you send me an email, I can attach them that way. I have also put together a PowerPoint lecture on gardening with physical disabilities, within which I cover a number of tips for blind gardeners.  It's fairly large, so I'm not sure I can send that in any format.  I'd be glad to come out and present this program some time, but I'm not sure you can afford to fly me out...  One of the best books on gardening with physical disabilities is The Enabling Garden by Gene Rothert.  Gene is (or was) the manager of the enabling garden at the Chicago Botanic Garden.  He doesn't talk much about actual gardening, but mostly about numerous tricks, tips and techniques for getting around the garden with a wide range of disabilities, including blindness.  There's several other books I've used as well, but Gene's is by far the best. Here are some links that might be helpful:   Gardening for Blind or Partially Sighted People:  http:\/\/www.carryongardening.org.uk\/gardening-for-blind-and-partially-sighted-people.aspx  Gardening Tips (Vision Aware): http:\/\/www.visionaware.org\/info\/everyday-living\/recreation-and-leisure\/gardening\/123  Sensory Gardens (Univ. of Florida): http:\/\/edis.ifas.ufl.edu\/ep117  I hope this is enough to get you started.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"It is a bit of a challenge to identify these weeds through pictures. If you can findthe chapter of Master Gardener volunteers in your county or Extension Office, you are likely to get a much more accurate identification, information on how to best control each weed and more importantly what type of grasses grow best in your location.  For now, I suspect I am looking at dandelion (or a closely related Asteraceae weed), spurge (perhaps prostrate spurge, certainly a Euphorbiaceae family member) and one of the sowthistle species. It does not look like you are facing a specific weed problem, but a general problem in getting the lawn established in the first place. Typically, one of the best weed management strategies is to get a good grass species established (afterphysical removal ofthese weeds)that can successfully outcompete future broadleaf weed species. If an area is left free of grass, some \"weed\" is likely to colonize the area. First make sure you have an ample supply of water on hand to \"baby\" the lawnfor the first year afteryou seed, or sod the area. If not, look for some mulch, native plants, or something to cover the soil surface andoutcompete the weeds. Again, a healthy lawn takes proper planning, turf\/grass species selection, maintenance and hard work, so do not hesitate to contact a Master Gardener in your area. Note also,the healthy lawn will outcompete a lot of weed species. So I would suggest you focus on proper lawn management or landscaping first and weed management secondarily! Hope this info helps and good luck in your endeavors!",

They are much more in tune to what an appropriate turf would be, when it should be installed and when regular maintenance should occur. Where you are in RIverside may depend on which turf is more appropriate. See http:\/\/ucanr.edu\/sites\/RiversideMG\/for contact information. Beyond that, I recommend getting the soil tested so you know if you need lime (and how much) and what fertilizer type is most appropriate. I would also recommend investing in doing the install right. Soil preparation is critical. Incorporating 1-2 inches of compost prior to planting, for example, has shown to increase the rate of lawn establishment. More organic matter in the soil should also help with issues of compaction and help hold soil moisture. Thomas",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello,Do you know if your wolf spider was mature when she was rescued? (If she was quite large and has not molted since she was collected, she may have already been mature when captures). If she was mature, it is possible that she had already mated, and spiders are able to hold viable sperm for a very long time. So, there is a chance that the egg sac will still hatch. However, it is also possible that she is carrying around a non-viable egg sac. Wolf spiders carry their egg sacs under their abdomen. If your spider is not carrying hers and instead has left it on the ground, then she has effectively already abandoned it as non-viable. She should eventually stop carrying a non-viable egg sac, although how long this will take will vary greatly. It is also possible to gently remove the egg sac using tweezers when she is carrying it if you somehow think it is better to remove the non-viable egg sac from her? If you have had her for 3 months and this is the first time she has made an egg sac, it may be a signal of some change in her diet or environment, or sometimes she is nearing the end of her life span and is making one last attempt to produce offspring. Some wolf spiders can live for several years, although it is tough to know how old she was when you caught her. Thank you for saving her and caring for her!",

It takes a lot of energy to bloom, and even a tough plant like Gazania needs adequate food and water to make flowers. You should deadhead them (remove spent blooms) so they put their energy into making new blooms. They should be watered when the soil is dry, (but don't over-water) and you can feed them with a good general fertilizer. Look for one that is higher in the middle number (Phosphorus) than the first number (Nitrogen).

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Unfortunately, redwoods like a lot of water and often depend on irrigation water in urban areas. As the tree has less water it will shed leaves to try to balance water intake (from soil, rain and fog) and out-take (from the leaves). Extra mulching will not make much of a difference. Since the redwood looks a lot different than the other trees in the picture, additional water to the large redwood will be shared with the neighboring trees that may be more suited to the climate.",

RossGarden Grove, Ca",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Bird mites search for an alternative host when their nest is destroyed. The bird mites will crawl onto the skin and conduct an exploratory bite to test the appropriateness of the host. The mite will move on, possibly trying the host again, but will not feed. These bites are felt as a prick and a resultant rash and itching, sometimes intense, will occur. Some individuals are apparently capable of sensing the crawling of the mites on the skin. The irritation produced by the bite is enhanced by the injection of the mites saliva that can cause a localized histamine response. Differential diagnosis can be difficult in the absence of mite specimens and can easily be misdiagnosed as non-descript insect bites. Most bird mite infestations occur during the late spring to early summer when bird nests are in abundance. When investigating claims of \"insect bites\" during this time of year, physicians, entomologists, and pest management professionals should inquire as to the presence of bird nests in attics, soffits, rain gutters, shrubbery next to buildings, and on window sills and air conditioners.   Since most bird mite species complete development in five to twelve days with optimal temperatures and if appropriate host (Birds) are presence, the mites will die out without birds to parasitize. So a good hot shower and washing clothes in hot water will help. To treat bites and rash, consult a doctor or use one of the topical treatments for insect bites at the local pharmacy.

        "response":"Podocarpus are reputed to be fine with heavy pruning of branches and do not need large amounts of water. Most trees have at least 3x as many roots as they need to survive, so your tree should recover from the shock and will hopefully grow some new roots. I doubt heavy watering is going to help if it has less root area to absorb the water. However, Berkeley is nowhere near as warm as interior San Diego so you probably should consult with local experts.Bill",

        "response":"Balfour Aralia Care Instructions Many people ask us for the proper care of the Balfour Aralia- a member of the family Polyscias. By following these instructions, you should have no problem keeping your Balfour Aralia not only surviving, but thriving for years to come. The Aralias are some of the most sought after, interesting and unique plants used in homes, offices and interior landscapes due to their attractive appearance and scarcity on todays plant market. Aralias beauty comes with a price, as these plants are not one of the easiest to care for. Aralias originate from South East Asia and the Tropical Islands of the Pacific. ighting Requirements Aralias do best in well-lit locations such as a window sill that has an Eastern exposure. Bright but indirect sunlight is optimal. Be careful not to put your Aralia in full sun because in many cases the plant will burn and the leaves will be damaged in a similar way that people get sunburn. If you have less than optimal lighting available, we recommend choosing a different plant. Balfour Aralia have a low tolerance for less than optimal lighting conditions. In most cases, artificial lighting such as in a windowless office will not be enough.  From our experience Aralias are an excellent choice for bright light situations. Temperature Requirements The Aralia prefers the same temperatures that many homes are kept at on a daily basis. Night time temperatures in the lower 60s and day time temperatures in the 70s are ideal. Keep in mind that although your home or office are kept at these average temperatures, other factors may play a part in your plant being too hot or cold. Make sure that your Aralia is not directly affected by a heating or air conditioner vent. The direct cold or hot air will surely damage your plant. You also want to keep an eye on the window if you place your plant in or near one. On very cold days, the glass will transfer the cold  and if the leaves from your Anita are pressed against the glass, they will become damaged. It is never a good idea to have your Aralia up against any window or wall. You will also want to avoid any drafts in colder climates. A cold gust of wind from being placed near a door or window that opens could also damage your plant. Watering Balfour Aralias The most important thing to keep in mind when watering Aralias are that you want to avoid creating a situation that promotes root rot. In our homes and offices, we keep Aralias in a light, well-draining soil. They prefer to be kept on the dryer side, but not so dry that it damages the plant. There is not specific amount or frequency of water that we can suggest because the lighting, temperature and evaporation rates differ in every location. You will need to develop a feel for the proper amount of water. Try to water at an even amount of moisture, not letting your plant get soaking wet and then allowing it to completely dry out. Do not let water accumulate in the crown or cups that the leaves. Overwatering your Aralia could result in the plant dropping a significant amount of leaves. Moderation is key. Any planter that allows for evaporation, air flow and water drainage works well. Once you develop the feel for watering, you will be able to judge when to water by picking up the plant. The heavier the plant feels, the more moisture there is in the growing medium. If the plant is too large to lift, a water meter is well worth the investment.",

These podsmay be green, yellow, black, or purple in color. Each pod contains 46 beans.  On one hand, it might be frustrating trying to find the exact cultivar of bean.

When I inspected my succulents, I found a white powdery substance all over the roots and surface of my string of pearls plant and some gnats flew out! This white substance has also attached itself to many of the strings hanging down in between the pearls. The plant looks healthy otherwise. I moved it outside but obviously don't want to keep it outside as I live on the coast in Northern California. What is this and what do I do?Thank you",

      {
        "response":"Hello, if you are able to attache any pictures, I can be more specific- but it sounds like you have some insects in your plant. There are several insects that can be associated with \"white powdery substances\"- whitefly, scale, and mealybugs. If you tap the plant and tiny white flies come out, most likely it is whitefly. there are many species of scales, some of which produce a white powdery substance that obscures their bodies and makes them hard to recognize as insects. Likewise for mealybugs. The good news is these are pretty easy to control. If the plant is small enough, covering the soil with a plastic shopping bag, you can dip the plant into soapy water and gently run your fingers over the plant to remove the white stuff. Or, you can spray soapy water onto the plant. I prefer the first method because it removes the white powder better. Soap works against these insects by clogging their breathing holes. So it is actually necessary for the soapy water to make direct contact with their bodies. There are also insecticides available for these insects, but it would be better to know for sure which you were dealing with. I hope you find this information helpful, Nicole",

The visible portion of the fungus (the shelf) is actually the fruiting body of the organism. The part that you can't see, the root system (mycelia) is feeding on the wood inside the tree. In time, the wood will decay to a point where it can no longer hold up the tree. Unfortunately, there is no curative measures that you can use.

For instance, if you found the \"dust\" on a closet floor, and there was an old wool jacket above the dust on the floor. Adults are drawn to sunlight - they are searching for pollen and nectar. They are going to head to the closest window- so start your search in dark, less used spaces close to that window. Hope you find this helpful, Nicole",

Your photo isa ventral view of the spider, and several species have these same or very similar ventral markings. I would need to see an image of the top side of the spider to be absolutely sure of its identification. However, I believe this is most likely the arboreal orbweaver or spotted orbweaver, Neoscona crucifera, which is a mainlyeastern species that has recently extended its range into southern California. It issupposedlycommon inyards andsuburban areas, frequently building its large webs on fences, patios, buildings or near lights. It hides in a secluded place during the day and usually only comes out onto its large orbweb at night. It can be quite variable in color and dorsal patterns. Like most of these types of spiders, they are generally considered to be harmless. I have included some links below to webpages with more information and photos of this spider. Perhaps you can use these to compare to your spiderif it is still there. If it doesn't look the same, then it might be another species and I would need to see a good topside photo to be able to identify it further.  http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/28154 http:\/\/staffhttp:\/\/www.fullcoll.edu\/lvincent\/spiderguide\/\/xtra\/D1X.html http:\/\/www.spiders.us\/species\/neoscona-crucifera\/",

      {
        "response":"Unfortunately, I cannot be sure what these \"baby\" spiders are with any certainty. Most pictures used for identification of spiders are of adults, which usually have distinct characteristics. Baby spiderlings of many different species can look very similar, and there are very few photos of these stages for any spiders. Be that as it may, your photos give me some clues as to what this might be. The location and overall shape of the spider suggests this is a type of cobweb spider in the family Theridiidae. The photo of the underside shows a large reddish, vaguely hourglass shape which made me suspicious that this might be a \"widow\" spider in the genus Latrodectus. The brownish color, and the series of black \"eyespots\" on the top of the abdomen appear similar to what you might find on an adult brown widow, Latrodectus geometricus. There are lots of pictures of adult brown widows on the web but I only found one picture of brown widow spiderlings and it does seem similar to your \"spotted\" photo. Again, I can't absolutely be certain these are brown widow spiderlings or not, but that is my best guess at this point. Brown widows are known to be in California. Fortunately, unlike the black widow spider, rare bites from brown widow spiders are usually not considered to be medically significant. However, it might still be a good idea to remove these spiders or treat the area with a household insecticide. I have included some links below to websites with more information about this species.  http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/23403 https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latrodectus_geometricus http:\/\/www.spiders.us\/species\/filter\/california\/",

    "title-question":"Mammoth Russian Sunflower Leaves. Hi, and thank you for your time. I recently tried my hand at gardening from seeds and only one has survived, a Mammoth Russian sunflower plant, so I would very much like to see this plant bloom.  I sowed it in mid-July. It has made progress, and it's about 16 inches tall, but I noticed this week that the bottom leaves are drooping, and now I noticed the next pair up are starting to droop a little. The sprouting leaves on top still look healthy.  I noticed that the drooping leaves have ants on the underside and I found toothpick sized dots of orange and green underneath one of the leaves today, which I brushed off (and I removed the ants).  I don't think I over-water. I water when the soil looks dry, and I water with about 150mL. I should mentioned that this is a potted sunflower in a milk crate. I know that's not ideal, but I do know the plastic is food safe. I keep the plant on a chair in the backyard, and it gets full afternoon to evening sun. The plant hasn't been exposed to hot temps this summer (yet).  The leaves feel okay, except the bottom pair, which are isolated from the rest by a few inches. These two feel mushy in the way that a seedling does when they're damping off. I was thinking of pruning the pair.  I haven't fertilized the pot yet, but I planted with potting soil.  What would you recommend for my sunflower regarding the drooping leaves? Is it related to the ants and droplets? How much and often should I water?",

        "response":"Dear Gardener, Thank you for contacting us. The dots beneath the leaves could be honeydew secretions from insects if sticky. It is very common to have ants attracted to the honeydew. Regardless, I would suggest removing the two drooping leaves. Depending on how long it has been planted would determine if you should fertilize. Typically, potting soils have a quick start fertilizer that last a month or two. If you are past that mark you may apply a slow release granular product orincorporate water soluble when watering.For knowing when to water,check to see if the top inch of the potting mix is dry by inserting your index finger into the side of the container. If wet, wait to water; if dry, water! Let us know if you have any further questions.",

Brown widow eggs sacs are distinctively white or cream colored and have a spiked appearance (see links below to webpages with photos). After checking some photos of eggs sacs of other Theridiidae spiders, I found some that look similar to yours made by a smaller spider in the the genus Theridion (see link below). There are many species in this genus, and some are commonly found in houses. However, I didn't see any pictures of spiderlings in that genus that looked like your spiderlings.So, if your spiderlings did emerge from these, then they aren't brown widows. But they might still be brown widows and thatemerged from somewhere else. I am still only guessing as to what your spiderlings are, since there is no easy way to identify them until the get bigger. I hope you are successful in rearing one up, because now I am really curious as to what they might be.  http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/33348 http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/41275 http:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/1234233\/bgimage",

Most plants, including annuals, cannot tolerate a continuously wet or damp soil, so watering more less frequently is the better technique. Here's a short article on watering.Water in the morning, when there's less evaporation, and apply mulch to the top of the soil to retain water near the roots.Having said that, since you are in a dry part of the country, you might want to monitor the amount of moisture in the box. There is a 'free' measurer: your finger, inserted into the soil 2-3 inches (about the depth of most annual plants), and a slightly more expensive one (as cheap as $4) that you can buy at most garden outlets. Just don't let technology get you distracted from monitoring your plants: if they're drooping, (wilting) they need water.Good luck!",

The tomatoes you find in the store are bred to handle a lot of handling as the first priority and flavor as a second. Most folks a looking for that mild sweet flavor, not a tomato that can bite them back. Flavor is a product of genetics and environment. Some of the old heirloom varieties may be your best bet. Warmer weather may increase the flavor level, as well as denser leaf set on the plants. Really hot weather will cause the plants to set few if any tomatoes. Ideal temperatures are around 80 daytime and 55 nighttime. your daytime temperatures probably exceed that for a lot of the summerBonnie Plants tomato flavor page has more tips.California Extension has Heirloom Tomatoesand more",

In addition, it has survived moderately polluted wet areas. Sunset Magazine selected \"Tropicanna\" as one of the best plants for seaside gardens. Shelter it from the wind, they warn, to prevent shredding of the gorgeous foliage. The tropical lily is a natural to plant beside a pool or any water feature.\"Hope this helps!",

There is a lot of variability in leaf shape between these trees that made me suspect that maybe there were two separate plant species.  However, I remember visiting Bolboa Park in San Diego and taking some pictures of many of the fascinating trees found there.  Turns out that this tree is not native to the USA at all, but is native to Australia.  The trees I saw and photographed were called Flame Trees, Brachychiton populneus.  Also in the Park was Brachychiton discolor called a Queensland Lacebark and other Brachychiton species called Bottle Trees.  Just to make matters worse, there were a number of hybrids between these closely related trees.  I am afraid you are going to have to explore this genus of tree further to find the right species or hybrid that matches the leaves, flower, and seed pods.  I would start with these links to narrow down the field: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Brachychiton_populneus https:\/\/selectree.calpoly.edu\/tree-detail\/brachychiton-populneus http:\/\/tree-species.blogspot.com\/2008\/01\/lacebark-kurrajong-brachychiton.html Hope this helps!",

        "response":"This looks like a weed called Redroot pigweed, amaranthus retroflexus   This is one I have in my own garden. The weed is native to North America. It is a course erect annual that can reach 2 feet. The lower stems are often red or red striped with the color extending into the tap root. The leaves have long petioles and prominent veins. Redroot pig weed is widely distributed throughout the west, commonly found in cultivated lands, gardens and waste area. This weed reproduces by seed. Each plant can produce thousands of seeds. Most seeds are able to germinate immediately at maturity, allowing the plant to produce several generations per season. Those seeds that do not germinate at once can remain viable in the soil up to 10 years or more. Pigweed is drought tolerant and even thrives in hot temperatures. It colonizes and grows vigorously in bare, disturbed soil. There is also some evidence to suggest that the plant secretes chemicals that interfere with the growth of other nearby plants.    It is easy to pull. Frequent mowing and pulling will prevent seed production. The weed can be controlled with solarization (covering the area with black plastic). Also remove any plants that begin to flower, as the seed can even ripen when the plant is removed from the soil. Use mulch to prevent seeds already in the soil from germinating.   Native people have used redroot pigweed to treat a variety of medical conditions, and have commonly eaten the boiled young leaves as greens, and used the ground seeds in flour. Several types of wild birds also use redroot pigweed as a food source. However, pigweed accumulates toxic nitrates in its tissues, which are at their highest levels just before flowering. Therefore, it can be toxic to livestock.",

        "response":"In your area, depending on elevation, when the deciduous shrubs drop their leaves, will be about the best time to more it. Root prune now to prepare it for the actual digging and transplanting later in Nov-early March. Root pruning is the dig a trench around the plant as far out as you will make the root ball when lifting it. Be as generous as your back allows. Fill the trench with loose compost or mulch. Roots will grow into that trench to replace many of the cut roots before you do the actual move. Holly is not the most forgiving plant to transplant if it has been in the current location for quite awhile. Water it well after root pruning and mound mulch around it not touching the trunk. A planting at the very end of winter is more likely to succeed than earlier. Dig the new hole before digging up the plant. Do not fertilize the hole, but do amend it with compost dug in and thoroughly mixed with the native soil. When moving the holly, use a tarp or board to protect the root ball. If those roots get cracked, the chances of success drop.",

Hi, We've cleaned out an 'overgrowth jungle' in a small garden and have only left a 10-12 foot orange tree (6ft by 6ft treetop), and a 6 foot tall lemon tree. As I was digging and turning over the soil (mostly clay), I ran into a really long and thick root which has orangish skin. This orangish mystery\/unknown root is going around the orange tree and along the east fence and then underneath the southern fence. Root is about 3-4 feet outside the circumference of the treetop (it is 2 feet under ground where the thickest part of the root is, and about 3-5 inches under ground where it curves along the fence and where the root is starting to be thinner). [see 01_ garden diagram.jpg and 02_mystery root.jpg)  The big orangish root goes under a small brick wall and landing under which I cannot dig. Then the roots also appear on the north side of the landing and go towards the north fence and continue undeneath the neighbors fence.   If i dig around the orange tree those roots are close to the surface, much much thinner, look like a nest and they are yellowish in color. To me they look very different than the orangish mystery root that is in question [see 03_known orange tree roots.jpg].

From what I can tell from thelayout and where the root is thickest vs where it gets thin (it gets thinner and branches off as it gets to the south and north fences), it seems that some tree\/plant used to be right under where the landing is. If that is the case and this is a remnant from an old tree that was cut down, I'm a bit surprised that the root looks pretty fresh and alive. Is that possible even if the tree was cut down 20+ years ago when this house was built? The other possibility could be that those roots belong to one of the 2large trees from our neighbor's yard to the north. I've attached3 photos which shows their 45 foot large tree (and a closeup of this tree) and a20 foottree with a large\/wide treetop.  Couple of questions: - do you recognize what those 2 trees are and if the mystery orangish root on our side could belong to one of those 2 trees? - how long can I keep those roots exposed to air without covering them with dirt?

      {
        "response":"This appears to be a problem caused by a larvae group of skeletonizer caterpillars. The following is some general info that I hope is useful. On small trees, the best nonchemical control for these gregarious caterpillar species is to search the foliage for egg masses and tips of branches for colonies of larvae, then prune and destroy the infested leaves or twigs. This should be done early in the summer when populations are usually low since the initial infestations are found primarily on the lower branches.    A control technique that may be helpful is to till the ground thoroughly (if appropriate) in the immediate vicinity of the trunk in the fall. This will destroy some of the overwintering pupae.    For larger trees where it is impractical to search the foliage, chemical control may be required. Chemical applications should be made as soon as groups of larvae appear. Some insecticides that can provide control for these colony feeders are certain formulations of insecticidal soap, neem and Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Hope this helps!",

Look at an online image search for \"setaria pleated\" and you'll see the similarity. Another is a plant I grow, Bletilla, a hardy ground-orchid. I'm not sure either plant is likely to volunteer where it hasn't grown before. When you dig one of these up, what do you find? Are they all connected with roots? Or do they have bulbs?If you need to wait for them to bloom to identify them, I recommend you pot them so that the roots will not be running through your soil. If you need to destroy them, you'll be glad they are isolated in containers.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your insecticide question! There are (at least) 2 organic solutions for aphids. One is Neem oil which, in addition to killing insects, also kills fungi and mites. You can find it in any garden store; it's usually sold as 70% Neem oil, and you dilute it according to package directions. The second category is insecticidal soaps (also called horticultural soaps.)Unlike systemic insecticides, that get taken up through the plant's roots and become part of every plant cell (including the ones with pollen and nectar, which bees and other pollinators eat), these are both topical applications. Kind of like putting on an anti-itch cream rather than taking pills.They operate by suffocating the insects, mites and fungi (yes; fungi breathe just like we do!) The thing is, you need to spray them on the aphids\/mites\/fungi while they're wherever they are: leaves, buds, stems, etc. Once they dry, they are absolutely harmless to any other insect that lands and\/or feeds on the plant--including bees!Some people complain about Neem oil's smell. I find it refreshing, but to each his\/her own. You can smell it at the store and decide. (And it's not like you're going to spray it around your house!)There are two other options, by the way, both physical rather than chemical. One is just pinching a few; they squish easily. Science says the dying aphids emit a phermone (a smell) that other aphids can detect, and they know they're being attacked, so they jump off. Also, just spraying a strong jet of water to the affected areas will blast them off.Here's a link to a UC IPM (integrated pest management) article about aphid control that is far more expansive than my text.Good luck!",

Giving it more water once the scorch has started helps, but the brown won't turn green. You just have to wait until the new leaves come on next year.

        "response":"The lean is either by chance, by something shading it on the left, or by a prevailing wind from left to right. It doesn't have to be a strong wind, but a regular one during the growing season. If it is the former then you can pull several branches together vertical with a few winds of masking tape, snipping the terminal bud off of all but the one you want to be dominant. In a few years the tape will rot away and the new leader should be established. If shading just get rid of whatever is shading it. You can't overcome leans due to prevailing winds though.",

Although it is in a shady area and may have decided to just look for light. However, in San Francisco, I have noticed that a lot of newly planted young Gingko's are leaning at the top exactly like mine. So, I am inclined to say that this is \"just what it is doing\" and I cannot find anyone that knows why they are all leaning. I will follow your advice on creating a new leader and wondered if I should also prune out branches to open it up and give it shape; or should I create a new leader and leave everything else alone until it grows bigger.

Ten-fruit weights of the cultivars ranged from 6.6 to 9.2 g.   Fruit of Goertz and Robert had significantly greater 10-fruit   weights than that of Mission Red and Boughen Yellow. The   percent pit was lowest for the fruit of Goertz (9.4%) and highest   for that of Boughen Yellow (16%). The estimated percent   flesh ranged from 17.2 to 23.7%, and was 24% lower for fruit   of Boughen Yellow than the average of the remaining cultivars   which did not differ significantly from each other. Total   solids content did not differ significantly among the cultivars.   Fruit pH among the cultivars ranged from 3.86 to 4.25. The   pH of the fruit of Garrington was significantly greater than   that of Boughen Yellow, Copper Schubert, Mission Red and   Robert. Large significant differences among the cultivars   existed in the hue angle of the juice extracts, ranging from   34.6 to 88.2. So it seems the pH can vary greatly, so the addition of acid would be beneficial in jell formation in the event there is not as much acidity as needed.  Acidity will vary by season, maturity, location (this study was from Canada), and variety. For peaches, while the yellow has slightly more acid, it tastes more acidic because of the brix\/acid ratio.  The pH is slightly lower, but not significant.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The caterpillar looks like a saturniid (giant silk moth) from all of those spines. These can 'sting' or make your skin itchy at least if you handle it. If it's still alive, I would put it back where you found it and let it mature into what will probably bea beautiful and unique moth. As for the spider, I can't see enough of it to make an ID---if I knew what occurred in your county. For help with that, try your local Ag Commissioner's office or County Extension agent. Trying to feed a large spiny caterpillar to a little spider likely won't work. Replace the caterpillar with something small---like a cricket nymph or possibly a fly or two. The spider will likely create a web inits cage, catch its prey and feed on it in the web. Give the spider some 'natural materials' in its cage. A small amount of potting soil or clean sand might make a good surface for the occasional sprinkle of water; the spider will get most of its water from prey it catches. Have some screen on the top of the cage to prevent the spider from escaping; a 'vented lid' would work, too. When the cage looks dirty, clean it with a damp paper towel and replace the 'furniture' as needed with clean material. Replace the spider and go again. Chances are, the spider will only eat every few days---not 3 meals\/day like you have. Failure to provide 'moisture' in its habitat will kill it sooner than a lack of food. I hope this helps.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I too, am a coast redwood fan, but as with any tree species, roots can and will be an issue for gardens, septic systems and building foundations. The general rule of thumb says that you will have an \"issue\" at the tree's drip-line, an imaginary line drawn to the ground from the outter-most branches of the tree. Actually, the degree of root (how far they reach from the base of the tree) is species dependent. The poplar (cottonwood) is horrible in this context. Roots of poplars easily each 2 to 3 times the drip-line of the tree (a 20 foot drip-line can result in roots extending, 60, 70, 80 feet from the base of the tree. Conifers are maybe worst with ponderosa pine (distances roughly similar to poplar). Your redwoods are pretty aggressive \"rooters\" so in my opinion, I'd keep at least twice the drip-line distance for a garden. And of course, as the tree grows, so grows the area those roots will invade you. So you need to plan ahead and regardless of the tree, it will affect an area BEYOND the drip-line. And you can deal with some roots. It's not like they're killing your veges, but they are competing for the water and nutrients.",

If you have the spider captured in a container and can look on the underside of its abdomen, see if there is a orange or pinkish hourglass. From what I can see in your photograph, this may be a Brown Widow spider (Latrodectus geometricus), but, again, I can't see enough detail to be sure. The brown widow is in the same genus as the black widow, and its bite can pose a significant risk to humans.If you can safely check the underside of the abdomen, respond to this reply and let me know what you see.Jim",

Gently snap off the oldest flowers in a cluster to prevent seed heads from forming (picture 3), taking care not to remove any new buds in the process. Scissors will help you be more precise. When the last flower of a stem is spent, snip the entire stalk off at the base. This does not necessarily need to be done daily, but often.",

        "response":"I too, am a coast redwood fan, but as with any tree species, roots can and will be an issue for gardens, septic systems and building foundations. The general rule of thumb says that you will have an \"issue\" at the tree's drip-line, an imaginary line drawn to the ground from the outter-most branches of the tree. Actually, the degree of root (how far they reach from the base of the tree) is species dependent. The poplar (cottonwood) is horrible in this context. Roots of poplars easily each 2 to 3 times the drip-line of the tree (a 20 foot drip-line can result in roots extending, 60, 70, 80 feet from the base of the tree. Conifers are maybe worst with ponderosa pine (distances roughly similar to poplar). Your redwoods are pretty aggressive \"rooters\" so in my opinion, I'd keep at least twice the drip-line distance for a garden. And of course, as the tree grows, so grows the area those roots will invade you. So you need to plan ahead and regardless of the tree, it will affect an area BEYOND the drip-line. And you can deal with some roots. It's not like they're killing your veges, but they are competing for the water and nutrients.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Your tree is a Maytenus boaria. I don't know the tree, but it is a member of the Celastraceae family, which includes the shrub bittersweet. What you describe could be a disease called verticillium, which can kill part of the tree quickly. However, my guess is that the tree isn't getting enough water. What matters in irrigation is not so much how many times you water, but how much water is put down over how wide an area and how deep it goes. You should water it (in summer) every week or two but water an area at least as broad as the mature tree's canopy and at least two feet deep. So water less often but for a long time when you do.   No common diseases or insects exist between birches and mayten trees. However, underwatering can affect both similarly.   Read more here: http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/GARDEN\/PLANTS\/mayten.html",

THe bloom on mine is still developing , but as I recall, it will branch out and eventually produce pups on the stalk that look like tiny pineapples that will fall down onto the ground. I have never seen the blooms as the mother of this plant was already past that stage when I encountered it. It was growing apparently without assistance when I was out hiking somewhere. These things are hardy, I rarely take care of it. It sits in a boiling hot parking lot in a too small pot and grew very large, the pot is about to explode but it's so heavy now, i did not feel motivated to transplant (and it will probably die after this bloom so will not bother now). The bloom stalk grows about 6 inches a day! The color is green tones, not the grey or blue of some agaves.

Because it appears to be a young woody plant, I suspect its obtaining much of its energy from roots that remain in the ground after a tree was removed. If thats true, you will eventually have large  perhaps, very large  multi-stemmed tree unless you act soon.   In order to identify the plant, allow it to grow until its several feet tall and, then, take a branch about 15 inches long to a nearby large garden center because they are likely to know the common trees and shrubs in your county.    But if you want to get rid of it, act soon, using one of the following methods:   - Remove all top growth every time it grows to 6 inches tall; repeat if more growth appears.   - Dig out as much root as you can; repeat if any new growth appears - Or, if you prefer to use herbicide, cut off the green growth in the next month or so and, then, paint the cut surface of the stubs that remain with a weed killer containing the active ingredient triclopyr;repeat when new growth appears.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. Among arborists and horticulturists there has been much discussion about the use of pruning paints or wound sealers on trees.  To my understanding and from the training I have received, this is the summary:  Pruning paints and sealants generally offer zero benefit to trees and may in fact prevent healing or encourage rotting.  In Texas, there is one exception:  Pruning paint has been shown to offer some additional protection from a disease we call \"Oak Wilt.\"    Basically, Oak Wilt is a fungal disease spread by insects.  These insects are attracted to sweet smells or the smell of rotting fruit.  A fresh pruning cut or wound in a tree often has this smell.  By painting the cut immediately, we mask the smell of the wound, reducing the ability of the insect to find the wound and transfer disease spores.   Since I am in Texas, I am unsure what (if any) disease pressure you have in California.  For information specific to your area, I would contact the San Diego County Extension Office.  Their webpage is: http:\/\/cesandiego.ucanr.edu\/ The person to contact there appears to be Jennifer Pelham: jlpelham@ucanr.edu I was unable to find a phone number for her. She should be able to answer your questions. As for which \"mixture\" of paint is best to use, I've never heard anyone recommend mixing paint with water. To my knowledge, just about any type of paint or wound sealant will suffice. Again, remember, we just want to cover up the fresh wound and cover the smell of the fresh sap. All of the publications from universities that I read don't even address what type of paint to use. Most universities recommend simple latex paint. Buy the paint that is sold as wound sealer if it makes you feel better, but regular latex paint will work just fine. I hope this helps. Below is a study done here in Texas testing the efficacy of painting pruning cuts. Essentially, they saw some benefit from using pruning paint to prevent Oak Wilt infection, but the results were not statistically significant. There are many other similar guides and suggestions from universities that are available through a simple google search. Search things like \"pruning paint extension\" or \"pruning paint university\" or \"pruning paint California university\". Using this method, you are sure to get results that come from reputable sources, and not just any average joe who has an internet opinion on pruning trees.  http:\/\/www.texasoakwilt.org\/Documents\/Stewardship\/Pruning_Article.pdf Finally, research has shown that the method of pruning and location of the pruning cuts is far more important to tree health than pruning paints or sealers.Doagooglesearch for\"Shigopruning method\"and you will see the proper way to make pruning cuts. Information that comes from ISA (International Society of Arboriculture) is excellent and reliable. Thanks,",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your herb question. Short answer: it depends where you live, and I'm confused because you say Colorado Springs, but the identifier I'm seeing says California.Oregano: there are several herbs all called oregano, and the common ones are Greek oregano and wild marjoram oregano. Some can go down to USDA zone 4 to 5; others can't survive lower than zone 6. (You can plug in your zip code in this interactive mapto see what zone you're in.) Many oregano varieties can become invasive, so growing in pots or contained areas is recommended. A member of the mint family. (Bees love the plant!)Basil:  again, there are several basil herb cultivars, including globe, Thai, and holy. Also a member of the mint family.  Basil is not woody, and is treated as an annual throughout most of the country.Parsley: again, many different types, but most will survive in USDA Zones 6-9. Some cultivars will survive, depending on whether they're sheltered.Rosemary: a woody perennial, so should survive. And, like catnip, rosemary can spread. (Another plant bees love.)Chives: chives are a member of the alium family and grow from bulbs, like onions. The bulb collects sugars created in the chive leaves, and stores the food from year to year. Because the bulb is buried, it protects the plant, and chives are hardy to zones 3-9, so will probably come back year after year.Dill: dill will stay alive year round in zones 9 to 11 (really warm), and is an annual in zones 3 through 7. Here's a linkto a helpful article about dill. Hope you saved the seeds!As for mulching, you can rarely go wrong mulching the woody plants (oregano and rosemary) or the bulbs (chives.) It not only protects the roots, but, depending on the type of mulch, will add nutrients to the soil and protect the soil from getting compacted by rain and snow.Hope this is helpful!",

I can only guess from the pictures that these are mature trees. As such they need an annual application of nitrogen of about 6\/10 to 8\/10 lb of actual nitrogen per tree. Using a 13-13-13 fertilizer, as an example, they would need 4.6 to 6.2 lbs applied each spring and summer, divided into 2-3 applications. This will also supply needed Phosphorus and Potassium. Your fertilizer should also contain magnesium and micronutrients as well as N-P-K, and should be broadcast as a granular product throughout the area covered by tree limbs and 3-4 feet beyond.Fertilizer will only accomplish what it should do if the trees are also being watered properly. Mature citrus trees can withdraw 40 gallons of water per day in the summer when they have a crop, so your watering practices should address supplying 280 gallons of water per week during hot dry periods.Citrus trees thrive with good water and fertilizer. I suspect you need more inputs of both. You should also consider contacting the University of California cooperative extension system for their recommendations for citrus tree care that may take local soil, water and nutritional conditions into consideration.",

I have reached out to one of our Food Safety team members with UNH Extension and the short answer to your question is yes, you can add lemon juice directly to the jars and reprocess within 24 hours. Be sure to use a new lid. Jars and rings can be reused. Be sure to follow all of the proper steps as you would normally for preparing the lids in hot water as recommended by USDA.  \"The critical issue in canning safety is killing bacteria present in  the food to be canned or that have been introduced into the food during  its preparation. When the seal of the lid of a processed jar of food is  broken, ambient bacteria may enter the food.   Please see the  links below for USDA recommendations for the following: introduction to  canning tomatoes, crushed tomatoes (with no added liquid), whole or  halved tomatoes (packed in water), whole or halved tomatoes (packed in  tomato juice), as well as many other tomato preparations.  Food can be  re-canned within 24 hours if you discover the seal has been inadequate,  provided it is covered with a new treated lid and reprocessed for the  same processing time. That being the case, lemon juice could be added  per the client's query prior to re-closing with a new treated lid and  reprocessing as above, within 24 hours.\"  Can food be re-canned if the lid does not seal National Center for Home Food Preservation  Frequently Asked Canning Questions  'Tomatoes  also can have a natural pH above 4.6 (at least up to 4.8).  But rather  than develop a pressure-only process as if they were all low-acid, since  they are so close to 4.6, USDA decided instead to recommend a small  amount of acid be added so they can be treated as a food with a pH less  than 4.6 for home canning.  Therefore they are suitable for boiling  water canning when the acid is added.  (The commercial industry often  also adds citric acid to tomatoes to be able to give them a less severe  heat treatment than would be needed for botulism and other bacterial  controls.)'

      {
        "response":"Oranges and other thin-skinned citrus splitting prior to maturity is a physiological response to fluctuations in soil moisture. This problem is usually most prevalent in sandy, well-drained soils that do not retain moisture. When a tree experiences dry soil during the fruit enlargement phase, the fruit loses size and elasticity. Subsequent wet periods then can exert excess pressure on the fruit and splitting. This problem can be avoided by avoiding soil drying through regular irrigation throughout the fruit development period. Mulch can also stabilize soil moisture and help prevent soil drying. Provide appropriate mineral nutrition by fertilizing with complete fertilizers that contain micronutrients. Certain micronutrient deficiencies may also be involved with fruit splitting due the role they play in water translocation.",

    "answer":[

        "response":"You can relax; the spider is not a brown recluse, Loxosceles reclusa. Its a bit difficult to identify which spider is in your image because it appears to have been whacked, thereby distorting its shape. The marks on the top of the abdomen remind me of a jumping spider, but thats only a wild guess.   The good news is that the brown recluse is not in the LA, CA, area. Heres a nice image of the brown recluse which, as you can see, is far different than the spider in your image: http:\/\/spiders.ucr.edu\/brs.html. (Also notice the various informational links at the left of that page.)

        "response":"This question comes up surprisingly often. You don't say how big the cage is so I assume it is large enough for two snakes.  Can you keep them together? YES but a better question is should I? I do not recommend it. Part of good husbandry is making sure your snakes are dedicating regularly. With two snakes in the same cage you do not know if both are healthy until it's too late. If you decide to keep them together, take them out and feed them separately. Lastly, ball pythons are solitary animals in the wild and best to mimic that.",

I doknow that boron toxicity is an issue in certain California soils. The University of California will be able to provide youthe best solutions. I willtell you what I do know. Typically the boron in the BO3-3 form is available for plant uptake which can be only a small portion of the total boron level found in the soil.Much of the total soilboron presentis either highly insoluble or moderately soluble.The BO3-3 form tends to leach easily in low organic matter soils.Utilizing water to leach boron from the soil seems to be one of the options to lower soil boron levels. Boron ismore available inlower ph. soils and high organic matter soils.Low ph. and high organic matter is best suited for blueberry growth.  The addition of high levels of an acidic organic matter soil (pine bark, saw dust, etc.) may dilute thesoluble boron concentration enough, but I am not sure. Your best bet is to contact your nearest University of California Extension office.  I am not sure ofthe scope of your planting. If small, you may be able to manipulate the soil enough for blueberries to grow well. If not your high boron site may be more suitablefor cropmoretolerant to high boron levels.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. Spider identification, based on just a photograph can be very difficult. The Hobo spider is one that is particularly hard to identify by photo. The markings on hobo spiders are extremely variable, and the markings, when present, are very similar to a large number of other spider species. Also, the hobo spider's range does not currently extend into California.The hobo spider is a member of the funnel-web spiders, Agelenidae, although its web is generally not a funnel type web, but is usually constructed beneath an object. One of our other experts has suggested that your spider is probably one of the so-called grass spiders in the genus Agelenopsis, which has markings that are similar to those of the hobo spider.Here are some links to accurate information on the hobo spider:University of California Integrated Pest Management Program - Hobo spiderhttp:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn7488.htmlRod Crawford's Myth: How to recognize hobo spiders page at the Burke Museum in Seattle:http:\/\/www.burkemuseum.org\/blog\/myth-how-recognize-hobo-spidersHere's a link to information on Agelenopsis:http:\/\/www.spiders.us\/species\/agelenopsis-spp\/Hopethisanswersyourquestion, andthankyouforcontactingAsk anExpert.Jim",

I have not been able to find any articles indicating a fungal problem in California, but will share this excerpt from a resource that is not university-related:\"Root and Crown RotSeveral species of the Phytophthora fungi infect the crowns and roots of Cherry Laurel and other plants, causing the leaves to wilt, become discolored and prematurely drop from the tree. On the trunks, a vertical streak or canker is usually visible, and beneath the bark a brown or dark-grey discoloration may appear. Phytophthora infections can also cause black or reddish sap to ooze from infected bark. The infected twigs and branches eventually die back and the entire tree may die if the infection is severe enough. Phytophthora fungi require warm, moist soils to infect your tree. Good drainage and proper watering is the most effective way to prevent infection, but applications of fungicides containing fosetyl-al can also provide preventative control.\" It would seem that your area would be dry enough so that phytophthora fungi would not proliferate were they in the soil. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

I think USFS foresters in state and private forestry have done some trials on the injectables, but I am not exactly sure of the final results.Overall, once a tree is fully infected it is very hard to imagine how it can be brought back to health, and even then it may get attacked within a few decades.Bill",

    "title-question":"Forestry: Are tree injections effective vs. beetles in drought w\/o watering the trees? Dear Experts,Last drought season in CA Sierra resulted in many dried pine trees, and I look for any ways to minimize this next year.I've heard of \"trees injection\" with chemicals (\"pheromones\" or insecticides) used to preventpines' \"death\". However, I don't know whether this would work in drought conditions, without watering (which is hard to do in the forest, even if near property). Common sense might suggest that if the drying trees are \"on their last leg\" as is, then beetles infestation may be just one symptom of the root problem, rather than a key factor causing the issue.Also, this treatment is costly, and I'd really appreciate your advice on whether this would be effective in drought, without watering the trees in the first place.Thank you very much for your expert advice.Mike ",

        "response":"Drought conditions can severely alter the tree's ability to combat disease and insect attacks. The initial health of the tree is the 'key' to solving pest issues. Tree injections will help reduce specific insect infestations, but it all depends on that tree's health at the beginning of the problem - which some times goes unnoticed until it is too late for a remedy. Not knowing the tree species or the exact insect that is attacking your trees, it is hard to determine if an injection treatment is warranted.

        "response":"Thanks for your avocado plant\/tree question. Drooping leaves signal a problem with water--either too much or too little.  I can't see the soil surface clearly in your photos, but I'm also wondering if you have some sort of fungus growing there. (I can see the large white stones; it's the fuzzy white\/gray that I'm concerned about.)I would like to refer you to some academic article on the subject, but I can't find any. So I'm giving you a linkto a reliable (in my experience) website dealing with care, soil and watering issues. If you find a fungus, as this article explains, you can find an organic granular fungicide at your garden store or online.Another issue, although not addressed in this article, is the use of tap water for potted plants. There are often dissolved salts that build up (and have the same white\/gray look) in the soil. They can interfere with the plant's nutrient uptake, and cause plants to decline over time.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

        "response":"HelloI used to manage a research avocado nursery. Kristena LaMar is correctSuperficially, this tree looks like it is not getting enough water. There are a few possible reasons for this:1. The seed has finally withered and died so the plant has to survive on its own root system. This root system might not be healthy enough to sustain the plant.2. Tree not given enough water3. Tree given too much water - more common than you think. Avocados don't like wet feet. This results in the root suffocating and dying so the tree can't pull up enough water so look water stressed so people water more which drowns and kills the tree.I don't think it is salt burn, that results in the tips and margin of the leaves burning.Questions for you to answer:1. How much and how often do you water?2. Are the roots healthy? Scratch around the roots, if they are brown\/black they are dead. Avocado roots should be look like spaghetti.3. What is the potting mix made of? Cocopeat, composted pine bark? it looks very heavy which is not good for avocados.4. How wet is the potting mix? While you're looking at the roots, feel the mix, if it feels wet below the surface it is probably too wet. Let it dry out for a few days.",

It grows best in moist soils and will weaken over time if exposed to long hot droughts. I do not know about your watering restrictions in your area during the summer but this tree will decline if it does not get moisture as it does in its native range.

As this article (from the California Avocado Commission) explains, avocado trees require an enormous amount of water, unlike other trees. Plants may naturally go through 'shock' after a transplant, and I think yours has had this 'natural' phenomenon plus not enough water. I would not recommend putting plastic on or around the tree; it's a good way to kill beneficial microbes and promote harmful ones. Mulch will both help to keep water in the soil and eventually add nutrients for the tree's use.So, assuming drainage is adequate, water your tree until it its roots are established in the new area, lest your tree's leaves drop off, which is almost certain death.Good luck!",

Redwoods can get through dry summers fairly well (although they don't like a lot of heat), but they need a wet winter and spring. Drip irrigation would do almost nothing to satisfy their needs.A 60 foot tall redwood could easily use several hundred gallons of water a day. Compare that to the amount that you are adding with drip irrigation and I think that you will find that it is not nearly enough.",

I am relieved that it appears to be a lack of water problem - although i do not see the City of San Juan Capistrano allowing me to put 600 gallons a day on the trees. We are on very strict water restrictions. But now i am heartened that they may survive. The branches are still malleable and do not break like they are dead. I was hoping that 3 hoses on drip for 12 hours a day would penetrate down the 6' to the roots eventually..

        "response":"Thank you for your question.The symptoms expressed by this tree lead me to think it is related to drought and\/or excessive heat.  The fact that needles are dying from the tip as well as the branches indicates a lack of water availability, which could be caused by a number of factors, including drought, excessive heat, root disease, root feeding insects and others.  Frost could affect the tips of needles as well.  The fact that you have some new growth indicates the tree could still be alive.  Deep watering will help if drought is the issue. However, looking at a picture is not enough for a clear diagnosis.  I recommend you contact the University of California San Diego County Extension Office, link here, and see if someone can either come out and take a look or they might know a common condition and provide a local solution\/opinion. http:\/\/cesandiego.ucanr.edu\/cooperativeextension\/Contact_Us\/",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your question about composting.  Quite simply: use what you have!  The soil is filled with trillions of trillions of microbes that break down leaves (and all other organic matter) just by eating or dissolving them.  However, since they don't have big (or any 'mouths'), they need for the tissue to be as small as possible.  So, grinding or using a lawn mower, for example, to reduce the leaves to smaller sizes will allow the composting to be faster.  But, if you don't have something to do that, just bury the leaves, and keep moist.  (Some microbes, such as nematodes, protozoa and some bacteria, need moisture to live and move through the soil).  The only organic materials that should not be composted\/buried are weeds, seeds you do not want recurring, matter treated with pesticides and any plant that has poisonous or noxious characteristics.  That probably doesn't apply to your trellised plant leaves, but you might need that caution for other plants in your garden.  Hope this is helpful.  Good luck!",

Strawberry quality is a combination of appearance and flavor. . . Fruit that is harvested at full ripeness will have the highest sugar content and flavor. However, fruit is often harvested prior to full ripeness so that it is firm enough to be shipped. . . Strawberry fruit should be firm but not crunchy. Excessively ripe fruit can be too soft. (https:\/\/www.hort.purdue.edu\/prod_quality\/commodities\/strawberry.html) Even so, some commercial cultivars are more tasty than others.    On the other hand, strawberries grown and sold locally are entirely different varieties. The fruit can typically remain on the plant until fully ripe, are harvested daily, and will be sold the same day, perhaps at the farmers own fruit stand.",

    "answer":[

        "response":"Thanks for your question about your new artichoke plant. Yellow leaves are usually a sign of a lack of nitrogen, so it could be that the plant didn't get adequate fertilization at the nursery (or wherever you bought it from). Plant withering, though, typically is a sign of a lack of water, not just because it didn't get watering in the soil, but because the roots may have been surrounded by too much air, preventing the plant from taking up the water.So, in answer to your question, and assuming you left some leaves on the plant, it isn't the pruning of the plant that is causing the wilt, but perhaps you didn't make sure the soil is pushed down around the roots.Keep watering, give it some fertilizer (organic preferred) and sun, and keep your fingers crossed. Here's a linkto a pretty good article about growing artichokes. Hope it's helpful.Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your question about your roses.  Since the photos are taken from a distance, it is difficult to see the leaves clearly.  The sick ones appearvto have yellowing (chlorotic) leaves, with many of them curled.  This can be evidence of aphids, which deplete chlorophyll from the leaves.  Are you able to examine the plants close up and look for small, soft, white insects?  Other causes of chlorosis include not enough nitrogen in the soil, from over-watering or lack of fertilization.  You should pull the mulch away from the plants at least 6 inches, since it's know to draw nitrogen out of the soil, especially in the first 6 months after application.  If you find no insects, please take a closeup picture of leaves and branches, and re-submit.  Thank you.",

        "response":"No aphid, no evidence of bugs. Here are close ups, with my finger for size reference. We bought this house last fall, was professionally landscaped when we bought it. There are 25-30 roses total, all the sick ones are adjacent to each other, in same area of yard. All are on drip. I've used 3-in-1 systemic, last year, and again this spring. These same roses looked like this at the end of last year (before pruning) so it's not a new problem. Unrelated, but another roses problem: powdery mildew. We live 2 blocks from the beach, sometimes it's foggy. Systemic doesn't seem to prevent it. Any suggestions for a remedy? Thx so much.",

      {
        "response":"Thank you!  I have shut my computer down, and can't attach links from my ipad, so will research further tomorrow, when I can view your photos better.  As to powdery mildew, this is a fungus whose spores are aitborne.  When they land on a moist surface, they grow and deplete the leaves of chlorophyll.  Organic fungicides, such as neem oil, essentially suffocate them (fungi breathe as we do).  Follow label directions, and don't apply when pollinators are 'out,' since it will kill them (as well as mites) in the same fashion.  The problem with systemics is that they become a part of every cell of the plant--including pollen and nectar, which bees etc. consume.  There's evidence that's what contributing to their demise.  More tomorrow....",

        "response":"Thanks again. Leaf curling (and yellowing leaves) can come from a variety of sources. This articlegive you a number of potential reasons.  The type of pathogen for roses that is described here would seem to be rose-leaf curl. Viruses of several different types (some prevalent in California roses) are spread by a variety of insects, and which \"infect cells, changing some cell functions.\"  I suggest you read the article explained in thisLink; as it says, it's not \"life-threatening to the rose, just unsightly.\"I hope these resources are helpful to you.

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. It can be difficult to identify a spider based on a photograph alone, because characteristic features you need to observe to ensure a positive identification aren't usually visible in the average photograph.I believe this is one of the jumping spiders, possibly the bold jumper (Phidippus audax). This species is one of the larger jumping spiders. The chelicerae, which are the principal mouthparts consisting of a base and a movable fang, are iridescent green. Sometimes it's difficult to see this, depending on how the light hits the spider. This species is most common from New England and Ontario, west to South Dakota and Colorado, and south to New Mexico and Florida. However, this species has been introduced into southern California. This species can be found outside in fields, prairies, gardens and low-growing vegetation in forested habitats. They can also be found in houses.They are active hunters, and do not build webs to capture their prey. They have excellent eyesight, and depend on their vision to capture their prey. Here's a link to a video on a study recently completed at Cornell University on the vision of jumping spiders:http:\/\/www.cornell.edu\/video\/vision-in-jumping-spidersThis same group of scientists also determined that jumping spiders can detect sound at certain frequencies. The video of the discussion of that study can be found here:http:\/\/www.cornell.edu\/video\/jumping-spider-hearingThe University of California at Irvine has a website featuring the spiders of Orange County. If you scroll down to the jumping spiders and select Phidippus audax, you can see a collection of photographs that show the variability of color in this species, and there are a few that look very similar to your photograph.http:\/\/mamba.bio.uci.edu\/~pjbryant\/biodiv\/spiders\/Like most spiders, the jumping spiders are venomous, but they do not pose a risk to humans.Theygenerallydon'tbiteyouunlessyouprovokethem.Unlessyou happentobeallergictotheirvenom,youmayexperiencesomerednessatthesiteofthebiteandsomesoreness,butafteracoupleofdaysthere'susuallyno sign ofthebite.Hope this answers your question, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

      {
        "response":"Dear Client, I would suggest that if you still have this spider or even a dead body, that you resubmit digital images.  To help us properly identify this spider we need to know or see the following character.   1)over all body size (with and without legs) 2)close-up of the eye arrangement (spiders can have six to eight eyes but the eyes were not visible in your image); 3) close up of mandibles (do this move up and down or side to side; the mandibles were shadowed in your image); 4) close up of the \"tail pipes\" or the appendages at the back end of the spider.  My best guess is that your spider is one of the Mygalomorphs (Mygalomorphae)based on the size and the appearance of a sclerite or plate on the front and topof the abdomen. This group contains spiders such as the folding-door and the trap door spiders.  Sorry we can't provide you with a more solid identification, but the key characters are just not visible in your digital image submitted.",

      {
        "response":"It it difficult, if not impossible to diagnose a critter based on the appearance of the bite. Even one that appears to be obvious (brown recluse spider for example), isn't that easily diagnosed and can be confused with other problems, including infections. The primarily reason for this is that each person reacts differently to arthropod bites\/stings. One person may react to a sting with very little pain and\/or swelling; where someone else reacts with extreme pain, warm\/hot swelling, and even breathing problems.  I don't think your white spot contains venom. I have never read anything to suggest such a possibility. The white spot is more likely your body's reaction to the original sting. The work you did may have re-aggravated the original injury and thus the swelling reaction. We are now getting close to medical opinions and I am not qualified to go further.  For more details about the critters in your area that are capable of causing such a sting reaction, I suggest that you contact your local extension office.

        "response":"Thank you for your question about your marigold. Plants that produce flowers need sunlight; it takes a lot of photosynthesis to produce the organs that generate flowers and then seeds. I'm suspecting that the indoor lighting--even though upon a window ledge--is not sufficient for flowering.You might also check the fertilizer you're feeding it. The three major nutrients have numbers on the fertilizer containers: 10-10-10, for example, means 10% nitrogen, 10% phosphorus and 10% potassium. Nitrogen is for the green leaves; phosphorus is for the roots, and potassium is for the flowers (and then seeds.) Perhaps the fertilizer you are using is heavy on the nitrogen (10-2-5, for example), and your plant is underfertilized.But even the right 'mix' of fertilizer won't make up for adequate sunlight. See what happens if you use flower fertilizer, and set it outside.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

        "response":"Thank you for attaching the image of your maple leaves. At this time, the leaves look healthy. Fresh new leaves are often reddish, but this does depend upon which kind it is. (Because theres been nearly a weeks delay before I was assigned your inquiry, perhaps theyre green now?)    Other possible reasons for the reddish, downward-facing leaves:   - The image reveals that the leaves are partially expanded; new leaves will gradually acquire their normal orientation as they expand.    - If this tree is a different kind than the 2 with green leaves, the color may be entirely normal.    - If all 3 trees are supposed to be the same kind, perhaps the original name tag on this tree was misplaced. This can occur even if all 3 trees were obtained from the same source and were purchased at the same time. (Unfortunately, shoppers sometimes return a label to the wrong pot.)    A final note: If the tree proves to be unhealthy, and the seller guarantees their plant material; plus you have the required proof(s) of purchase; request a replacement before the deadline.",

However, there are two insects that are used in the Great Plains: the bindweed moth (Tyta luctuosa) was released in Arizona, Iowa, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Texas and the bindweed gall mite (Aceria malherbae) was released in Texas. Registration of these insects in California is uncertain. Perhaps if you contact them directly they could provide you with more information. Their contact information is at http:\/\/www.cdfa.ca.gov\/contact_us.htmlfrom Susan F - Delaware Master Gardener Replied July 31, 2015, 2:49 AM PDT Release and Colonization of the Bindweed Gall Mite, Aceria malherbae: A Field Bindweed Biological Control Program for the Texas High Plains G. J. MICHELS, D. A. FRITTS, and J. B. BIBLE Texas Agricultural Experiment Station, 2301 Experiment Station Road, Bushland, Texas 79012, USA Aceria malherbae Nuzzaci is a gall-forming eriophyid mite imported from Greece for biocontrol of field bindweed. The mite injures plants by producing galls on leaves, petioles, stems and roots. Infested plants are yellowed, have deformed leaves, reduced vigor, and new growth is killed. The mites can kill whole plants, limit seed production and reduce vegetative spread. A. malherbae overwinters on the roots of bindweed, and is present in the spring when bindweed growth begins, where it can quickly build up and suppress new growth. After an initial quarantine period at the USDA-ARS Insect Quarantine Facility at Temple, TX, A. malherbae was released at Bushland, TX, in 1989. Approximately 5,800 mites were released in May and 9,000 mites were released in June. By June 1992, 52% of the bindweed crowns at the release site were infested with mites and the mites had moved 9.5 m from the release site. By July 1996, mites had spread over one km from the release site and reduced the bindweed infestation by 50%. Mites have spread at a rate of about 0.125 km\/yr. In 1998, a program was initiated at the US Department of Energys Pantex plant in Amarillo, TX, to redistribute the mite within the confines of this installation. Initial success has been excellent. The release sites in 1998 were inadvertently mowed; however, this accident proved to be beneficial. Over a period of 83 days, the mites moved 60-164m (0.73-2m\/day) from the point of release at the mowed sites. In contrast, the natural movement at the Bushland release site averaged 0.35m\/day. In essence, the mites dispersal was increased by 2-6x at the mowed sites. It is thought that since the mites are so small, mite-infested bindweed clippings act as good host material for distribution. Releases, redistribution, and monitoring will continue throughout 1999.    It would be best to contact the Cooperative Extension Office for Humboldt County who can advise you about controlling bindweed on your farm.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. The introduction of another snake to its tank may very well be the reason your boa is not eating. Unless they are mating, or in some species, hibernating, snakes are not social animals. They spend the majority of their time alone. Placing them together can cause stress, which can certainly result in their refusing food. In addition, elevated stress levels can make snakes more susceptible to various types of diseases. Also, placing a live rat in cage with your snake can be dangerous for the snake. If the snake doesn't immediately catch and kill the rat, and the live rat is left to roam around the tank, it may start chewing on the snake. This can result in serious wounds that can become infected, resulting in the death of the snake. It's best to feed pre-killed rodents. If the snake doesn't eat immediately, then you don't have to worry about the rodent injuring the snake.I recommend that you place the snakes in separate tanks with suitable temperature, humidity and a place to hide, wait a few days, and then try offering the food again. If the snake continues to refuse food, you should contact a reptile veterinarian, because there may be other issues that are causing the snake to stop eating.Hope this answers your question, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"I agree you have several things going on with your blueberries. 1. The holes in the leaves and the leaves that have the transparent brown sections in middle have been fed on by leaf miners. They may be responsible for some of the black bits on the other leaves also. On a couple leaves there is something small and brown, maybe an aphid? For now I would manually remove any insects and consider an insecticide treatment post harvest if needed. 2. Some of the leaf discoloration seems to indicate nutrient deficiency. The reddening leaves may indicate Magnesium deficiency. You can apply Epsom Salt at a rate of 3 ounces per plant to correct for this. 3. There may be some fungal disease also. In Georgia, I would recommend Serenade Max or Captan to be appliedfor the leaf disease. Are the leaves with the discolorations from this year's growing season or last years? If they are last year's leaves, I wouldn't be too concerned. If the discolored leaves are from this year, you may need to change your fertilization program some.Fertilize products thatare recommended for Azaleas will typically work well forBlueberry plants  ",

This tree would also benefit from judicious pruning for shaping during these years. Have you had a soil test run?  Another condition that you could also check out is the fact that these trees need full sun (6 + hours ) per day. You could also try aeration of the soil to help oxygenate the soil for the roots.

Soil aeration is when you go through the lawn with a rotary pronged tool that loosens the thatch around the roots of the grass plants. I believe that this is still necessary for your lawn but because of the clay soil you should take anotherstep of getting oxygen to the roots. This method is boring holes into the roots zone by using a stake of maybe 1 inch in circumference and pounding it into the soil at 5 to 7 inches deep. There should be 7 to 10 of these holes which eventually should be filled with composted manure and then watered in. This process then gets oxygen as well as other nutrients to the roots of the tree. You might also try mowing your lawn at 3 to 4 inches tall rather than the urban ideal of 1 to 2 inches. This helps keep moisture around the roots of the grass plant as well.

So I would advise leaving the snake alone so it eats the rats which are a bigger concern. When the rodents are gone the snake will move on in search of food",

        "response":"Since mold spores and their food sources are everywhere, the only real control we have is moisture management. The Master Gardener guide has some tips for snow mold.In it, it talks about soil alkalinity and, poor drainage, and poor air movement being key factors to growing mold, algae, moss, and lichens on the ground, grass and landscape components. For the stones and cement, scrape off what you can and then wash with a good cleaner, like those recommended for cleaning the home exterior. A good push broom may help provide the scrubbing action needed.A more permanent solution would include actions that open up the landscape to allow more air movement. Like trimming trees and bushes or removing some to let more sunlight in.",

Physical, biological and chemical control options are detailed at the bottom of the page. As the article says, removing it physically is best done when the soil is wet. I'm afraid I can't predict how stressed you'll get, because I don't know the extent of the plant, nor anything about your physical condition. Although there undoubtedly are weed removal companies, you could probably hire some soon-to-be-released school kids who, with appropriate protective gear, could get it out in a day.Hope this is helpful.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The insects that are orange with black spots in your images are lady bird beetles (aka ladybugs). The close up is the exoskeleton (outer skin) of one of these beetles. These are GOOD bugs - they eat bugs that attack your plants, they will not damage your plants. These lady bird beetles are on your ocatillo because there are other bugs there that are attaching your plant (probably aphids but I cannot tell from the picture). Since the lady bird beetle predators have already arrived (and there are probably several other predatory insects that are also attacking the aphids), I would leave the plants and bugs alone to let nature do what it does best - natural control of the system. If you apply a pesticide, you are likely to have a greater effect on the aphid predators than on the aphids that you want to control. With all the rains this year, we simply had a bumper crop of many pests - this is likely a natural cycle, just one that we have not seen in a while. If you are worried that the aphids (or whatever the plant attacking insects are) will actually kill your ocatillo or other plants, you might consider contacting a UC Master Gardner for more information on risk of plant death.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Wood chip mulches are useful in landscapes for various reasons, among them that they provide a coarse-textured insulation that protects the soil and root systems from temperature extremes while allowing air and moisture (rainfall and irrigation) to penetrate. Such mulches are typically applied as a 3- to 4-inch deep layer.    Because the affected plants were installed recently, my best guess is that the follow-up care may be lacking. This often relates to water, either excessive or insufficient amounts. Its very likely that the rootballs are dry.    Adequate moisture is critical to survival early on, even for plants that are considered drought-tolerant.  Put differently, woody plants (trees and shrubs) must be irrigated on a regular basis for the first 2 years, gradually reducing the frequency to what is normal for that plant.   We can explore this issue further if you attach images of the affected plants as well as their surroundings. (You can add up to 3 images per reply.)     Please include as much information as possible about the kinds of plants and their size when installed; how they were planted; the prevailing weather since installation; and follow-up care.

During summer we had very small minor bugs trying to enter here and there which is totally normal, however, this summer I found a bunch of these weird looking flies on my floor near the window. I then found more on my window and curtain and then some in the inside. They all seemed dead and o my found maybe 2 alive. My dad sprayed them with the big spray but every time we cleaned them out more came the next day. Then we bought a very strong bug spray and sprayed it everywhere in my room. After about 3 days we saw no more bugs. I thought I was free, until today when is we them again! It's rediculous. They have very weak wings, most of their wings fall of easily. And the thing is, it's only my room they enter. Not my sisters which is right next to me. I thought it might be good problem but if it was a good problem my sisters room would have bugs not mine considereing her room is always packed with candy and food everywhere. These are what they look like. My question is, what kind of bugs are these and how can I keep them out? We're fixing the window shield that's meant to keep bugs out when you open the window. However I always keep my window closed so that still can't be the problem. Any answers and suggestions would be very appreciated and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this!

    "question":"Hello, my family and I moved to a new house about 2 years ago. During summer we had very small minor bugs trying to enter here and there which is totally normal, however, this summer I found a bunch of these weird looking flies on my floor near the window. I then found more on my window and curtain and then some in the inside. They all seemed dead and o my found maybe 2 alive. My dad sprayed them with the big spray but every time we cleaned them out more came the next day. Then we bought a very strong bug spray and sprayed it everywhere in my room. After about 3 days we saw no more bugs. I thought I was free, until today when is we them again! It's rediculous. They have very weak wings, most of their wings fall of easily. And the thing is, it's only my room they enter. Not my sisters which is right next to me. I thought it might be good problem but if it was a good problem my sisters room would have bugs not mine considereing her room is always packed with candy and food everywhere. These are what they look like. My question is, what kind of bugs are these and how can I keep them out? We're fixing the window shield that's meant to keep bugs out when you open the window. However I always keep my window closed so that still can't be the problem. Any answers and suggestions would be very appreciated and helpful. Thank you for taking the time to read all of this! I hope no one else encounters these guys",

        "response":"You seem to have a termite infestation. Your pictures are not very good, but these seem to be winged termite reproductives. At this time of the year, termite swarms will occur. Males and females fly our of their nest and mate to form new nests. Have you observed any of these without wings, and paired, with one (male) following the other (females)? Take a look at this website: http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn7415.htmlTermite swarms inside the house may be an indication that there is a infestation in the house. The reason why they would be in your room and nowhere else in the house may be due to where the infestation (nest) is located.Take some of the specimens to you local County Extension Office or Cooperative Extension Office and they should be able to tell exactly what these are. Termite infestation are hard to control and can be costly in some cases. You may  want to contact a pest control company to take a look at the problem.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"One thing which can cause yellowing of apple tree leaves is water stress  http:\/\/articles.extension.org\/pages\/60228\/effect-of-water-on-apple-trees:-not-enough-or-too-much) but the isolated pattern I saw in your pictures does not indicate water damage. You dont say how long you have had this tree.  If your apple tree is young and was recently transplanted, it could be experiencing a common problem known as transplant shock. Leaf scorch, or the bronzing and browning of leaves, is among the most common symptoms of transplant shock. When planting an apple tree, the soil needs to be loose and workable for an area approximately three times wider than the root ball to allow the roots to grow. Girdled roots can cause leaf symptoms. Where is your tree planted? Is it in a lot of wind? Another cause for browning leaves may be wind scorch, which occurs when the leaves receive too much wind or salt without appropriate water. You said you thought it might be fungal.  The most common fungal disorder of apple trees is apple scab, caused by Venturia inaequalis. Apple scab's first symptom is yellow and brown spotting of the leaves, which develops into dark, olive-brown spots on leaves and fruits. The spots can be quite large and cover most of the leaves' surfaces. I could not tell from your pictures but it did not appear to be apple scab as I did not observe spots.  That said, severe infestations cause complete yellowing and dropping of large sections of leaves which you did appear to have. It will not kill your tree, your fruit may be ugly but just peeling it and using it is fine.  This disease overwinters on fallen, infected leaves. Raking and destroying -- burning or burying -- infected leaves can prevent future infections. Another fungal disorder of apple trees is cedar-apple rust.  You mentioned that you thought your apple might be sick due to a nearby tree.  This fungus requires both Eastern red cedar, and apple trees to complete its life cycle. For either fungus, Id apply a ready-to-use organic fungicide every seven to 10 days during the new-growth season and when the disease is prevalent. To apply, spray both sides of the leaves until thoroughly wet.  I prefer organics when the food is to be consumer although there are others on the market.",

        "response":"Hello again.  I heard back from my contact, and she said your snake should have a postlaying shed approximately 10  14 days from the date she laid her eggs. Once she has shed, she should be interested in food again. You might consider feeding her small er mice at first. If she takes those, then you can work your way back up to full size mice with subsequent feedings.   She also said you should always be concerned about retained eggs, especially following an infertile clutch. She provided the following method for checking:   To check, place a light weight cloth (such as a handkerchief) over one hand, while holding the snake. Let it SLOWLY crawl back into the cage while gliding over the hand with the cloth on it. As it moves, gently probe your forefinger into the rear half of the snakes belly. It is important that the snake is relaxed, not tense. If there are retained eggs, you should be able to feel the bumps. Do it more than once, with the snake relaxed and moving slowly, if you are not sure of the results.   She provides methods for removing retained eggs in her book:   Love, Kathy and Love, Bill. (2005). Corn Snakes  The Comprehensive Owners Guide. Irvine: Advanced Vivarium Systems.   however, if youre not familiar with advance techniques working with snakes, I recommend that if you suspect your snake may have retained eggs then consult with a reptile veterinarian. If you dont already have a vet, there are several sites online where you can search for reptile vets by city or county. If there is a state or local herpetology club near you, they often know who the best vets are in your area.   Hope this information helps, and thank you for using Ask an Expert.   Jim ",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thanks for your question about foraging for juniper berries. First, let me refer you to an article that is somewhat outdated (1995) about the Western Juniper plant, which has a B\/W map showing the range known at that time. Wiki (not a scientific source, but more updated) has another map, and describes the two varieties\/subspecies. (You might be interested in an environmental perspective from 2013, as well.) You may have a knowledgeable handle on the types of junipers available for consumption, but, if not, you might want to read this.As for finding ripe berries (cones), here's an excerpt from the 1995 article, above: \"The female cones begin to develop in the spring, and by summer theyve reached their mature size, although it will be another year or more before they drop. The mature cone consists of a glaucous (covered by a waxy coating), deep blue, berry-like structure that contains two or three seeds enclosed in a resinous pulp.\"Finally, as to legality of harvesting. If the trees are located on private property, you'd need to get the permission of the landowner. If it is national forest land, you should contact the Forest Service office(s) in or near the forest, each of which has a website(for the Deschutes National Forest) or this onefor the Mt. Hood National Forest, or thisfor Mt. Shasta.  You can go to a state's website to look for rules and permits for state parklands. I don't know if this posthas been updated since its first publication, but it's a fair stepping off point.Hope these are helpful. Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Tomato plants require even moisture in the soil to prevent cracking and fruit drop.    Even soil moisture is achieved by a combination of watering and mulch.     Mulch will prevent soil water evaporation so the water in the soil is available for the plant between watering. Use bark mulch or straw. Both are good. Mulch also prevents splashing soil onto plant which prevents damage, increases water infiltration, and eventually breaks down into soil nutrients.    Cracking of tomatoes occurs when there is not enough water in the soil. The tomato expands into a fruit so fast, cracking occurs if the plant cannot bring enough water up from the soil.    Blossom end rot is another problem that can occur from poor soil moisture. Blossom end rot occurs when there is not soil moisture to carry calcium up into the plant. Nutrients and minerals essential for plant growth and fruit production are absorbed from the soil with water.",

        "response":"To whom it may concern, All spiders are venomous. With that said, however, the only spiders capable of inflicting a medically important bite in California are the Lactrodectus widow spiders. The spider in your image appears to belong to the Agelenidae (grass spiders) or Oxyopidae (lynx spiders). You can submit your specimen to the UCCE Master Gardner Help Desk program in your county for positive identification, if you like: http:\/\/smsf-mastergardeners.ucanr.edu\/Advice_to_Grow_By\/ For more information on spiders in the SF Bay Area, and to try to identify your specimen yourself, please visit the following web pages: http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn7442.html http:\/\/mamba.bio.uci.edu\/~pjbryant\/biodiv\/spiders\/ Keep in mind that it is impossible to identify biting arthropods (insects and spiders) from dermal symptoms alone (i.e. your 'bite'). Such dermal irritations can be caused by many environmental irritants and should not be automatically considered 'bites'. Spiders have no business biting people in their bedrooms. Verified bites happen when wandering spiders become tangled in clothing or bedsheets and bite defensively when pressed against body parts. Best regards, Andrew",

I think you are likely looking at black rot  a fungal disease http:\/\/http:\/\/www.extension.umn.edu\/garden\/yard-garden\/fruit\/apple-pest-management\/black-rot\/ Cankers which probably caused the diagnosis of oyster shell scale (Oyster shell scale would not necessarily blacken the tree http:\/\/ento.psu.edu\/extension\/factsheets\/oystershell-scale) appear as a sunken, reddish brown area on infected limbs often with rough looking or cracked bark. You can spray with a fungicide after removing all infected areas but from the looks of your tree I would say it is probably not salvageable.          A blackened trunk is often a sign of fireblight, a bacterial disease of apple trees. You should be seeing other signs such as shoots that are infected turn green gray not black and bend over forming a shepherds crook. Infected leaves start out green gray, then turn brown around the edges and eventually turn completely brown and wilted. Blighted leaves remain attached to the tree throughout the season and into winter. Branches dying with a torched look is the most common If many branches of the tree have been infected, it may appear to have been scorched by fire, giving the disease its name. http:\/\/www.extension.umn.edu\/garden\/yard-garden\/fruit\/apple-pest-management\/fire-blight\/",

Pepper plants don't like it too hot or too cold. They prefer to bebelow 68 at night and below 86 during the day. In really hot weather peppers will often drop their blossoms altogether and pollination may be poor.

        "response":"Thanks for your question. I'm not sure if you're asking why the leaves are dropping off, or whether there is some sort of sticky substance dropping from the leaves.  If your question is the former, here's a linkto an article explaining why this happens at this time of year. If your question is the latter, here's a lengthier articleexplaining leaf spot diseases. Although various commercial tree treatment companies advertise injections for leaf scab, diplodia tip blight, anthracnose, sooty mold, rust, and phytophthora, you wouldn't want to spend the money on such an injection until and unless you first determined what your plant 'has.' I can find no scientific studies of the benefits of trunk injections.Good luck!",

    "title-question":"What are examples of Surfactants? I raise Monarch butterflies from eggs, and am always concerned about any treatment used on milkweed plants that the Monarch caterpillars devour. The one part I can't quite find specific information on is the Surfactant ingredient. I understand how it works and why it is used. But I can't seem to find what that surfactant is in pesticides, herbicides, and some other plant treatments.  Even though it may be an 'organic' surfactant, it can still kill the Monarch Caterpillars within a few bites. So even the oleander aphids must be smooshed by hand and rinsed off with water. (you can tell someone does this by the almost permanent stain on their forefinger and thumb) I also realize that each pesticide product may have different surfactants.  And then of course, because I now know the word in context of pesticides, and Monarchs, I see the word all over the place. We always recommend thoroughly washing one's hands before and after working with Monarch caterpillars &amp; milkweed.  But now, I'm thinking of adding that you must rinse your hands really well before working with the Monarch caterpillars.   Help??

        "response":"I'm not totally sure of what you are asking? What an example of a surfactant is? Or for suggestions on surfactants to perhaps use for aphid management? Or if all surfactants - natural or synthetic - might be harmful to monarch caterpillars? Most pesticides (particularly liquids) will contain some type of surfactant to assist in mixing, spreading on\/sticking to (the leaf surface), enabling movement into the leaf, etc. These are often proprietary (i.e., secret?) in nature, so you just can't generally talk about surfactants as if they are all the same across pesticide products.As for the potential to harm caterpillars, I would think (but have no science to support this opinion) that most surfactants - BOTH natural\/organic or synthetic - could harm caterpillars that consume the surfactant. Your approach to managing the aphids is the safest one - but time-consuming.If I have misunderstood your question, please clarify and I will try again!Thanks!tony",

        "response":"Tony, Thank you your reply. Ironically, this one 'ingredient' is so allusive; so far I haven't found anything on what makes up a surfactant. I found a surfactant in my kitchen~my dish soap. Which is not to be used on milkweed because it will kill monarch caterpillars. You said \"not totally sure of what you are asking? What an example of a surfactant is? Or for suggestions on surfactants to perhaps use for aphid management?\"... An example of a surfactant would be great. That might give me enough of an idea of what is in a surfactant. In researching this, I end up following one lead after another. It seems a lot of surfactants are some form of salt, with some type of fatty alcohol. But I realize the make up of surfactant is far more complex than that. My concern is so many nurseries think the surfactant isn't a problem, and altho they may list it in chemical or organic pesticides, they don't pay attention to it, and it kills our Monarch caterpillars. I'll keep looking. Thank you so much!",

The state varies tremendously from one location to another in first and last frost dates, mostly due to elevation. It can freeze in Jackson, for example, in late July; in Powell the typical last date is the end of May. Good information can be found here: http:\/\/www.wrds.uwyo.edu\/sco\/climateatlas\/temperature.html#31First hard frost here in Laramie (7200 feet elevation) is usually the first week or two of September; last hard frost is usually the end of May. We don't plant annuals outdoors until the first week of June. Contrast that with lower elevations such as Sheridan, Torrington, and Powell: first frost usually mid-September and last frost mid-May.Summers at higher elevations will reach 80F in mid-June and exceed 80s in July and early August. Lower elevations will hit 80s early June, often through the end of August.Location, location, location!Let me know if you need more information.Karen P.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. I don't think placing the heating pad on the side of the aquarium is a good idea. If it made the glass too hot when it was at the bottom of the tank, placing it on the side could make the side glass too hot as well. Depending on the temperature of the glass, it could burn your snake if it makes contact with the glass.Overhead heat lamps can provide enough heat to raise the cage temperature to a suitable range for your snake, so it can regulate its internal temperature and properly digest its food. If use of overhead heating is not an option, a radiant heat panel may be a good option for you. Radiant heat panels actually warm the animal not the surrounding air. They also don't produce any light, so if you're trying to provide warmth without lighting up your room, these panels may be an ideal solution for you.Here's a link to a good article on heating and cooling reptile and amphibian enclosures that was published in Reptiles Magazine that discuss radiant heat panels, as well as other possible options:http:\/\/www.reptilesmagazine.com\/Reptile-Health\/Habitats-Care\/Heating-And-Cooling-Reptiles-And-Amphib...Corn snakes generally require a temperature range from 85 degrees Fahrenheit for a maximum to the low 70's for a minimum.

It's been 8 months of having the vaccinated birds and so far, no more losses.My question relates to vaccinated chicks that I'm currently brooding in my living room. Marek's is like a boogey-man lurking at every turn. I have a VERY small house, so I've kept \"clean-room\" protocol in place to protect the new babies while their vaccines allow their bodies to build resistance. I also re-vaccinated all but one of them when they were between 2 and 3 weeks old. They are CURRENTLY 3-4 weeks old. How long do I need to keep all the doors and windows shut, change clothes and shower after going outside, and put booties on my dog every time he goes outside?How easily transferrable IS Marek's? I've read that it can travel on the wind for up to 3 miles, can be tracked in on shoes, clothes and hair, just by walking through your yard and I've read multipe time lengths that chicks should be kept isolated when there's Marek's disease. I've seen 3 weeks, 16 weeks and everywhere in between.It's getting pretty hot here and I'd really like to open a few windows, or turn on a fan without endangering my new baby chickens. Please tell me what's myth and what's reality! I would assume the strain I have isn't extremely virulent, as we've had no vaccine breaks in the entire time we've had the vaccinated birds, which I assume are carriers, since they lived with the last original flock member who died of Marek's for months, and have been exposed to every inch of soil on my property. Thank you!",

        "response":"Your chicks should be fine, and you should be able to ventilate. The virus that causes Marek's disease is thought to be ubiquitous in most areas. It replicates in feather follicles, and spreads in the dander, so it is very difficult to completely clean up all bits of dust and dander in a poultry house.The vaccine usually works well to prevent disease symptoms, though, so your chicks should be fine.Commercially, meat-type chicks will be placed in barns that may have virus present on the day they are hatched. Many are vaccinated about 3 days before they hatch (in ovo), but it's still a pretty short time.I would suggest you continue to have all of your chicks vaccinated in the future, and that should protect them. I don't think there is any evidence that you need to revaccinate them a second time.Your dog will probably appreciate not having to wear booties!",

        "response":"Thank you for your question about peppers.  Without a picture of your plants, I'm going to have to speculate that the 'brown spots' are indicative of blossom end rot.  This is caused by a deficiency of calcium, which peppers, tomatoes and eggplant, among others, need for fruit formation.  The problem is not a lack of calcium in the soil.  It is because the pH of the soil is too low (too acid).  By increasing the pH by adding lime (calcium carbonate), calcium can be absorbed.  Just adding calcium or watering more doesn't alter the pH.  I can find no source that indicates that adding iron and\/or zinc alters pH in the direction needed, but perhaps you lucked out!  I suggest you get an inexpensive soil pH testing kit.  Peppers need to be between 6.0 and 8.0 (water is 7.0).  Adding agricultural lime or dolomite increases soil pH; adding sulfur reduces it.  Hope this is helpful.",

Several changes occur until sexual maturity, eggs are laid and fertility can be achieved.As maturity advances beginning at about 3-4 months the following indicators can be used to determine gender. (I copied the following from the Web.)... Its bill soon loses  its dark grey coloring, and its sex can finally be distinguished  visually by three factors: 1)the bill is yellow in males, but black and orange in females; 2)the breast feathers are reddish-brown in males, but brown in females; and 3)in males, the center tail feather (drake feather) is curled, but in females, the center tail feather is straight.  During the final period of maturity leading up to adulthood (610  months of age), the plumage of female juveniles remains the same while  the plumage of male juveniles gradually changes to its characteristic colors...I hope this helps.",

        "response":"Thank you for your question about your little avocado plant. Drooping leaves are typically caused by a watering issue. (Avocados are accustomed to heat, but they can withstand it only if they get enough water.) I suggest you purchase an inexpensive probe (some have ladybugs on them) so you can see how wet the soil is. Only water when the soil is dry an inch down, and when you do water, soak it well and let it drain. \"A lot less often rather than a little all the time.\" I'm assuming your pot has a drain hole. Otherwise, the water will accumulate and drown your plant.You also might want to check the bottom of the pot (again, assuming it drains) to see if roots are coming out the hole. If so, the plant needs to be repotted into a larger container or, ideally, into the ground.  These can become enormous plants, and aren't really 'designed' to be in containers for very long.Here's a linkto a good resource for questions about your plant. Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Bird mites can survive several weeks to perhaps a couple of months without feeding on a host. You should point your exterminator to the location on your porch where the birds that died were nesting and ask that all nests on or near the house be treated. Birds have probably already left these nests by this time of the summer. While bird mites might bite humans if they have no access to their primary host (birds), they will not persist while continuing to feed on people. For future management, you may want to put bird spikes or other barriers to bird nesting on your home where birds were nesting this year.",

While very small, They are easily visible to the naked eye and an exterminator shouldbe able to collect them, identify them, and treat for them. If the exterminator cannot capture them or treatments fail, get a new exterminator. If they also fail, you might need to consider that you do not have bird mites.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. I think the missing 'link' is the definition of \"salt.\"  In soil science, \"Asalt, inchemistry, is defined as the product formed from the neutralisation reaction ofacidsandbases. Salts areionic compounds composed ofcations(positivelychargedions) andanions(negative ions) so that the product is electricallyneutral(without a net charge). These component ions can beinorganic such as chloride (Cl), as well asorganicsuch asacetate (CH3COO) andmonoatomic ions such as fluoride (F), as well aspolyatomic ions such as sulfate (SO42).There are several varieties of salts. Salts that produce hydroxideions when dissolved in water are basic saltsand salts that produce hydronium ions in water are acid salts. Neutral saltsare those that are neither acid nor basic salts. Zwitterions contain an anionic center and a cationic centre in the same moleculebut are not considered to be salts. Examples include amino acids, many metabolites, peptides and proteins. When salts are dissolved in water, they are called electrolytes, and are able to conduct electricity, a property that is shared with molten salts. Mixtures of many different ions in solutionlike in the cytoplasm of cells, in blood, urine, plant saps and mineral waters usually do not form defined salts after evaporation of the water. Therefore, their salt content is given for the respective ions.  Salts can appear to be clear and transparent (sodium chloride),opaque, and even metallic and lustrous (iron disulfide). In many cases the apparentopacity ortransparency are only related to the difference in size of the individualmonocrystals. Since light reflects from thegrain boundaries (boundaries between crystallites), largercrystalstend to be transparent, whilepolycrystalline aggregates look like white powders. Of course, some salts are inherentlyopaque. Salts exist in all differentcolors, e.g.yellow (sodiumchromate),orange (potassium dichromate),red (mercury sulfide),mauve (cobalt chloride hexahydrate),blue (copper sulfatepentahydrate,ferric hexacyanoferrate),green (nickel oxide), colorless (magnesium sulfate),white, andblack (manganese dioxide). Mostmineralsand inorganicpigmentsas well as many synthetic organicdyes are salts.\" So, \"salt\" doesn't just mean NaCl. It extends to the 16 macro and micro nutrients, as well as ions of the three 'building block' elements: oxygen, hydrogen and carbon.Here is a linkto a brief Extension article about 'curing' salt buildup.  And this one explains the differences between rainwater and tapwater. Or, if you want to eliminate these ions completely, use distilled water, which is 'pure' H20, since the mineral ions have not 'survived' evaporation.Hope this is helpful.",

        "response":"I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. My contact has not responded to my question. I consulted another reference book, Reptile Keeper's Handbook,by Susan M. Barnard, who is now deceased, but at the time was in charge of the reptile and amphibians at Zoo Atlanta.She recommended the following dimensions for enclosures: Length: 3\/4 the animal's length; Width: 1\/3 the animals' length; Height: 1\/2 the animal's length (maximum 8 feet). Due to the fact that Burmese pythons grow fairly rapidly until they reach about 10 feet, and to avoid having to repeatedly buy larger enclosures to keep up with your snake's growth, you may want to consider getting an enclosure based on a length of ten feet. Once the big pythons reach 5-6 feet, aquariums aren't really practical as enclosures. Constructing cages out of plywood aren't practical either, because they are difficult to sanitize. Fecal deposits and urates can soak into the wood, and it is difficult to clean adequately. With large snakes this usually means purchasing a custom enclosure from a company that specializes in reptile cages. These cages are generally expensive, but they are constructed out of materials that are strong and can be easily santized.For additional information about maintaining snakes see Ms. Barnard's book. It's probably not in your local library, but can probably be obtained through interlibrary loan. It is expensive if purchased new, but there are reasonably priced used copies available.Barnard, Susan M. (1996). Reptile Keeper's Handbook.

    "title-question":"proper planting of 12 gal photinia shrubs. I had a landscaper dig holes and plant twenty photinia x fraseri shrubs. They were in containers of approximately 12 gallon size. They are planted in a straight row along a very long fence line.  The other day, I had to move one of the plants to make room for some electrical outlet. I was quite surprised to find out that the plant had been placed in the hole and the space around the plant was loosely filled with a very light soil mix product. In fact, it is accurate to say that there is much space around the root ball and the walls of the hole, because the airy soil mix is not compacted and it is impossible to compact it in a way that would be appropriate.  Although it is a lot of work, my solution is to dig up and remove each plant from its hole (not as hard as I thought due to the loose nature of the soil mix product.) I then replant the photinia by slowly filling up the space between the root ball and the walls of the hole with native soil from the yard, making sure there are no air holes etc.  My landscaper says that is not necessary, but I am convinced it is completely necessary. If I put a length of 1\/2\" pvc pipe in the space between a photinia plant's root ball and the wall of the hole, I can push the pipe right to the bottom of the root ball as if there isn't even any dirt to impede the progress of the pipe.

Specifically, one side\/branch of the plant was getting too heavy, and needed staking. This sourcediscusses the importance of staking new plantings, as well as the branches that come from it, due to their weight. Your branch looks very heavy, and, if these plants are known to break as much as are these, I'd recommend taking that writer's advice and either supporting it from underneath, or secure it to the palm.Hope this is helpful.

      {
        "response":"Thanks for your question about growing cotton in Oregon. I have been unable to find much, if any, science-based information about growing this crop. This Extension article indicates that the needs of the most common genus, Gossypium hirsutum,are as follows:\"A long-season plant, cotton requires a minimum of 180200 frost-free days of uniformly high temperatures, averaging 2122C. [70 - 72 F] Full sunlight is critical for proper development. Where rainfall is less than 500 mm [20\"] annually, irrigation should be practiced. Amount of rainfall is not as important as when it falls. Heavy rains injure plants. Moderate rainfall is preferable during vegetative growth followed by a dry period to allow the bolls to mature and be picked. Cotton is tolerant of a wide variety of soils, but thrives best on deep, friable, moisture-holding soils with good humus supply. Optimum pH is 5.27.\"The Willamette Valley ecoregion ranges from 165 to 210 days of frost-free weather historically, with mean annual precipitation of 48\", ranging from 35 to 63\", the latter being in the foothills of the mountains.The only other thing I can share with you relevant to your question is a blog created by a person attempting to grow cotton (in the Portland metro area) about 9 years ago, that I found here, hereand here. Perhaps you can glean something about the potential success from these entries. Good luck!",

First, planting any plant in the summer is usually not a good idea, especially with the dry weather you have been having. Late fall is ideal. The reason is that young trees are naturally stressed by being removed from the soil, roots exposed to air, much (as try as hard as they attempt not to) of root ball and surrounding fungi removed, etc.And, birch trees are very susceptible to birch borers, an insect you might miss entirely unless you were familiar with them. Here's a linkto an Extension article about the tree, the borer issue, and how difficult it is to maintain these trees in your area.

        "response":"Thanks for your question about a choice of plants for your yard. Unfortunately, without knowing more about your soil, your rainfall and your climate, it's difficult to recommend plants. However, Master Gardeners in your county have compiled a great Extension article found herewith lots of good ideas about plants and a host of other gardening suggestions (through the links). Native plants are acclimated to the issues I first mentioned, and most need little to no supplemental watering once they're established (after the first year).If you have other questions, I suggest you contact the Extension office in your county, whose information is on this website.Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question about helping your soil over the winter! Whether winter rains deplete your soil of nutrients depends on the type of soil you have, and if you added topsoil and compost to your raised bed structures, there will be less 'leaching,' as this is called, than with native soil composed primarily of sand. That's because the compost added to the topsoil or native soil decomposes slowly, primarily through the work of microbes (bacteria, fungi, etc.). Adding plastic harms the microbes in two ways: it reduces the amount of moisture that reaches them (and they all need moist soil) and it depletes the oxygen getting to them, which they all need. Adding a layer of compost, as you suggested, will provide them additional 'food' over the winter. Worm castings--unless they have come from your worms--are rather expensive, and I'd recommend adding them in the spring when you are planting seeds and\/or transplants. Work them into the top few inches of your soil, near the roots. Adding them now won't serve any particular purpose. This UCarticlehas lots of information about soils and especially organic supplements.Some people do cover their garden beds with either cardboard or coffee bean sacks, which are made of burlap and allow both water and air to penetrate them. But, if you want to do something that will both protect your soil from getting compressed by the rain, as well as add nutrients to the soil: a cover crop. Here's a linkto a great UC Davis Extension article on the topic, and your timing for using this information is perfect!Hope these are helpful for you. Good luck!",

As they get older they will transition to a more diverse diet. Things you could consider planting would be native or non-weedy legumes. Wild game type birds key in on those throughout the year, but particularly in the winter. In the spring they will prefer small forbs and insects. Fruits are flowers will be abundant in the summer, and the seeds from those plants--at least those small enough for them to consume--are common forage for them in the late summer and fall.I know there are commercial blocks available specifically for quail, so you could try that at a small scale and get a feel for if they are preferring that over what is naturally available on your property. Best of luck! You might consider contacting your local fish and wildlife agency for other locally specific quail conservation tactics.",

      {
        "response":"My educated horticultural opinion is no your Fuji will not bloom in spring. The self pollinating flowers will develop fruit in the next 3 months. Apples require a cold dormancy. Southern California is not sufficiently cold for the dormancy requirements for a Fuji apple. The USDA lists Hardiness Zone 4-9 for Fuji apples. Your Marin County California is in Zone 10 which is too warm to force dormancy. Therefore your tree is out of syn with the weather. And it has no cold dormancy to reset its internal clock. In fact you are simulating growing apples in a greenhouse. Your tree does not know spring from fall because it has no cold indicators and it is likely using the day length as the trigger when to bloom. You are at the mercy of the local climate of Marin County. I would find a cultivar of apple that is compatible with your climate. Contact your county Extension Agent for advice on local apples. Note: with the shorter day length fruit development may take longer than usual.",

        "response":"Hello, Generally we do not recommend canning recipes that are not laboratory tested (research based), however I have looked at your recipe and the ingredients you are using are mostly acidic, having a pH or 4.5 or lower. Make sure that your vinegar is at least 5% acidity and your process time of 20 minutes for pint jars is fine. Check to make sure all jars seal and if not bring product back to a boil (5 minutes) and reprocess - do not reuse flat lid. Hope this helps and thank you for using eXtension.",

        "response":"Thanks for contacting us about your HACCP for seafood question. As you may have discovered, finding an official HACCP course on seafood is not as easy as it once was. However, this has actually been simplified a bit in recent years. There is online and in-person training available.   First, note that there are two segments to the training, and they must be taken in order. Online training only covers Segment One (Basic).   All of the in-person HACCP courses for seafood are now offered through the Association for Food and Drug Officials. Click on this link to open the (pdf file) list of training classes: http:\/\/www.afdo.org\/resources\/Documents\/5-training\/Listing%20of%20Registered%20Courses.pdf   The locations and trainers that offer training vary and you can attend wherever you would like, so you have some choices.    All of the online training is for Segment One only, through the National Seafood HACCP Alliance. Those who complete the internet course are eligible to attend a one-day Segment Two in-person course taught by an Alliance instructor. Click on this link to read about and register: http:\/\/seafoodhaccp.cornell.edu\/Intro\/index.html   There are manuals and much more detailed information about HACCP on this web page:  OSU Seafood Research &amp; Education Center Food Science &amp; Technology Department 2001 Marine Dr Ste 253 Astoria OR 97103-3420  USA   I cant recommend one instructor or location over another, but by taking training through the two above entities, you are assured your instructor is qualified to train.

Eye arrangement is a very criticalfeature used to classify spiders.Fortunately, you directed me a clue in the photo that will help us identify this spider to the family level. Notice the perfectly formed circular web behind this spider!  Highly characteristic of the orb spider family- Araneidae- just as you observed. As an entomologist who has learned how to recognize only the most abundant spider species in Washington State,I hesitate to go any further with this diagnosis based on the underside of the spider. However, I would not rule out a male (can't make our the pedipalps in this picture) cross-orb spider as a possibility.  You could try to resubmit an image so we can confirm or more accurately identify this orb spider.  Hope this helps!",

        "response":"Thank you for your question about your maple trees leaves.  This is a common occurrence in maples, and particularly Japanese maples.  It results from the plant not getting enough water.  Maples have shallow root systems, and when the top of the soil dries out, especially for weeks or months at a time, the tree gets stressed and the leaves die.  Maples dont have tap roots like many other trees, so they rely on humans to provide moisture.  You can also help the soil retain moisture by keeping mulch around the trees rootball.  Just be sure its not more than an inch thick (as it will keep your supplemental water out), and keep it away from the trunk.  Just leaving the leaves on the ground helps do thisas youd find in the forest.  Hope this is helpful.  Good luck!",

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question about pruning your older rose.  It does appear that this shrub is reaching for sunlight, and that's probably not helping you get as many blooms as you'd like.  The interesting thing about shaping of rose bushes is that lateral growth actually is preferred, as explained here:\"Training old roses is often more important than pruning them. Most will bloom better if the canes are more horizontal than vertical, such as when pegged down or trained along a fence. The bending stimulates the formation of lateral branches or flowering spurs all along the canes, and greatly increases the number of blooms per season. If bushes are left to grow vertically, blossoms will be located only on the tips of the canes. The lateral shoots may be pruned back 1\/3 each year.\"Rather than repeating what is in the article, I think I'll just highlight that any pruning needs to be done after the blooms are spent, and that pruning the ends of the original cane should be done above a node, where you see foliage coming out (I can see in the middle picture.) I wish we knew the species, since this resource has such good species-specific advice. Perhaps once your plant flowers next year, you can snap some photos and either send them here, or take them to a garden center or even your local Extension office, for identification.I hope this information is helpful. Good luck!",

      {
        "response":"Hello. At high altitudes, there is lower atmospheric pressure, or air pressure, which changes the temperature at which water boils and how quickly leavening gases expand. Because water boils at lower temperatures, moisture evaporates quicker and can leave baked goods dry. Since you are baking at a lower altitude and transporting to a higher altitude, packaging may play a part and the lower air pressure is pulling the moisture out of your product. I would recommend trying to find air tight packaging for transporting the product. The same would apply to transport of any baked good. Hope this helps and thanks for using eXtension.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Dear Client, I am unable to confirm your spider's identity from the photo, but your observations about webbing, the general form of the spider and the egg mass are certainly consistent with grass spiders in the spider family Agelenidae.   I suspect that your female spider was looking for a sheltered area to lay her egg mass so that the offspring will better survive temperature fluctuations during the winter months. One issue that you may encounter is that the eggs may hatch prematurely before their typically prey become abundant enough to support the crew of spiderlings.   As for what the food source for these spiderlings would be, we can only guess based on what we know for the native habitat of the species (or in this case family).  Spiders in this family are web-weavers, but the web is not sticky.  So whatever they feed on has to 'trip' the webbing, so the spider will rush out and tackle the prey or at least bite the prey if it is several sizes too big.  The fangs will inject a quick acting toxin.  If the spider's habitat is in a grassy groundcover, I would suspect anything small that flies or jumps (gnats, springtails); if the spider's habitat shrubs or bushs, we might be looking at a number of small flies (gnats, whiteflies, aphids, etc.). There is one thing that I suspect might constitute food for your spiderlings if nothing is available-- other spiders, including their brothers and sisters.   In the end, my suggestion is to place the egg mass somewhere outdoors and let Mother Nature (ambient outdoor temperatures) control the hatching of the eggs. This way the spiderlings will have a better opportunity to disperse before they turn on each other as a food source.

As you can read, light, water, humidity and fertilization are all components of ficus' health.  I'm not sure what your habits are in watering and fertilizing, but the humidity is typically low in SoCal, and that will be difficult to alter if the plants are outside.What concerns me about the plant on the right, however, is that it might have an insect infestation.  The last paragraph in the above article lists scale and aphids as causes of the curling.  Unfortunately, the photo is too far away for me to detect any, so you'll have to search.  Since scale are typically on the stems, and there don't appear to be any 'bumps,' I'm suspecting aphids.  I've attached photos of both, so you'll know what you're looking for.If you want, you could cut off some of these leaves and take them to your Extension office (9335 Hazard Way, Suite 201, San Diego) or call them ((858) 822-7711).Hope this is helpful.

One of the first characters I look for are the arrangement of the eyes, but I can't see them as I suspect that I am looking at the underside of the spider.  The overall size of the spider is important as well, but I can only assume that this was a large-sized spider to have fangs large enough to puncture human skin (our best defense against spiders).  As I look at the leg arrangement, leg banding, relative size of the legs to each other and mouthparts, I am suspecting that your female spider is a species in the orb weaver spider family -Araneidae.  One of the most common spiders in this family in California is the cross orb spider and the underside of this spider does suggest this, but another good character is the top side of the abdomen, which I cannot see in your images.

        "response":"Thank you for your question.  At first glance, it seems logical that snakes could be a viable solution to a rodent problem.  However, snakes are probably not going to be an effective solution for a couple of reasons. First, you'll have to catch the snakes.  The Gopher Snake (Pituophis catenifer) would be a good choice, but they can be difficult to locate.  Second, assuming you can catch some, you have to convince them to stay around the burrows. Once you release them, you don't have any control over where they go. They may stay in the area or move to another location. In addition, over time, pocket gophers have evolved to develop techniques for keeping snakes out of their burrows. They plug the entrances with soil, and actually pack soil into their burrow some distance from the entrance to discourage unwanted visitors. The most successful gopher predators, reportedly, are raptors (hawks and owls) and coyotes.A good reference for pocket gophers, including their distribution, ecology and management is a chapter on pocket gophers, written by Robert J. Baker, Robert D. Bradley and Lee R. McAliley Jr., in the book Wild Mammals of North America - Biology, Management and Conservation.Feldhamer, George A., Thompson, Bruce C. and Chapman, Joseph A.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"The body of spiders (and other invertebrates) cools with the surrounding air temperatures. It may be possible that depending upon the body size, the spider body serves as a heat sink retaining heat and cooling more slowly than the surrounding temperature; perhaps this would explain the also slower warming in the morning that you have noted.Some insects can actually warm their bodies through increased muscle activity (activation of flight muscles for example), and a few insects can increase surrounding temperature as they mass in large numbers (bees, termites). But neither of these mechanisms are likely to occur for spiders which are predatory and flightless.As a test, see if the anomaly remains now that the spider and webbing have been removed.",

        "response":"Thanks Dr. Gerry!It's good to know that spiders don't normally produce heat. The anomalous readings have stopped since I cleaned the chamber and evicted the spider but they were always intermittent so that's not at all conclusive. It might be a winged insect that gets trapped in the spider web that creates the heat.... I attached the temperature graphs for two days in October that illustrates the anomaly.

The housing system must be able to keep predators out, both wild animals and domestic dogs, the birds prefer to sleep on roosts that are off the ground by at least a couple of feet or more, depending on the types of chickens, and a couple of nests that provide a safe and comfortable place for the hens to lay eggs.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question.  The snake in your photo is a garter snake.  There are several species of garter snakes in California, including three whose distribution includes all or part of Siskiyou County.  A positive identification of some garter snake species requires that you have the snake in-hand, so that you can count scale rows, determine the number and placement of certain types of scales on the head, examine the underside of the snake, etc.  I believe your snake is Thamnophis atratus hydrophilus, one of the subspecies of the Pacific Coast Aquatic Garter Snake.  This species is also called the Oregon Garter Snake. Garter snakes are considered non-venomous, but their saliva does contain some toxic properties which help the snake subdue its prey, which include tadpoles, small frogs and toads, fish and aquatic salamanders.  Some people who have been bitten report mild swelling and itching at the site of the bite. Length varies from 18 - 40 inches, with average size between 18 - 28 inches. According the book, The Garter Snakes - Evolution and Ecology, by Douglas A. Rossman, Neil B. Ford and Richard A. Seigel, this species is most often found in and around shallow rocky creeks and swift flowing streams.  They can also be found in ponds with muddy bottoms.  They do appear to prefer open basking areas and utilize rocky outcrops to bask.  When threatened these snakes will generally try to escape to the water. If they feel cornered, they will also flatten their head and inflate their body to make themselves appear larger, as the snake in your photo is demonstrating.  If you try to pick them up, they will usually discharge a strong-smelling musk from their anal glands and will strike and bite repeatedly. In addition to the book referenced above, check this webpage of California Herps - A Guide to the Amphibians and Reptiles of California for additional photos and information about this species: http:\/\/www.californiaherps.com\/snakes\/pages\/t.a.hydrophilus.html Ihopethisinformationhelps, andthankyouforcontactingAskanExpert.

Assuming that the spider was captured in California or at least the USA before it was preserved than it may be the banded argiope, Argiope trifasciata, rather than the Black-and-Yellow Argiope. I have uploaded an image that I have of the banded argiope for you to compare.   I see that you may be a stamp collector as well. I recognize the 1961 Queen Elizabeth II with Prince Andrew.

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question about desert roses and baby tears. When looking for compatible plants, you want to know 4 things: how much water, how much light, what temperature and how much space. So, let's compare these two plants:Desert rose: low water (but will drop leaves if too little); sun-loving; warm temperatures since it's tropical; fills in its container with its thick, swollen trunk, that holds water since it is a succulent. (I've attached a photo of a desert rose used as a bonsai plant; you can see how enormous this can get!)Baby tears: constantly moist soil and high humidity; shade or part shade; warm temperatures; spreads quickly over most moist surfaces.So, their needs differ in the water and light areas; are the same in the temperature test; and both can take up a lot of room in a container. Although a succulent such as a desert rose (which technically is not a rose at all) could normally be paired with another succulent, I think you're going to find that there won't be enough room in the container before long, and that the smaller succulent will not thrive. Perhaps if you just add a ground cover such as that seen in the photo, that will be adequate. Just don't use something like peat moss that holds water, or you'll run the risk your rose will get root rot. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

      {
        "response":"Dear Client, I have heard about these female black widow look-alikes, but this is the first time I have seen one.  Your spider is actually known as the female brown widow, Latrodectus geometricus. It is common to California and the Southernmost US States. According to BugGuide, \"The brown widow is highly variable in color. It may be almost white to almost black.\"  The darker the spider's color, the more difficult it is to distinguish this spider from the black widow.  The banded legs is another feature that helps us distinguish between the brown and the closely related black widow female spider.  Incidentally, the egg masses are also typical of the spiders in this Latrodectus genus. \"Be very careful when working around areas where widow spiders may be established. Take proper precautions-wear gloves and pay attention to where you are working. The reaction to a widow bite can be painful, and the victim should go to the doctor immediately for treatment.\"  -BugGuide \"However, brown widow bites are usually not very dangerous; usually much less dangerous than those of L. mactans, the black widow.\" Wikipedia- Los Angeles Times. Retrieved 28 September 2012. https:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/23403 https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Latrodectus_geometricus Hope this helps.",

        "response":"I apologize.  You did, indeed, say \"Holiday,\" but, as I've never heard of this variety, it just slipped by me!  I found this Extension information on avocados in general, which applies as well to \"Holiday\" avocados:\"How to tell when an avocado is ripe  The avocado is an amazing fruit. It grows on a tree and comes to maturity, reaches certain oil content and a stage at which it will ripen, but does not ripen on the tree. It needs to be removed from the tree before it will soften. If the fruit is removed before it has reached maturity it will not soften, and will remain rubbery and inedible. One of the problems is that the fruit will hang on the tree for an extended period of time and it is hard to know when they are mature. Avocados are not like apricots where you have about 2 weeks to get the fruit off before it falls off. As the fruit stays on the tree in gradually develops more and more oil content and has a richer flavor.  If the fruit stays on the tree too long, the oil can develop and almost rancid flavor, however. So it is good to know when the best, acceptable flavor is. Avocado varieties fall into general seasonal periods when they are mature Fuerte in winter, Hass in spring\/summer, Lamb-Hass in summer\/fall. Or you can pick a fruit and put it on the counter and watch to see if it softens evenly. If it does in a two week period, the rest on the tree are good to go.\" This variety falls into the latter group:  \"Holiday   Guatemalan type bears excellent flavor, pear shaped, 18-24 oz green fruit which hold the tree very well. It is a smaller tree than Wurtz. It was named Holiday because the fruit ripens between Labor Day and New Year's Day.\" I hope this information gives you some guidance.",

        "response":"Dear Client, First, let me assure you that this spider is absolutely NOT a brown recluse spider.   It is difficult to make out the diagnostic features to help confirm the true identity of this spider like the eye arrangement (all 8 of them), and the number of claws at the end of each leg.  However, this spider is commonly known as a ground spider in the family Gnaphosidae.  I base this on the overall flattened shape of the abdomen and relative length of the (short and hairy) legs. One of the key characters that I can make out is the very distinct pair of spinnerets (tailpipes) at the end of the abdomen.   In general spiders are considered beneficial arthropods that prey on insects and other invertebrate pests.  Spider members of this family are known as nocturnal hunters that stalk and run down insects that are found on the ground or other surfaces.  They do not spin webs to capture their prey.  They do have fangs to capture and subdue their prey, but often they are too small to puncture human or pet skin.  They will try in self-defense and some might be able to puncture skin, but their venom is not toxic to humans or mammals.   https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Ground_spider https:\/\/bugguide.net\/node\/view\/1970 This should erase you fears about this spider.

        "response":"It is difficult to tell from the photo, but this is a grafted tree like most fruit trees. From the angle of the photo I would say you are seeing blooming from the root-stock which has been allowed to grow above ground. As for the rest of the tree not blooming that could be from several causes and may change from year to year. It is possible it buds and then you have cold temperatures which may kill the flowers or the tree may receive too much nitrogen fertilizer being in a lawn area. It does look as through the tree has put on several feet of new growth in the past year. Depending on your pruning time you may also be pruning out you flowering wood. These links should help you with proper pruning of the tree and I would suggest removing the suckers coming from the root-stock. http:\/\/homeorchard.ucanr.edu\/The_Big_Picture\/Pruning_&amp;_Training\/ http:\/\/homeorchard.ucdavis.edu\/pruningfruit.pdf",

What's not to like? Just be sure the raised structure drains well and has good air circulation. Check the plants for insects, fungi (white or grey fluffy matter growing on top of the soil), and that the foliage gets and stays green.

(A scientific article not from Extension is found here, if you'd like to wade through it.) Another way to estimate the age of the trees is to know (1) when your townhouses were built, (2) what was present on the property before construction began, and (3) whether the trees were there before. The prior owner, or a survey or photos of the property, might give you some clues about their age. If grown in the 'right' conditions, these trees need little care, and have been known to live as long as 200 years. (Not the 2000 years of the redwood, but impressive!)Hope this is helpful.",

        "response":"Thank you for your question about your fig tree. If it is a caprifig, it won't produce figs in Venice. The reasons are several: First, the pollinating insect is not available where you live and second, caprifigs thrive in Western Asia, a far different climate.This article describes how to grow imported caprifigs in the San Joaquin Valley.  \"Fig in California\" (http:\/\/fruitandnuteducation.ucdavis.edu\/fruitnutproduction\/Fig\/) You might consider replacing the existing tree, and obtaining a fruiting kind. Fortunately, a number of fig trees, after they are established, can be managed at a reasonable size with annual hard pruning. Then, too, several kinds grow to just 8-feet tall.That said, this spring, you can easily obtain a young fruiting fig at a nearby large  scale garden center. With a modicum of care, including summer water, the new tree will rapidly develop a good size. Ask the staff which fig will do well where you  live. Good luck with your fig. I know I enjoyed the fresh fruit from my tree when I lived in Long Beach. Ir was always superior to store-bought.",

        "response":"The wasps that pollinate caprifigs (Blastophaga psenes) are very small, in fact, they're speck-sized. (Lets back up a moment to correct that information: Caprifigs are used to cross pollinate Smyrna figs, which are the imported dried kinds.)  These fig-pollinating wasps are far different than the common wasps seen in home gardens, among them yellow jackets, baldfaced hornets, and various paper wasps, all of which dine on fruit left on the tree too long. With figs, over-ripe fruit typically ferments if left on the tree, a choice meal for insects. Or, possibly that the fruit needs to be harvested every several days.  Because you see lots of wasps in the tree, I wonder if the problem is lack of water through the summer and other dry months. If so, that shortage would be the reason for dry, seedy figs. (Even so, mine was producing well without summer irrigation right up until I left Long Beach 19 years ago.)  If you want to experiment, you could try watering the tree every 3 to 4 weeks through the summer and other dry months. To help the soil retain the applied water, add a mulch of bark chips under the tree, 3- to 4-inches deep, all the way to the drip line. Water the outer half of the area to the dripline, each time to 6 or 8 inches deep.",

It's not uncommon for lower branches to get shaded out and die. But this tree appears to be dying from the tip\/leader down and so it seems unlikely it will be able to recover even if trimmed.

The damage results in fist-sized holes one after another in a line below my gutters which are directly attached to 7-inch wood molding and the fascia board . This time I am hoping I will put an end to any future damage by replacing my gutters entirely. I am having the fascia board completely covered in metal flashing and have purchased a much larger gutter to cover the area that was once wood molding. In other words, when a woodpecker stands on my gutters they should only have contact with metal and no wood. Now, I heard that woodpeckers are creatures of habit. My question is, will they continue to try to peck on my new metal gutters once they are installed? If so, what can I do to effectively deter them so that they don't make dents in my new gutters?

If your flies fit this category, then one thing you may be able to do is make the air in that location less calm using fans or blowers. If the area is of limited size (like a porch) you may be able to use some repellents to drive the flies away (try citronella candles or torches, or odor dispensers like those in a bathroom that pulse out pyrethrins or other botanical odors).Some flies over over objects in the environment that they use as a marker to form their swarm. Swarm markers could be a bush or other object with some height above ground or even a patch of ground with contrasting color relative to the surrounding environment. If this is the case, then eliminate the swarm marker to move the flies to another less bothersome location.Hope that these suggestions are helpful.",

        "response":"Thank you for your question about your cherry tree. Cherry trees are a member of the Prunus family, whose members have a host of problems in the home garden. Here is a link to an Extension article that lists just a few of them, but they all have leaf curling and browning symptoms. The issue you raise that gives me pause is the \"this is the third cherry tree that has died in this spot\" one, because it may mean that you have a problem such as Verticillium wilt, a soil borne fungus that kills many plants, although typically over a longer period of time. Planting the same susceptible plants there time after time is just a recipe for disaster. (\"If you always do what you've always done, you'll always get what you've always gotten!\")There are not too many articles that address the issue in California; however, this study would seem to suggest that it might be present in nurseries supplying cherries to commercial outlets. But I cannot jump to that conclusion with the scant information I have.So, I suggest you take some of the brown stems, together with your photographs, to your county Extension office, whose contact information can be found here. Note that Master Gardeners are available only on Thursdays from 9:30 to 11:30 am.I am sorry for the loss of your trees, and hope that your Extension Service can provide you with an analysis and treatment ideas.

These insects cannot persist in your home and will usually soon die on their own leaving you in peace. Fogging or other treatments are really only needed for insects that can live and reproduce in your home - blood feeding insects and some insects that feed on wood (e.g. termites) or natural fibers (some moths and beetles).

      {
        "response":"Hi Shanelle!  Thank you for your question.  Convincing a parent who's afraid of snakes to let you keep one can be a tough sell.  I would definitely start with aa captive raised species like a corn snake, ratsnake or kingsnake, rather than a boa. Boas require a little more experience to take care of properly, require larger prey and larger enclosure, and can grow to be about 12 feet long, which I suspect would not make your Mom's day.Here's an idea that might help your Mom learn more about snakes and see that keeping one in your house is not all that unusual. There is a herpetological society in Sacramento that has monthly meetings. Here's a link to their website:http:\/\/www.norcalherp.com\/Youmighttryseeing ifshewouldtakeyouto oneofthesociety's monthlymeetings,soshecouldmeetadultsthatkeepsnakesand possiblyparentswholettheirchildrenhavesnakes aspets.Ifshetalkstosomeotheradultswhohavebeenkeepingsnakesfora longtime,itmighthelpherfeelmorecomfortableaboutlettingyourkeeponeyourself.The size of your tank depend will depend on the size of your snake. If, for example, you get a corn snake that's large enough to eat fuzzy mice, you can keep it in a 10-gallon aquarium with a secure screen top. The top can be secured with clamps that you can purchase at any store that sells aquariums and tops for reptiles. A larger adult corn, ratsnake or kingsnake can require a 20- or 30-gallon tank depending on their size. If you need a heat lamp, you can usually purchase this at the same store that sells aquariums. I recommend purchasing a stand that slides under the aquarium from which you can hang the heat lamp. The stand safely secures the lamp rather than just setting the lamp on the screen top. Also, since the stand is adjustable, you can raise or lower it to adjust temperature in the aquarium. Here's a link to show you what they look like:https:\/\/www.petco.com\/shop\/en\/petcostore\/product\/zoo-med-reptile-lamp-standYou can, of course, purchase much nicer enclosures for your snake, but they can be pretty expensive. If you Google \"snake enclosures\", you take a look at everything from aquariums to custom cages.Ihopethis informationhelpsandgoodluck!!Jim",

However, research indicates that eggplant pollination and fruit-set is enhanced by bee activity. Encourage wild bees and other pollinating insects in your garden by planting pollinatorattracting flowers nearby. Minimize the use of pesticides in your garden and follow label precautions when they are used. With or without insect pollination, blossom drop will occur without flowers setting fruit when temperatures are above 95F or below 60F.\"Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

        "response":"Thank you for your question. There are several subspecies of gophersnake in California. Based on your Alameda County's location, this should be the Pacific gophersnake, scientific name (Pituophis catenifer catenifer).  Gophersnakes are non-venomous. Average size of this species is 4.5 - 5 feet long, and maximum lengths of up to 9 feet have been recorded.This snake feeds primarily on small mammals, such as pocket gophers, moles, rabbits and mice. They will also feed on birds and bird eggs. They are powerful constrictors.They are found in a variety of habitats, including open grasslands, mixed forests, coniferous forests, agricultural fields, marshlands and suburban homes.If threatened they will usually try to escape, or them may freeze in place and depend on their markings to make themselves difficult to spot. If the threat comes closer they may elevate their body and flatten their head and hiss loudly to intimidate whatever is threatening them.For additional information and more photos of this species and typical habitats see the California Herps webpage at:http:\/\/www.californiaherps.com\/snakes\/pages\/p.c.catenifer.html#originaldescriptionHope this answers your question, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

Maintenance: Early pruning needed to train to desired shape; pruning needed less frequently with age. Removal of root suckers. Sidewalk clean-up during seed capsule drop.    Tolerance: Drought (once established), any soil, fog.    Special Considerations: Prefers sun and space. Needs good drainage. Does not tolerate strong or gusty winds.

Then, youll need to adjust the pH by using sulfur.  You can also try to apply a foliar chelated iron application.  Is there a possibility of transplanting the shrub into clay soil which has been amended with compost?  This is typically an acidic medium in the pH range hydrangeas need.  Hope this is helpful.

Some of the important features used to identify spiders are the body size, orientation of the six-eight eyes, appendages at theback end of the spider. orientation of the mouthparts relative to the body. A lot of this is a problem with the lack of contrast between features of the spider. I would guess that this is one of the megalomorph spiders because of the body form; but it is not a tarantula (they have hairy legs!). It may be one of the trapdoor spiders that abound in California.It is likely to be coming from under the house or at the foundation of the house. All spiders have fangs and will bite in self-defense. Don't handle the big spiders. While your spider is not poisonous to humans (very few spiders in the USA are \"poisonous\" to humans), it will be painful ifthe fangs break the skin's surface. Always treat these \"puncture\" wounds with care and make sure the bite site does not become infected or inflamed. When this happens, always call and see your primary health careprovider.

One of the more common fungal pathogens is verticillium wilt, which affects some deciduous trees and vegetables. Without your having had a soil test done to determine the cause of the tree's demise, I can't tell you whether there is anything in the soil that will doom your vegetables. It is what is in the soil, not the roots, that would be toxic (unless it were a walnut tree, which has its own toxin in its plant cells.)You can try to plant some vegetables in the tree's place to see if they live and thrive. Nothing in the soil should cause any problems for your health. Sorry I can't help more with the information you have. Good luck!",

    "title":"Drip irrigation line hole spits out water several feet.",
    "title-question":"Drip irrigation line hole spits out water several feet. I have a red drip line irrigation system. I was recently doing yard work and accidentally cut into the drip line without realizing it. I cut out the bad part and repaired it with a coupler. Which is working great. However the hole next to the coupler now spits out water whenever the water is turned on. The water literally spits upwards several feet. I want to say three. The hole looks just like all the others in the line. Yet the other holes do not sprout out water like this one does. It did not do this before the repair. I'm confused on how to fix it. I'm concerned that if I plug it up in some way that the hole next down the line will have the same issue. How do I fix this problem?",

If that is the case, you should be able to cut just beyond the hole and recoup let and stop the problem. Unless there is something different about the dripayment tubing you have, each hole has a channel an inch or so long leading to each hole.",

There are several forms: one has black or brown bands alternating with white or pale yellow bands; another form is a striped form, like yours, that has a white or pale yellow stripe down its back. There is a lot of variability in the patterns, and in the striped form, the stripe can be broken up, as in your snake. The striped form generally occurs in coastal southern California.

        "response":"Thank you for contacting Ask an Expert in regards to your basil plant. It sounds to me as if your basil has root rot due to overwatering and possibly to high of nutrients in its soil  we tend to over-love our plants!   Basil does its best in well-drained, moist soil with a neutral pH. I recommend adding a rich compost to the soil at the beginning of the season. No more soil amendment is necessary. In fact, if the soil is too rich, basil loses some of its flavor intensity.   Give basil water when the soil is dry to the touch, doing your best to water the plant at its base and not all over its leaves. Basil does not like wet soil nor roots. So at this time if your basil is still in poor condition I recommend getting a new plant and starting over with the recommendations above.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert. Your plants look pretty good.  Since raspberries are self-pollinating, you do not need another plant. With another variety for cross pollination, you may find better fruit set. However even with the self pollination, they should have adequate insect pollinators.  Consider that each small drop of fluid on a berry needs to be pollinated in order to develop. Even if you do have insect pollinators there are reasons that they may not visit the flowers.The temperature could be below 55 degrees which keeps bees from flying. Or the temperature could be too high above 85 degrees and the pollen grain does not germinate. Winds could keep the bees from flying too.Did it rain during blossom time? Do you have other plants that flowered at the same time? Raspberries do produce nectar but bees could be more attracted to other flowers. And, insecticidal sprays will kill the pollinators - does not have to be on the plants.Generally speaking the majority of pollination comes from pollinators. There are many pollinators from honey bees and bumble bees to hover flies and beetles. These insects play important roles in pollination.Did any of the things I mentioned happen during blossom time?",

      },
      {
        "response":"Thanks for sending the additional information.  Indian summer is listed as an ever-bearing raspberry meaning it has two bloom times spring and fall.  However, most of the info that I found on this variety states it is Fall bearing.  I am guessing that the plant is new and it may take a year for it to start bearing fruit.  That said, you could add some phosphorus now (that's the middle number on a fertilizer bag) to improve your blooms for a possible fall batch of berries.  The three numbers on the bag are always in the same order, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium.  Make sure the first number is low. You don't want more green leaves that the nitrogen will produce.  You want blooms that the phosphorus will help create.  Potassium helps with the metabolism of the plant.  Look for organic fertilizer that has OMRI on the front of the package.  That's a sign that it has been tested and found to adhere to the organic rules. Always follow the directions on the package. Great, no pesticides.  If you have any disease or pest issues, please write back and we can assist you with written information on bio-controls or organic fungicides. You may need some patience with this plant. Hopefully it blooms and sets fruit this fall.  For next spring leave the strongest canes and fertilize early in the spring.  Your plant should set blooms for a spring harvest.  Remove damaged or dead canes. When looking for info on the web try:  Indian summer raspberry site:.edu.  That will give you information from universities instead of random garden information.  The site:.edu should be typed exactly as shown.  Good luck hope the raspberry harvest is tasty this fall.",

Plums not flowering is often caused by no pruning.  Have you done that?  Do you give your tree supplemental watering?  Have you checked the leaves and trunk forvinsects?  I cannot tell from your photos whether there might be either.  UCAL has a great article on the many problems that beset plum trees, that you can read here:  http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/selectnewpest.plum.html  Since the list is so large, I suggest you contact your county Extension office and decide how to proceed.

In NM, it has been verified once in Roswell but is otherwise scattered in the extreme eastern edges of NM. From there, BRS might be found to the east to the Atlantic and perhaps as far north as KY. This hasn't changed over the years since this map was drawn.There are hundreds of species of spiders that are brown or tan or combinations of the these two colors.Distinguishing features for BRS---1) cephalothorax has a violin marking2) spider has 6 eyes arranged in pairs3) 8 spindly legs are covered in very fine, short 'hairs'The initial little blister on your skin comes from the injection of venom plus local reaction to it. That happens when you get a shot of just about anything close to the skin. That's why the nurse or doctor pinches your skin just after removing the needle---to keep the injected fluid inside or else it will leak out.Alas, antibiotics are handed out for just about anything as a precaution by doctors and practioners---whether you need it or not.Your wound should be healed by now.....and without further complications unless it's itching.

If you see these insects with wings or flying as you suggest, then I am wrong and they are not collembola. Perhaps you have several kinds of insects.

From your description, it would appear to be on its own roots, as this publication (https:\/\/www.hort.purdue.edu\/newcrop\/morton\/kumquat.html) says: \"Kumquats are rarely grown from seed as they do not do well on their own roots.  In China and Japan they are grafted onto the trifoliate orange (Poncirus trifoliata).  This has been found the best rootstock for kumquats in northern Florida and California and for dwarfing for pot culture.\"I'm also wondering what fertilizer you are giving them.  They \"are especially susceptible to zinc deficiency, which can cause small leaves and reduced internode distance.\" Perhaps you can test the soil of your plant, and determine whether it is deficient in either the N-P-K nutrients, or zinc. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question,Managing yellow jackets is not an easy task but it can be done. The best information I found about it is pasted below. The original article comes from Clemson University. I think is very good. If you check the original article, it also explains how to construct a home-made trap.https:\/\/www.clemson.edu\/extension\/beekeepers\/fact-sheets-publications\/yellow-jackets.htmlControl at PicnicsFrequent removal of garbage around picnic sites will reduce problems with yellow jackets. All food and beverage containers should be covered until served. Open soda containers should be checked carefully prior to consumption. Live yellow jackets have been swallowed by persons resulting in a life threatening sting in the throat area. Garbage can lids should fit tightly to reduce foraging. Garbage cans and dumpsters can be sprayed with an insecticide labeled for that use. Control of Underground NestsVisit your local hardware store or garden center and purchase a product labeled for yellow jacket control. Follow all label directions. Insecticides should be applied late evening or at night when all foragers are inside the nest. The nest entrance should be identified and marked during daytime. A quick knockdown insecticide is preferred because yellow jackets may fly out to defend the colony when disturbed. Yellow jackets are attracted to light, so do not hold a flashlight while applying an insecticide to a nest. Direct the insecticide dispenser nozzle toward the nest entrance for best control. Check the colony entrance the next day for activity and reapply again if necessary. If daytime control is necessary, the person should wear protective gear including a hat, veil, coveralls, and gloves because returning foragers will likely attempt to defend the colony. Control of Above Ground NestsRemember, yellow jacket colonies do not normally survive the winter and the first hard freeze will eliminate most colonies. If the colony is located in an out of the way place where human or pet contact is not possible, you may allow cold weather to freeze the colony. If this is not possible, you should visit the local hardware store or garden center and purchase a container of pressurized insecticide labeled for yellow jacket or hornet control. The product should allow a straight stream of knockdown insecticide to be emitted from a nozzle. If yellow jacket control is necessary during daylight hours, begin spraying the insecticide in a fanning motion as you approach the nest to repel colony defenders and returning foragers. For complete nest elimination, spray the stream of insecticide directly into the nest entrance which will normally be located at the bottom of the nest. Check the nest for activity the next day and reapply if necessary. Protective clothing is highly recommended. Control in BuildingsElimination of yellow jacket nests in buildings can be difficult. Use an insecticide that is labeled for yellow jacket control in buildings. Since yellow jackets are attracted to light, they may find another exit and may enter the inside of the building, especially if control is done at night. If this happens, you must close off any alternate exits. Trapping Yellow JacketsThere are several inexpensive non-toxic bait traps available for yellow jacket control including the Wasp Trap, the Oak Stump Farm Yellow Jacket Wasp Trap and the Yellow Jacket Inn. These are available at garden centers and mail order catalogs. Traps should be placed around the perimeter recreational areas well in advance of outdoor activities. Traps may be placed along side dumpsters or restaurant loading docks. Most trap directions call for a reservoir to be filled with an attractant such as sugar water. Exhausted yellow jackets fall into the liquid and drown. Traps should be serviced daily to remove dead insects because the odor can become very offensive. Wash the trap with soap and water after several days use. Monitor the traps attractiveness to beneficial insects such as honey bees and alter the bait if necessary. Raw bologna has proven to be a very successful yellow jacket bait and it does not attract beneficial insects.   Another good publication I found is from Washington State University:  https:\/\/s3.wp.wsu.edu\/uploads\/sites\/1384\/2016\/07\/Yellowjackets-and-Paper-Wasps.pdf    Ihope thishelps,",

If they are inside your home, it means your home is not properly sealed. Check to make sure your exterior doors have sweeps or brushes that eliminate gaps underneath, and make sure your windows are sealed (around frame) and properly screened.How do you know that your son is being 'bitten'? Many spider bites hurt, so waking up with unexplaineddermatitis('bites') is never cause to suspect spiders. In large part, 'spider bites' are an urban myth; spiders just don't go around biting people. The only way you're likely to get bitten by a spider is if you are handling one or if one is stuck in your clothing. Most 'bites' are actually bacterial infections from small wounds.

    "title-question":"Becoming an official caregiver for my mother. My 83-year-old mother now lives with my husband and I. A couple of years ago I quit my job of 15 years to care for her. She was recovering from her second total knee replacement surgery on the same knee and had complications. It has now become difficult for us to make ends meet on my husband's government job income alone. I need to go back to work to finance some of the costs of taking care of my mother. She only receives a few hundred dollars a month from social security benefits. On a given week she has anywhere from 3 to 7 health-related appointments and often has an appointment every day of the week. Someone informed me that she may qualify to have me become her caregiver officially and I may get financial assistance to do so. If we can make that happen I may be able to continue caring for her.

    "question":"My 83-year-old mother now lives with my husband and I. A couple of years ago I quit my job of 15 years to care for her. She was recovering from her second total knee replacement surgery on the same knee and had complications. It has now become difficult for us to make ends meet on my husband's government job income alone. I need to go back to work to finance some of the costs of taking care of my mother. She only receives a few hundred dollars a month from social security benefits. On a given week she has anywhere from 3 to 7 health-related appointments and often has an appointment every day of the week. Someone informed me that she may qualify to have me become her caregiver officially and I may get financial assistance to do so. If we can make that happen I may be able to continue caring for her.

        "response":"The opportunities to find out information about becoming a paid caregiver for your own parent (or parents) depends on where you live and what services your community provides for caregivers. In most states and cities, there are only a few programs in which family members can earn money for caregiving but if you make some calls you can find knowledgeable people at your local department of aging, your local senior center, your local Area Agency on Aging, or your area health clinics or primary care doctor. One thing that might help you navigate through those places, is that you could ask the agency if they know of any programs of \"Consumer-directed care.\" \"Consumer-directed care\" is a technical term but the people who are professionals in senior services will know what choices you may have in your town.",

I apologize for the delay in responding to your question, but the quality of the photographs is such that I can't make out all of the characteristics I need to make a positive identification, and I had to do some additional research. California has over 80 species of snakes,andwhile, based on your photograph, Icouldeliminatemostofthem,severalspeciesaresimilarinappearance.Yoursnakeis not a venomous species. I believe it is a red racer or red coachwhip (common names for the same species), scientific name Coluber flagellum piceus, formerly named Masticophis flagellum piceus. Length of this species is normally 33 - 66 inches. Here's a link to the California Herps website, where you can see additional photographs of this species to see if it resembles the snake you saw: http:\/\/www.californiaherps.com\/snakes\/pages\/c.f.piceus.htmlIn California, this species occurs from portions of Mona County south to San Diego and Imperial Counties and west to Santa Barbara County. This species frequents open areas, including desert, grasslands, scrub and sagebrush. They are accomplished climbers and can sometimes be found in bushes or trees.This snake is diurnal, meaning it is most active during daylight. It feeds on a variety of prey including small mammals, birds, bird eggs, lizards, other snakes and amphibians. This species is a visual hunter and can move very fast, which enables it to chase down other fast moving prey, such as lizards.This species is very nervous, and, if threatened, will make every attempt to escape. If captured they will strike and bite repeatedly, but, again, they are non-venomous.Ihopethisanswersyourquestion,andthankyou for contactingAskanExpert.Jim",

        "response":"I have little doubt that a lawn type tall fescue will to fine at your location. This is a cool season perennial grass often used for athletic fields because of it toughness, and the forage varieties are grown for irrigated pastures (they are too tall for lawns). Getting snow cover is great for the protection of the plants, as it provides insulation against brutally desiccating cold...often cool season grasses will remain green below snow cover all winter long, if not frozen first. Where I live, we often have -20 to -30F without snow cover and all the common cool season lawn grasses survive. The fescues typically prefer plenty of sunand moderate summer temperatures, but will survive higher summer temperatures.The question of sod vs seed is covered at the link below. I believe that if you get healthy sod, prepare and lay it properly, have adequate irrigation and a open fall so that the sod can get rooted in the mineral soil you should be fine. Fall is also a great time to establish a lawn from seed.....The same caveats apply however, good seedbed, adequate quality seed, proper seeding and irrigation..... https:\/\/web.extension.illinois.edu\/cfiv\/homeowners\/070420.htmlYou will want to select the most appropriate variety of tall fescue for your lawn. The forage types will not produce the kind of lawn that I believe you want.http:\/\/horticulture.oregonstate.edu\/content\/tall-fescueGood luck with your project.",

Males, tend to have a longer, thicker tail than females. Experienced reptile breeders can be pretty accurate using this method, but the most accurate method is to use snake sexing probes to determine whether or not hemipenes, the male snakes reproductive organs, are present. Again, experience in performing this procedure is very important. If you have never been trained on how to use sexing probes, I recommend that you contact an experienced reptile vet for instruction.I hope this information helps, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

Until (1) you remove all roots or (2) the fungus decomposes all of the subterranean fibrous tissue, youre going to see these mushrooms.  You can explain everything in the garden with two words:  food and sex.  The below-ground part of the fungus is eating\/surviving on the decaying rootswhich it is helping decay by breaking it down.  The above-ground structure, called the fruiting part of the organism, has sporesakin to seeds in flowering plantswhose purpose is to continue the species.  (Fungi are not plants.  They cannot make their own foodlike animalsand they have their own Kingdom.)

    "title":"Due animal poisons become non-toxic after being metabolized?",
    "title-question":"Due animal poisons become non-toxic after being metabolized? We frequently hear about secondary poisoning when a scavenger eats an animal that's been killed by poison.  Is the secondary poisoning caused by surplus poison within the dead animal (assuming there is undigested poison that remains)  or is the poison, which actually killed the dead animal, still lethal for other animals which may consume it as they scavenge the dead animal's organs?  I imagine the answer may be yes, in that there's most likely always surplus or unmetabolized poison which remains in the dead animal.  In chemistry we frequently see that a compound's radical is delivered to a reaction and enters into the reaction which changes its properties, however, that's not the case for a catalyst which emerges unchanged from the expedited reaction it has caused",

        "response":"The way I look at it, primary poisoning occurs when an animal dies due to ingestion of a toxicant.  That can be a toxicant placed in the environment, or an unmetabolized toxin still in a victim.  For example, there used to be severe secondary hazards from strychnine poisoned ground squirrels.  The squirrels died quickly from strychnine poisoning, but died with active toxicant still in their cheeks and gut.  Then a coyote or other animal eating the squirrel would ingest the toxicant and be affected.  The coyote was still eating the poison directly, even though it was in its prey.There are toxicants that retain their toxicity after ingestion and metabolism (https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Secondary_poisoning).

Early spring varies from year to year, and region to region.  Newly planted trees are more in need of regular watering than added fertilizer.

Safeguard Aquasol (active ingredient is fenbendazole) has recently been approved for use in chickens. At least some reports say that it will treat tapeworms. (There are different species of tapeworm, so it is difficult to know which type your chicken has without some diagnostic work.)If you haven't used that dewormer, you might try it. There are other dewormers that might work, but they are not approved for use in chickens. You could get a veterinary prescription to use them off-label.You might check with your extension office to locate an avian veterinarian, or you could try contacting your state veterinary diagnostic lab. They might be able to offer more help.Good luck with your chicken!",

        "response":"This is unfortunately more common that it seems like it should be. There are many possible causes for the apparent \"biting feeling\" that your friend is experiencing. Mites on occasion will bite humans, but they will not survive by feeding on humans and there is no evidence for humans moving around large numbers of mites from one place to another (though this is commonly reported by some on the internet). The biting feelings may be neurological or dermatological and the best thing that your friend can do is to see a physician for this condition. You might suggest that since the problem does not seem to be going away even though your friend is applying insecticides (fogger) that this may not be an insect or mite issue and it would be smart to visit with a physician to see what else might cause the condition that he\/she is suffering from. Of course, any support that you can give to your friend in the way of contact with you is helpful - these conditions are often exacerbated in those individuals who are alone or ostracized because of their condition.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. The snake in your photographs is a Brown Watersnake, scientific name (Nerodia taxispilota). It is a nonvenomous species. It would likely strike to defend itself if cornered by a dog or cat, but this snake is in more danger from your animals than they are from it.Like other species of watersnakes, it is often mistaken for the venomous cottonmouth (Agkistrodon piscivorus), whose distribution often overlaps those of some of the watersnake species. Brown watersnakes are found from southeastern Virginia, through most of the coastal plains of the Carolinas, south to Florida and west to Alabama. They are found in large rivers and associated swamps, as well as reservoirs created by damming rivers and streams. They can be found in other aquatic habitats, but not as often.The brown watersnake is one of the larger species of watersnakes. Typical length is a little over 3 feet, but a maximum length of approximately 6 feet is possible. This is one of the heavier bodied watersnakes, and because older females can often lose their pattern, as seen in your photographs, and become brownish grey or mud colored this leads to them being confused with the cottonmouth.Brownsnakes feed primarily on fish, especially catfish.This species is usually not found far from water. If threatened, it immediately attempts to escape to water. This snake often basks in low hanging branches over water, where, if threatened, it simply drops into the water. If captured, however, this snake will release copious amounts of strong-smelling musk from its anal glands and bite you repeatedly until you let them go. That being said, you have to be pretty fast to catch one.Your location didn't come through with your question, but here are a couple of excellent field guides that can be useful in identifying snakes depending on where you live:Gibbons, Whit. (2017). Snakes Of The Eastern United States. Athens: The University of Georgia Press.Gibbons, Whit and Mike Dorcas. (2015). Snakes of the Southeast. 2nd edition. Athens: The University of Georgia Press.I hope this answers your question. Great photos by the way. Thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"This is what I have found on the National Center For Home Food Preservation Website: Can Splenda (sucralose) be used in preserving food? \t\t\t\t\t  Granular Splenda does not provide preservative properties like sugar.                Canning Fruits:  Whereas we do not have published  research work with using sucralose in the canning of fruits at home  available to us, it is possible to use it for sweetening the water used  to cover fruits when canning.  The texture and color preserving aspects  of a sugar syrup will not be provided. The result would be like canning  in water except for the additional sweetness contributed by the  Splenda.  The USDA fruit canning directions do allow for canning in  water (i.e., without a sugar syrup), as there is adequate preservation  for safety from the heat of proper canning. Some people do notice an  aftertaste in other products and canned fruits, and it is possible some  little changes in natural flavors may occur over storage time, since  sugar can mask some of these. For people used to sucralose sweetening  and flavors, the aftertaste may not be an issue.  Based on some of our  experiences in canning peaches and pickled foods, we suggest you start  seeing what you like by trying less than a full substitution for the  sugar in canning syrups.  For example, if you use a medium sugar syrup  that is 5-\/14 cups water to 2-1\/4 cups sugar, try 1 to 1-1\/4 cups  Splenda the first time.  You can always sweeten more when you serve the  finished product if it is not quite sweet enough; then you can increase  the canning liquid amount the next time you can. In short--your pears might turn brown after preservation and develop an unpleasant aftertaste. It would be better to preserve them in a light syrup and drain off the juice before eating.",

What is missing is what, if anything, has been placed near eithor or both may have leached into the structure.  This is why some experts recommend installing a liner of plastic to block that.  Just be sure that it doesnt come up so far that the black plastic doesnt fry any plants near it.  The other concern I would have is whether the basin drains well enough, but drilling a few more holes may remedy that.  Here is a good article on the topic, generally:  https:\/\/www.extension.purdue.edu\/new\/ho-200.pdf  As to the cats.  There are serious concerns about growing edibles in outdoor litter boxes.  Fecal material may carry parasites; urine is high in nitrogen.  I would suggest removing any contaminated soil before replacing with potting soil, and using one or more of the techniques in the following article to prevent further use:  https:\/\/www.unce.unr.edu\/areas\/southern\/files\/pdf\/columns\/KeepingCatsOutOfGarden.pdf    It is unlikely that pathogens from the cats will have permeated over 2 feet of soil that is there, or that they can migrate upward into fresh soil, but an ounce of caution... may suggest a plastic liner as well.

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question.  Unfortunately, you missed the window (November through dormancy) when applications of insecticides will not also kill any pollinating insects, including bees.  You undoubtedly know that pollinator populations are in great jeopardy because of the use of insecticides during their active pollinating times.  Here is an article about the control of the aphids that cause the leaf curl: http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/r611301811.html Having insects that eat (predate on) the aphid is a biological control that does not harm pollinators. Even the organic need oil will kill pollinators on which it lands.Note that many of the chemicals mentioned are not available to home orchardists.  I suggest you contact your county Extension office (http:\/\/cesantaclara.ucanr.edu\/Programs\/contact\/) for other suggestions. Good luck!",

        "response":"Thank you for your question.  When a plant produces pollen is a complex interaction between DNA, hormones and an acid (Gibberellic), the interplay of which is still being researched.  I can send you links to articles on each of these, but there is no easy 'cocktail' to apply, and I know the topic is above my pay grade.It is probably cheaper to purchase one or two plum trees which are pollinizers for your varieties.  I don't know whether you have European or Japanese varieties, but pollinizers for both are listed in the following article: https:\/\/s3.wp.wsu.edu\/uploads\/sites\/2076\/2017\/06\/C105-Pollination-of-Fruit-Trees-15a.pdf If you have a variety not listed, a web search for \"XYZ plum pollinizer\" will get you the answer.

    "title-question":"Suspected Mite Infestation. Hello,I've been battling some sort of bug infestation in my room for about 2 years now which I think are some sort of mite. I experience bites on my skin that are singular and look similar to mosquitobites. I get bit at anytime of the day, while I'm sitting at my desk at work, in the car, or in my sleep (as I'll wake up with bites).Over the past two years I have been able to drastically reduce the amount of bites I get, at times being bite free for almost a month by washing all of my clothing and bedding all at once and taking a shower. But, they always seem to come back.I discovered that they seem to live where I was storing my clothes, in a wooden armoire in my room. Whenever I seem to eradicate the bug, I would store my cloths in the armoire, put on a shirt, and immediately get a bite. Once I get that first bite, they seem to infect all the clothes I'm wearing. Then, I will remove my clothes, put them in a dirty clothes hamper, and then all the clothes there would get infected. Then, I would lie down in my bed, and my bedding would get infected. From there, I would get bites multiple times a day.To combat this, I would wash all clothing and bedding all over again, and store my clothes in plastic bins. The bug seems to not like the plastic, and when I store clothes in there after washing them, they would not get re-infected.I know they are not mosquitos, bed bugs, or scabies because I work in an windowless office building, and I will be sitting there, and will experience a bite, look around and will not find any bugs on me. And there is only one bite and not a cluster like scabies. I have also thoroughly checked my bedding for bedbugs and have found no evidence of droppings or bugs. I have also enclosed my mattress with a bedbug sealer, and have thoroughly washed my sheets and pillows.Some background information on where I live; I live in a house with 2 other adults who live in separate rooms, and they have never gotten a bite. We have a dog that gets washed regularly, and whom I have contact with often, but have never noticed a bite after touching it. We have also had a rat infestation in the attic that has since been dealt with by a terminator. Again, no other adult living there has ever gotten a bite like the ones I'm experiencing.Over the past 3 years, I have found the suspected bug crawling on me, and on two occasions I have been able to put it on a piece of tape, but I did not preserve it properly. What happened was, I put on an infected shirt, sat down and started reading my smartphone. As I was reading my phone, a bug crawled off my hand on onto my phone. It was roughly about half a millimeter to a millimeter in size, and transparent in color. The only reason I was able to see it with the naked eye was because my phone backlit the bug and made it easier to see. That was about 6 months ago, and I'm going to see if I can send the sample out to a laboratory for identification. But since I didn't preserve it properly, I don't have much hope it will be able to be identified.Do you have any idea what kind of bug I might be battling, and is there anyone you would recommend I turn to for help to eradicate the infestation? Any information would be greatly helpful. Thank you!",

        "response":"To whom it may concern,You will need to capture a specimen in order to move forward with pest management. All the usual suspects (common biting pests in the home); bed bugs, fleas, mosquitoes, mites; can usually be seen with the unaided eye. Biting mites in the home, such as those that feed on rodents or birds, can bite humans but will not survive without their primary hosts, so management involves the location and removal of these hosts (you mentioned rats) and their nests.No professional, whether medical or entomological (like me), can identify biting pests based on dermal symptoms ('bites') alone. A specimen must be produced and identified. If a specimen cannot be produced, and if symptoms persist, then other causes of the dermatitis must be considered. I suggest you share any collected specimens with your county's vector control services district and \/ or the UC Cooperative Extension Master Gardener program for free pest ID and management info.

It seems like it's the lower branches where the leaves are dropping off after the leaf turns a complete orange.

It's possible it could be the Pacific gopher snake, scientific name Pituophis catenifer.It appears that the only native species of rattlesnake in Sonoma County is the Northern Pacific Rattlesnake,Crotalus oreganus oreganus.I can tell you that the scale pattern on the head portion of the shed skin is not a Crotalus species.Finding a shed skin is just an indication that a snake was in the area. It doesn't necessarily indicate the snake has taken up residence. Whether or not the snake remains in the area depends on availability of prey and suitable habitat for the particular species.I hope this information helps, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

As a nutritionist, I cannot make medical diagnoses, but this sounds to me like a horse who has painful gastric ulcers. Only your vet can make that diagnosis officially, but I strongly suggest an evaluation.Enteroliths are typically formed in the large colon. It can take food a horse eats several hours (even a whole day) to reach the large colon, so it is doubtful that your horse would have this pain 5-10 minutes after eating. However, that doesn't mean he doesn't have them, but my first suspicion is ulcers. Your vet can recommend the best course of treatment. Good luck and I hope your horse feels better soon!",

        "response":"To whom it may concern,Treatment of wood-destroying organisms should be conducted by trained and licensed pest management professionals. Local treatments, such as the borate products mentioned, can be effective if 1) the infested wood is accessible, 2) the infested wood is unfinished (no paint, varnish) and dry enough to soak up the product, and 3) good coverage of the infested wood is accomplished during treatment. These requirements, especially #3, are best met with professional knowledge and equipment. Have you requested local treatment with borates of the pest control operator who has proposed fumigation? Have you considered a second (or third) opinion \/ quote? Has the operator confirmed that the infestation is active? Exit holes and frass can be present decades after beetle activity. Marking existing exit holes, cleaning up frass deposits, and re-inspecting next year may answer this question of current activity level. As the customer, you have the power to demand such services.

    "title":"Should I remove frost-damaged branches on my Peach tree now or wait until after it bears the fruit?",
    "title-question":"Should I remove frost-damaged branches on my Peach tree now or wait until after it bears the fruit? My Peach tree suffered split bark on several branches along with the spot where one major branch connects to the trunk, (it's a deep V-type connection). The wounds oozed sap, which was washed away by the next wave of storm. The tree has a lot of small fruit, ranging from the size of a dime to a bit larger than a silver dollar. ( I counted 40 peaches on two branches, and I was planning to thin them.) Bear Valley Springs, in the mountains behind Tehachapi, CA has these late frosts &amp; ice storms most every year, so this particular peach tree has died &amp; come back from the root several times since I planted the original Nectarine tree back in 1996. It brings Amazing fruit, and I really want to save this tree with organic methods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Spraying the tree with a tea-like solution of cinnamon and cayenne pepper and using the sludge around the root base has helped with a peach-leaf-curl problem, and greatly reduced the appearance of aphids &amp; ants. Would it help to use this solution on the wounds and maybe patch them up with surgical tape or cheesecloth, ...or acrylic\/latex paint? Should I just go ahead &amp; remove the damaged material right away? ... or remove the fruit from those branches to reduce the strain on the tree &amp; wait until dormancy to remove them? ... or leave the fruit there &amp; let it come forth - if it will? I've resolved to build a cage for her so I can drape her with light fabric ahead of future spring storms (...and protect her fruit from the neighborhood deer) I'd surely appreciate your guidance.

( I counted 40 peaches on two branches, and I was planning to thin them.) Bear Valley Springs, in the mountains behind Tehachapi, CA has these late frosts &amp; ice storms most every year, so this particular peach tree has died &amp; come back from the root several times since I planted the original Nectarine tree back in 1996.

        "response":"Thank you for your prompt response, Kristena. After researching potential problems with growing peach trees, I realize that most experts would not consider this tree worth saving. So, I'm going to consider this tree my teacher. It's one of the first trees I planted when I started my garden, and I wouldn't be able to plant anything else near that diseased hole if I did remove the tree, anyway..                                                                                                                                                                                              I Removed the damaged material and sprayed the tree with a tea solution of cinnamon &amp; cayenne, and the aphids &amp; ants departed. The tree still has plenty of fruit, and I've realized that since this is a rootstock tree and it's sending up 1-2 new trunks most every year, I'll try being quicker to remove older trunks as any winter damage &amp; disease take a toll. This tree is actually replenishing itself, and I have no idea how long those roots might keep sending up new trunks &amp; giving Awesome fruit. I bought a new peach tree last week (Redhaven), so I'll plant it at a proper distance (about 70 ft SE) and apply what I've learned about protecting these babies. Thanks again, JR",

    "title-question":"Calimyrna or Capri Fig tree? Hi,I completely understand the relationship between a Calimyrna and Capri Fig. I have a home in Sacramento that has a very large fig tree, probably close to 22 feet wide and tall. It bears a ton of fruit every year consistently. But, the fruit never ripens. Some fall off as they get bigger and bigger, others will stay on a dry up on the branches and eventually fall off too.Everything that I have read says that the Caprifig is a smaller size fig that will obviously have the wasps. I have seen Caprifig tree in person. My mother in law about 20 minutes to the east has just that, because a few years ago we were talking about taking out her fig tree that she says she did not plant. She thought that it started from a bird dropping, I pulled the hardish fig from her tree on summer day and when I tore it apart it had wasps inside. Back then I did not know what that was, I just thought it was infested.My fig tree on the other hand has larger figs and I have never seen the wasps inside any of the fruit.Could it be that I have a Calimyrna fig tree and she just happens to have a Caprifig tree? Are there any specific ways that I can positively identify my tree? Or is it possible that I have a Caprifig tree that just happens to not have any wasps",

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. I assume you are asking about food as it pertains to your ball python. According to David and Tracy Barker in their book, Ball Pythons - The History, Natural History, Care and Breeding, the goal, when feeding, is to feed a single prey item large enough to create a barely discernible lump in the snake's body that lasts for two to four days. So the question is how large of a mouse or rat do I need to feed to create this specific condition? The answer is it differs for each snake, and you find out what is best for your snake through trial and error. Always start out with smaller prey and work your way up. Don't feed a prey item you suspect will be too large and work your way down. If the prey item you choose doesn't create a barely discernible lump or the lump doesn't last for two to four days, then, on the next feeding day, provide a slightly larger prey item to see what results you achieve. Of course, as your snake grows, you'll have to adjust the size of the prey.The book I mentioned above is an excellent reference for anyone interested in ball pythons. It is pretty expensive, but you may be able to get it through your local library's interlibrary loan program. Here's the full bibliography:Barker, David G. and Tracy M. Barker. (2006).

      {
        "response":"Hello,You are lucky to have such a large and beautiful tree on your property.  I believe that it would be less injurious to install a deck over the tree roots rather than a paver patio.  What you want to do is construct a raised wooden deck over the root system. Be sure to leave spaces between planks to allow rainfall to reach the tree roots. Do not cover the roots with plastic or any impervious material before installing the deck. In selecting locations for the footers, try to place them so that major roots are not damaged or cut through. Consult landscape contractors or carpenters for proper deck construction and installation. If you must cut roots, make the cuts as cleanly as possible. Cut roots are an entry point for many diseases. Whenever large roots are cut, there is a corresponding loss of branches; be prepared to remove dying branches in the future. Ideally you will attempt to not remove ANY of the root system, but in any case, never remove more than 25 percent of a root system.Make sure that water will get through the boards of the deck and to the soil beneath. You may wish to mulch the tree roots with good organic mulch and water them well prior to installing the decking.Be aware that some of the tree roots exposure to air and to rain fall is being limited by being covered by decking and try to leave at least a 12\"-18\" air space below the decking. If you are building the deck around the tree trunk, be sure to allow sufficient room for future widening of the trunk. No decking wood should actually touch the tree trunk.Finally, do what you need to do to keep the tree in good health. Do a soil test and correct for any missing nutrients prior to the steps above ending in mulching. Consult your local extension office about best management care for this particular species of trees, apply irrigation in times of extended drought and be sure to tell it that you love him\/her every day.",

        "response":"Thank you for your question.  As your prior question illustrates, the science, regulation and safety of this chemical are undergoing enormous scrutiny and debate, at local, state, federal and international levels.  Universities may be involved in some research, but largely devoted to its ability to control weeds, and to alternatives.  We do not regulate pesticide safety to humans in an area so thoroughly controlled by federal (EPA) rules, and state (California Prop 65j work.  So, since your state is at the forefront (in the US) of investigating this, I suggest you read the resources in this article:  https:\/\/www.p65warnings.ca.gov\/fact-sheets\/glyphosate  You can also consult with your county Extension office, but I suspect they, too, will send you there.

        "response":"Thank you for the information and link, Kristena. Rather than pesticide regulation, I question why, with so much information available to show glyphosate as carcinoginic, universities are not studying the effects. I think I found the answer. Three years ago, one intrepid student discovered Cornell University's deep ties with the biotech industry. He rose up in arms when he discovered that, with the help of the university, Monsanto lobbied for, and secured, protection against research on glyphosate and GMO seeds. Technology\/stewardship agreements required for the purchase of genetically modified seed explicitly prohibit research. These agreements inhibit public scientists from pursuing their mandated role on behalf of the public good unless the research is approved by industry. As a result of restricted access, no truly independent research can be legally conducted  on many critical questions regarding the technology, its performance,  its management implications, IRM [insect resistance management], and its  interactions with insect biology. Consequently, data flowing to an EPA  Scientific Advisory Panel from the public sector is unduly limited.  (Source: Landes Bioscience, Volume 1, Issue 2, March\/April 2010). That was nearly ten years ago. Meanwhile, GMO cultivation and glyphosate, which are prohibited in many countries, are now contaminating our organic crops,  livestock feed, and other products.",

        "response":"Hi and thanks for contacting Ask an Expert. There could be any number of reasons for the non-flowering raspberries. They could be newer than the other three that are producing fruit. Older plants produce more fruit. If these are newer or younger, they need time. If they are producing an overabundance of green leaves, you may have too much nitrogen in the soil. If you feel they should be producing right along with the other three then I suggest getting some phosphorus fertilizer (organic) and side-dress (put around the plants) and work in with your hands, then water in. This will take time but may help.  You did not say if they are in the same or near same location as the fruit bearing canes. If they are, my assumption is they are young and need a year before blooming.

    "title":"What is this spider?",
    "title-question":"What is this spider? I've lived in the same house in a woodsy area of Santa Clara County in CA for approx. 50 years. We have always had large black, non-web-spinning spiders inside &amp; outside the house. They appear with warming weather in spring &amp; disappear, except for a few sightings, in cold weather. They hang around bathrooms especially, have been found lurking underneath toilet seats or under toilet bowl rim. They climb well, can be fast-moving. In one old-fashioned tub, they freely run down the plug hole to get away. They are also prolific outdoors, living in structures or behind things stored on back patio. I try to catch them in a jar for release outdoors, or else I vacuum them up, if they're too high up on the wall.  We've been forced to coexist with them, so we do. What are they? The photo from the man from Marin County looked like our type spider to me. The fact that they're large and that they travel from room to room or wherever they want to, makes them disturbing. Our house is an old wooden one on a lot with very many trees, bushes, etc., and a nearby creek. I've always been curious about what type spider they might be -- a wolf spider, maybe? They travel solo, and I'm guessing we see 10 or so a week indoors. Any info would be much appreciated.",

        "response":"I would love to be able to tell you that spraying some of the \"Deer Away\" type repellents is all you need to do to keep deer off your fruit trees, but my own experience has shown me that a good 7' fence is the only sure way to keep deer off your plants. Repellents generally don't work on food plants and are too costly in the amount that would be needed for fruit trees. I have been able to get away with a 5' fence and an extra string strung at 6.5 feet (fence posts were 7' high) to fool the deer into thinking the fence was higher than it actually was for a while. But as soon as one deer braved that fence and found out the line at 6.5 feet was only a string that broke on impact, all of them were in there the next day. The only way to make a lower fence work is to either have two of them close enough together that the deer would have to make a very wide jump and risk getting caught between the two fences, or to build the fence at a 45 degree angle, again to scare them away from getting caught in it (https:\/\/www.google.com\/url?sa=i&amp;source=images&amp;cd=&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjRtbrkwJTjAhW-JTQIHYupBjQQj...)I have experimented with fencesaroundindividualtreesalso.Theyonlywork,iftheyaresturdyandproperlyankered.Itendedupbeingmoreworkthanjustfencingintheentirearea.Read more on deer protection here: http:\/\/ipm.ucanr.edu\/PMG\/PESTNOTES\/pn74117.html",

      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. There are several subspecies of gopher snake in California. Based on the location of ShastaCounty, this should be the Great Basin Gopher Snake, scientific name (Pituophis catenifer deserticola). Gopher Snakes are non-venomous. Average size of this subspecies is less than 5 feet long, and maximum lengths of up to 6 feet have been recorded.This snake feeds primarily on small mammals, such as pocket gophers, moles, rabbits and mice. They will also feed on birds and bird eggs. They are powerful constrictors.They are found in a variety of habitats, including open grasslands, mixed forests, coniferous forests, agricultural fields, marshlands and suburban homes.If threatened they will usually try to escape, or them may freeze in place and depend on their markings to make themselves difficult to spot. If the threat comes closer they may elevate their body and flatten their head and hiss loudly to intimidate whatever is threatening them.For additional information and more photos of this species and typical habitats see the California Herps webpage at:http:\/\/www.californiaherps.com\/snakes\/pages\/p.c.deserticola.htmlHope this answers your question, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

It appears to me that the damage may be due to feeding by thrips, rather than a fungal pathogen.

Cutting the plants to the ground is not necessary, but cutting away all the infected foliage certainly helps (imagine using a .  The fungus lives inside the plant before you can see the rust pustules, and once the pustules release their spores there are millions of points of inoculation.  However, as a rust, the spores don't survive long on the ground or on any other plant (rusts are VERY selective about their plant hosts), so once you cut away the host plant and destroy it (or bury it in your compost pile, away from the planting site), you can start protecting the plant parts that survive the haircut.  The fungicide should be applied to plants, as they emerge, to protect them from further infection.  There are very few fungicide products allowed in California (for homeowner application to residential property), but the BioAdvanced 3-in-1 Insect, Disease, and Mite Control product recommended by your local home store does have tebuconazole, an effective fungicide for lots of fungi. You can read the label here: https:\/\/bit.ly\/2SRh5gO. It also contains insecticide and a miticide,whichyoumayormaynotwant - something to consider if you do not have any insect or mite issues.

Assuming someone in your family or friend did not place the snake skin in your dryer, then the snake most likely entered through your dryer exhaust vent and then the dryer hose. This is the first time I have heard of this happening. Usually, the problem involves birds building nests in the vent or the dryer hose.If you want to see if the snake is still in the dryer, you, or somebody, will need to disconnect the dryer hose and check to see if the snake is still in the hose. I suspect, though, that it crawled back out. You can prevent this from happening again by placing a screen or grid cover over your vent. You can usually get these at any of the big box home improvement stores. This will keep birds and snakes out of the vent, while still permitting adequate air flow through the hose.I hope this information helps, and thank you for contacting Ask an Expert.Jim",

In the first case, closing or screening doors and windows will likely solve the issue. If you are producing them indoors, they are likely coming from potted plants receiving too much water. These do not look like drain flies, so I don't think drains or standing water are an issue for you. If you do not have plants in your home, then look for ways that the flies are entering from outside. If you do have plants, try moving the plants to another room and see if the flies are also showing up in the other room. That will confirm the plant as the source. Then just reduce watering of the plant or perhaps move the plant outside.",

    "question":"Why are the leaves curled lengthwise on my apricot tree",
    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello,In my experience, curling of deciduous tree leaves is generally attributable to a very few problems. Since you did not send a photo or very much information, I can only guess what the problem is with your tree. Here are some ideas. Please look up the damage in photos and compare the online photos to the appearance of your tree. If you wish to send more photos, I am happy to look at them.Drought and wind dessication, or any problem like root rot that limits the uptake of moisture can sometimes cause leaves to appear to be curled.Disease Leaf curl, caused by the fungus Taphrina deformans, is mainly a disease of peaches and nectarines, although it may also affect almonds andapricots. The disease occurs wherever peaches and nectarines are grown, and if not controlled can seriously weaken trees.Scab is another fungal disease that can cause leaves to roll.Powdery Mildew: Usually this is a vertical leaf roll but the leaves can also crinkle and curl up as they become infected with this fungus pathogen.Insects: Aphid feeding can result in leaf curl and deformity.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Hello, The most common problems of elephant ears are fungal or bacterial spots on the leaves.  these are characterized by yellow, or dark spots, that might ooze fluid.  The best way to avoid this is to space plants so that there is good air circulation and avoid getting the leaves wet when watering.  Brown spots on the leaves that are irregular may be due to too much direct sun.  Pythium rot can cause plants to die, which results in the bulb being soft and squishy.  . It is most common in areas with too much water and humidity and is caused by pythium parasites.  These parasites spread in water and thrive in  wet soils.  Plants affected will die quickly due to the corms rotting under ground.  If you are not sure if your plant has one of these problems, it would be best to take it to your local Cooperative Extension Office for diagnosis. http:\/\/mgsb.ucanr.edu\/Ask_a_Gardening_Question\/ Walk-ins welcome:777 E.

        "response":"Peaches are very popular fruit trees that can be grown successfully in many parts of California. They require adequate summer watering, deep and well-drained soils, high nitrogen fertility, fruit thinning, and pest control sprays to prevent peach leaf curl and brown rot.   Peach trees are short-lived trees (15-20 yr). Peaches (like nectarines) are self-fruitful (self-compatible), which means that they do not require a pollinizer tree. Plant trees 1216 ft. to 1818 ft. apart.   Calendar of Backyard Gardening Operations for Peaches   Winter Dormant Season     Spray trees with      dormant oil to control San Jose scale.  Spray fixed copper to      control peach leaf curl December 1 and February 1.  Prune out 50% of last      years wood to thin the crop, insure good shoot growth and fruiting      potential for future years.   Spring Bloom Season     Apply fungicide during      bloom to prevent brown rot, which may require 13 sprays, depending on      weather. Rainy periods require more spray.  Fertilize young trees      monthly with high N fertilizer beginning April 1. Use 0.5 lb. urea or 25      lb. manure\/appl\/tree. Mature trees need 50% more. Water fertilizer in. If      drip irrigated, do not exceed 1 oz. urea\/emitter\/mo.  Thin fruits to about      6\" apart when marble-sized. Thinning reduces fruit numbers, but      increases size, prevents limb breakage.   Summer Growing Season     Fertilize young trees      monthly. Use 0.5 lb. urea or 25 lb. manure\/tree\/appl. Mature trees need      50% more. Water fertilizer in. If drip irrigated, do not exceed 1 oz.      urea\/emitter\/mo.  Drip irrigate daily or      sprinkler irrigate about every 3 weeks.  Maintain a weed free      area around the base of the trees within 3' of the trunk with an organic      mulch 34\" deep.   Fall Harvest Season     Spray for shot hole      fungus in November before first heavy rain; use fixed copper.  Fertilize and irrigate      just after harvest.  At leaf fall, remove      and destroy or compost leaves to prevent the spread of peach scab.  Remove mummies from      tree.

I've also seen similar damage from moving houseplants around and accidentally crunching\/crushing a leaf or brushing by a sharp corner of furniture.This does not appear to be disease or insect damage. Diseases would spread and have symptoms along the margins of a lesion before the middle fell out creating a hole. Beetles would chew holes that appear lace-like. Grasshoppers and caterpillars eat like I consume a sandwich with bites from the outside. Leaf rollers cause perforations like on the lower leaf, but across the width of the leaf rather than along the length.Disease and Insect problems usually spread without a corrective action. Physical problems, like I believe this is, may replicate under similar conditions, but won't spread witout the action happening again.Hope this helps.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"This could be caused by the scab fungus. Symptoms first appear on fruit when they are half formed to nearly full-grown, about six to seven weeks after petal fall. Small, round, olive-green spots about 1\/16 to 1\/8 inch in diameter develop on the fruit. Spots are most common near the stem end on the side of the fruit exposed to the sun. Spots are superficial and slowly enlarge. They may merge to form large, irregular blotches that turn velvety, dark olive-green or black. Severely infected fruit may be stunted, become misshapen, or crack open. When fruits crack open, they are often invaded by other fungi that rot the fruit. Scabby fruit may also drop prematurely and do not ship or store well. Leaves may also be infected by scab. Small ( inch), round, and yellowish-green to yellowish-brown spots develop on the underside of the leaf. Diseased leaf tissue may dry up and drop out, leaving shot-holes. If the season is wet, scab-infected leaves usually drop early.   Another possibility is bacterial leaf spot. Black or brown spots appear on underside of leaves. Often the center falls out leaving a hole with a red halo. Leaves may turn yellow and fall. Fruits also get spots, sunken areas and cracks.   Both of these problems can be corrected with the use of a fungicide spray like a fixed copper in the fall and during the growing season.   Nectarine tree care in late spring or summer includes applications of nitrogen fertilizer. You can use urea, rotted manure or chemical fertilizer and water in well. Young trees need half as much fertilization as older, mature trees. When growing nectarine trees, practice will familiarize you with which applications work best in your nectarine orchard.   Another summer chore is thinning fruits from growing nectarine fruit trees. Thin marble sized nectarines to 6 inches apart for larger nectarines and less breakage of limbs from the weight of growing fruits. Limbs should also be thinned during winter dormancy. This helps control breakage and encourages more fruit production. Another essential element of pruning is leaving only a single trunk on growing nectarine fruit trees.   Keep the area beneath the tree weed free within a three foot span. Apply organic mulch 3 to 4 inches deep; dont put mulch up against the trunk. Remove leaves from the ground after theyve fallen in the fall.   Here are a couple of publications to check out:   https:\/\/www.dpi.nsw.gov.au\/__data\/assets\/pdf_file\/0004\/307129\/Common-diseases-of-nectarines.pdf   https:\/\/journals.ashs.org\/jashs\/view\/journals\/jashs\/132\/5\/article-p583.xml   Hope this helps!",

        "response":"Hi--Let's start with the roses.  Pruning roses isn't difficult, but describing how to do it can be confusing.  I'm going to refer you to a really good rose-pruning guide: https:\/\/web.extension.illinois.edu\/roses\/prune.cfm In San Diego, stop watering and fertilizing your roses in November or December to put them into dormancy. Prune them in January or early February, following the guidelines in the article above.Hydrangeas do fine with little or no pruning. However, if you choose to do so, here are some general guidelines: Prune after bloom in the summer and before the plant starts developing its bloom buds. Take off any dead branches, but make sure they are tan under the bark--they can look dead, but healthy branches show green when you nick back the bark a tiny bit. You can cut off some of the worst branches that are crossing and touching each other. Cut off branches that are lying on the ground. Beyond that, individual branches can be cut to the ground or to a promising side branch, node, or bud down inside the shrub. You can also prune more severely to renovate an overgrown plant, but don't remove more than 1\/3 of the plant at a time.

Fortunately for gardeners, there in no reliable basis in fact for this common belief. Scientists have not been able to reliably show any ill effects from black walnut trees planted in close proximity to other plants in field tests. According to Dr. Linda Chalker-Scott, WSU's myth-buster Garden Professor, the entire conspiracy against black walnuts has been based on two very old Extension publications, one of which has been withdrawn from circulation, and the other doesn't even exist! So as long as yourpittosporumis planted in healthy conditions and is properly maintained, it should remain healthy.

You are probably seeing a bit of a population explosion due to the earlier wet winter and spring increasing food availability for these bugs during past months. This meant that previous generations of these bugs would have successfully laid many eggs which are now the current generation of adult bugs that you are seeing. Unfortunately, that food availability is probably dwindling now so the bugs are dispersing to find food. These bugs will not live long without food and I expect that the best strategy is simply to wait it out (probably no more than a couple of weeks more). However, if these bugs are causing a real problem for you, you can contact a professional pest control company and request that they fog your property for these bugs (same process that they would do to control mosquitoes in your yard).

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"There are various reasons you might not see the mother bird return - for example, she might be aware of some sort of threat that would make it unsafe for her to return just then. You might also just not see her returning. If it is taking her awhile to find food, there may be long periods of time when she is gone, then she could come back quickly to feed and then take off again. It is more advantageous for a mother to spend time looking for food than just \"hanging out\" with the babies. Of course, it is also possible that something has happened to the mother. If she hasn't come back for a couple days, she may have been injured or killed. If that's the case, you have two options: 1) do nothing. This seems harsh but in nature, not all animals will survive. It's usually best to just let nature happen. 2) call a licensed rehabilitator. Most birds in the U.S. are protected by federal law, so it is illegal and unwise to take the babies into your home and try to feed them yourself. A rehabilitator will have the tools and resources to take care of the baby birds properly.",

If it is a young plant tying it up might help it get established, but when it is mature it won't need the support any longer. It's very dependent on the particular age, location, and other factors. But if you feel it is vulnerable then you should tie it up.",

      {
        "response":"Hello,I am not familiar with a plant called yonk. The photos look like the plant you are referring to is a type of sedum.My advice is to apply organic mulch between your plants. The soil looks compacted and dry, but your plants could be turning red if they are being over watered. Please assess the water delivery to ensure that all plants are getting watered. Dig down between your plants- all of them, and aerate the soil and lift it up. This will allow you to determine the water holding capacity of the soil Once these plants get established, they will not need much water, but till them if they are not getting at least 1 inch per week, they will languish. If you have not done a soil test, please do so and apply the needed nutrients as prescribed by the report that is returned to you. Some nutrient deficiencies will result in reddish leaf discoloration. Organic mulch and soil amendment will assist in the lateral movement of water through the soil and will help to provide a nutrient source for a healthy microbial soil.Good luck,",

      {
        "response":"Some mite species can bite humans, which typically occurs when their primary hosts (birds or rats) are eliminated from a home.  Humans are not a preferred host and there is no evidence that these mites will survive by feeding on humans alone  typically they cannot produce eggs or young when feeding only on human blood. Most mites do not live permanently on their host, instead they bite to feed on blood and then leave the host until they need to feed again during a later life stage.  There is no evidence that people move these blood-feeding mites from one location to another (home to hotel or to new home for example). Mites are very small, but not invisible. Mites are larger (0.7-1.1mm) than the width of a human hair (0.1mm) or the period at the end of this sentence (0.5 mm) and thus ARE visible to the unaided eye.       If you think you have mites in your home, you will want to capture them for identification. Try these techniques:   1)   At the moment that you feel a sharp, prickling (biting) sensation, closely examine the skin within a silver dollar size patch around where you feel this sensation. Look for objects about the size of a period in a sentence (probably not moving if biting).   2)   Using a strong flashlight, illuminate the area around entrances to the room where you believe you are receiving bites. This could be a vent, window, doorway, pipe access, or any opening in a room wall or ceiling. Mites are known to gather at entrance points to the room, with the greater number at one location making it easier to detect them.   3)   Place a flat white sheet on the bed or ground near where you feel that you are receiving bites. Periodically observe the white sheet closely for small moving objects. In low light, use a strong flashlight to light the sheet as this may encourage movement of mites making it easier to see them.   4)   Place a non-shiny, black object on the ground where you believe the mites to be. First warm the black object in the sun, or use an object that creates its own heat (computer, laptop, cell phone).  If there are mites at this location, they will be attracted to the heat (which they will think is a nearby animal) and the black color can often allow you to see them more easily.      Capturing Mites: Use a Q-tip wetted in water or rubbing alcohol to gently touch the mite or rub the skin or object surface where you see the mite. If you capture a mite, submerge the Q-tip in a bit of soapy water in the bottom of a ziplock plastic bag or plastic vial and give to an entomologist for identification.      If you cannot locate mites, you should seek help from a physician as mites may not be the cause of your skin reaction or health issue. There are other health conditions that can result in skin eruptions that appear similar to those caused by the bites of mites.",

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question.  The answer depends on the interplay between the means by which the poison in walnut tissue (juglone) breaks down so as to become ineffective, and whether high heat speeds up this degradation.  The phenomenon is described here:  https:\/\/www.extension.iastate.edu\/news\/2005\/jul\/070701.htm  So, the composting process itself will reduce or eliminate the effects of juglone on susceptible plants (https:\/\/www.pubs.ext.vt.edu\/content\/dam\/pubs_ext_vt_edu\/430\/430-021\/430-021_pdf.pdf) but only over 6 months or so.  I have been unable to find any research specific to the high temperature effect on the chemical.  However, you should proceed cautiously before adding any wood ash to your soileither directly or as a component of compostaccording to this Extension article:  https:\/\/ucanr.edu\/blogs\/blogcore\/postdetail.cfm?postnum=16789  Not knowing what your soil pH is, or what you are growing makes it difficult to give you a thumbs up or down, butI hope this is helpful.

So unless you spend 30-45 seconds on every seed making sure it catches fire, then you are going to have a hard time killing them.Althoughtakingatorch to the field maykillsomeofthem,anditcanbequitetherapeutictowatchthemgoupinflames.Killing seeds is also dangerous, because a lot of the options that can kill a seed before it germinates is going to also sterilize your soil. Your easiest solution is to give the field a good watering, let the seeds germinate, and kill them all when they are young. there are several options with chemicals you can find here: https:\/\/pnwhandbooks.org\/weed\/problem-weeds\/puncturevine-tribulus-terrestris.

When peace lily leaves turn brown from the outside of the leaf, progressing inward, it is typically a problem arising out of watering, which you can read about here: https:\/\/ipm.missouri.edu\/MEG\/2019\/1\/houseplantProblems\/If a leaf is dead throughout, it may have had some sort of insult to it while growing, or may have been hidden by other leaves, so it was unable to get light and to photosynthesize, which is what makes it 'green.'  These can be fussy plants, and their indoor care is a bit more complicated than other plants. You might also want to check for insects within the leaf sheaf, to see if aphids or thrips might be hiding there.

Typically when it is coming from the trunk it's an indicator of insects, fungi, or physical damage that the tree is defending itself against.  In your case, it sounds like the sap is coming from up high.  This could be the result of broken branches or other damage causing sap to pitch.  However, new cones also tend to produce a lot of sap, which can drop down or get dispersed by the wind (see picture below).  While this typically happens in the late spring\/summer when the cones are \"ripening\", it's not unheard of to occur in the fall too.  I recommend you look at the Doug-firs around the area where you're noticing the sap collect and keep an eye out for greenish cones or any kind of damage in the branches of the trees.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"A photograph of the \"tube attached\" would be helpful for determination of this issue. Soft shelled eggs are typically due to nutrition. Calcium is the primary mineral that makes up eggshells and when not supplied in the diet, the hen does not have the basic materials needed to make the shell. The problem is produced when whole grains or feeds deficient in minerals and vitamins make up the bulk of the laying hen diet. Thin egg shells are observed when calcium, phosphorus and vitamin D3 are not provided in diets at adequate levels. It is more often observed during periods of hot weather because calcium is conserved and retained within the hen's body less efficiently. The quality of the shells is improved by feeding a complete laying ration as the only diet. This diet supplies all nutrients in the proper proportions so the hen can produce good shells. If thin egg shells becomes a problem, it is advisable to add 2 pounds of oyster shells (as an oyster shell flour or hen-sized oyster shells) to every 100 pounds of complete layer ration. This will provide a quick remedy to the problem and should restore egg shell quality within a short period of time. After the egg shell quality is restored, the addition of oyster shell can be eliminated and the complete layer diet can then maintain good egg shell formation. It is also advisable to also add a vitamin supplement to the drinking water while the oyster shell is being added to the feed. This will help ensure that calcium and phosphorus in the diet is being properly absorbed through the digestive system and will be available for deposition as shell on the egg. http:\/\/extension.msstate.edu\/agriculture\/livestock\/poultry\/feeds-and-nutrition",

        "response":"Thank you for your question.  Burying food has long been used as a means of food disposal for thousands of years.  It is still considered a low-effort method of composting:  https:\/\/extension.oregonstate.edu\/gardening\/techniques\/do-rot-thing-choosing-using-composting-system  Fruits such as persimmons and tomatoes break dow quickly, and impact soil pH for only a short time before they are broken down by soil microbes.  Rotting meats probably have no long-term pH effect, and attract rodents.  Bones, which contain calcium (think bone meal) and phosphorus, take longer to decompose.  Calcium cannot be absorbed by plants in alkaline (7.0 and higher pH) soils.  Calcium is actually added to soil to make it less acidic (sweetens it), rather than making it more acidic.

    "answer":[
      {
        "response":"Thank you for your question. First of all, has your snake recovered from the infection? Your vet should be able to determine this. If the snake is still sick, it will probably not eat on its own. It can be difficult to get ball pythons to eat on their own, especially young ones. Your vet should be able to give you guidance on getting your snake to feed on its own. This species can be very shy and easily stressed. There are steps you can take to reduce stress, for example, ensuring you don't have the snake in a cage that's too large. A baby ball python is fine in a cage the size of a 5-gallon aquarium. Also, ball pythons need a hide box where they can conceal themselves. This will make them feel more secure. They also need appropriate temperature and humidity. The following links will take you to a care sheet and an article on feeding ball pythons, both adults and babies, that should provide helpful information:http:\/\/www.reptilesmagazine.com\/Care-Sheets\/Snakes\/Ball-Python\/http:\/\/www.reptilesmagazine.com\/Snake-Care\/Feeding-Ball-Pythons\/Ihopethisinformationhelps, andthank youforcontactingAskanExpert.Jim",

        "response":"Some antibiotics can NOT be used in hens laying eggs for human consumption. The proper use of any medication is on the label that package the medication comes in. Always follow the instructions on the label.0-days means no withdrawal time. If there is no withdrawal time, that is an indication that there is no build up of the medication in the meat or eggs of the animal receiving the medication.Information with regards to human patients: Cephalexin is not metabolized in the body. Route of elimination - Cephalexin is over 90% excreted in the urine after 6 hours by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion with a mean urinary recovery of 99.3%. Cephalexin is unchanged in the urine  Half life - The half life of cephalexin is 49.5 minutes in a fasted state and 76.5 minutes with food though these times were not significantly different in the study. Clearance - Clearance from one subject was 376mL\/min.Toxicity Symptoms of overdose include blood in the urine, diarrhea, nausea, upper abdominal pain, and vomiting. An overdose is generally managed through supportive treatment as diuresis, dialysis, hemodialysis, and charcoal hemoperfusion are not well studied in this case. Cephalexin has not been shown to be harmful in pregnancy and is not associated with teratogenicity.  Cephalexin is present in breast milk, though infants may be exposed to &lt;1% of the dose given to the mother. The effects of breast milk exposure to cephalexin have not been established and so caution must be exercised and the risk and benefit of cephalexin use in breastfeeding must be weighed. Cephalexin has not been studied for carcinogenicity or mutagenicity. Cephalexin has no affect on fertility in rats. Did find an old article that states:\"Cephalosporins, like penicillins, are a sub-group of betalactams derived from fungi (Cephalosporium acremonium) (Vaden &amp; Riviere, 2001). First-generation cephalosporins such as cephalexin are primarily effective against Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, and Klebsiella spp. Following oral administration of cephalexin to chickens, the drug is widely distributed and found in high concentrations in the bile, suggesting hepatic metabolism (Kitagawa et al., 1988). Cephalexin appears to preferentially deposit in egg yolk, and residues can be long lasting (Kitagawa et al., 1988).\"The article said that there were residues in the yolk of treated chickens after 21 days.Kitagawa, T., Gotoh, Y., Uchihara, K., Kohri, Y., Kinoue, T., Fujiwara, K. &amp; Ohtani, W. (1988) Sensitive enzyme-immunoassay of cephalexin residues in milk, hen tissues, and eggs. Journal of the Association of Ofcial Analytical Chemists, 71, 915920. \"Application of the method to CEX drug residues detected 30 ng\/mL in milk, 60 ng\/g in egg yolk, and 400 ng\/g in hen tissue.\"As far as I can tell, cephalosporin is NOT approved for use in poultry so the vet gave it off-label. He is legally liable if anyone gets sick, which is why he probably said you can never it the eggs again.The results I could find are contradictory. Since it is only one duck, you can go on the side of caution the same as the vet. Based on the results with humans I didn't see a problem, but I guess I have to cover myself too and say don't eat its eggs.",

        "response":"It may be that there is something eating your plant, however it looks more like environmental injury to me.  In the first phot, the leaf on the left is cupped, this is because the meristem in the leaf margin has been damaged while the tissue in the cent of the leaf continues to expand.  A combination of wind, heat, drought or frost could induce these effects as well as some kinds of nutrient deficiencies. There are also some plant diseases that could produce similar effects.In the second photo the injury is on the perimeter, and much of the injured, but dead tissue is still in place.  Insect feeding usually result in roundish holes, or the perimeter of the leaf eaten away with no dead tissue remaining. I noticed that the leaves are quite pale and some have interveinal chlorosis, which can be a symptom of micro nutrient deficiency as wellYou can call or visit your local Extension Office and they will have staff or volunteers that should be able to help you  with your specific issue, and they will be more familiar with conditions in your area.

    "title-question":"Italian Cypress in California dying? We have old Cypress trees and they were doing fine. In the past few years they seem to be doing poorly. There is no visible signs of disease (but I'm no expert). I wonder if they just haven't been getting enough water, but I don't know whether the degradation that I see is due to lack of water or not. The Oleanders that have been planted in between them have been getting bigger with thicker trunks, so I wonder if they may be stealing moisture to the detriment of the Cypresses. But our watering system is piped to each Cypress and has a soaker hose wrapped around the trunk of the Cypress so that the water drips directly around the base of the Cypress and doesn't spread onto the oleanders. I'm wondering if they need any minerals or fertilizer or hormone. Any thoughts appreciated",

        "response":"Thank you for your question.  I am assuming that you observed no diseases last year, that you fear will persist this season, and that the soil in both beds is healthy.  A greater risk to your plants than diseases \"jumping\" beds, is that the insects and diseases that were in the soil last year will cause problems for the tomatoes.  That is the science upon which crop rotation is based, whether home gardeners or commercial growers.  Here is a brief Extension article on the topic: http:\/\/sacmg.ucanr.edu\/Crop_Rotation\/Here is a more complex article, especially for tomatoes:  https:\/\/www2.ipm.ucanr.edu\/agriculture\/tomato\/crop-rotation\/Another way you can protect your plants is to wash all garden tools after using them in one bed, before using them in another bed. Ditto pruning shears. Hope this is helpful. Good luck!",

        "response":"Hi Barbara Jean. Our filbert area in Southern Oregon is already blooming in all varieties. I did a literature review a few years ago for an Extension agent in Utah who was working with establishing what filbert varieties would do well in their region. I know that their winter is much colder than our area so the trees might not be as far along. Try contacting Utah State University Extension agent Taun Beddes. His email istaun.beddes@usu.edu   ",
