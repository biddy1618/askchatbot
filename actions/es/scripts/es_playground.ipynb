The green sharpshooter, Draeculacephala minerva, and the red-headed sharpshooter, Carneocephala fulgida, are the primary vectors in California's Central Valley. The blue-green sharpshooter, Graphocephala atropunctata, is the most prevalent in coastal regions such as the Napa Valley. A new large sharpshooter, the glassy-winged sharpshooter was introduced into California in the 1990's. It is now prevalent in southern California and parts of the San Joaquin Valley. It spreads Pierce's disease more effectively than the other sharpshooters. Sharpshooters pick up the bacterium by feeding on symptomless plant hosts as well as infected grapes and transfer it to healthy grapes by feeding. Leaves become scorched and dwarfed, grapes may raisin, and overall vines become stunted and late in growth.\",\n",

Eutypa dieback symptoms in spring include stunted shoots and small, chlorotic, distorted leaves, which resemble those of Pierce's disease. Pruning wound cankers, however, are not associated with Pierce's disease as they are with Eutypa dieback. Phylloxera causes a decline of vines; look for phylloxera insects on roots.

Cold temperature damage causes buds, flowers, and shoots to curl, turn brown or black, and die. Foliage appears scorched because low temperatures severely dehydrate plant tissue. Bark and wood can crack or split, and whole branches or entire plants may be killed if temperatures are below those tolerated by the plant. Frost and freezing produce the same damage but occur under different conditions, and some of their management strategies differ. Freezing occurs when air temperatures are 32\\u00b0F or colder. Frost occurs when air is warmer than 32\\u00b0F but plant tissues drop to 32\\u00b0F or below because plants radiate (lose) heat into the atmosphere, especially during cool, clear nights.\",\n",
      "  \"management\": \"Choose species well adapted to the climate and seasonal temperatures for the location. To increase a soil's ability to absorb heat and warm plants, control weeds and during winter rake away mulch and keep soil bare. When frost or freezing are expected, irrigate dry topsoil at least 3 days before the cold weather to increase the soil's ability to retain heat. When frost is expected, cover sensitive plants overnight with cloth or similar material other than plastic to reduce heat loss to the atmosphere, but leave covers open at their bottom so heat from soil can help warm plants. Remove covers during the day. During freezing, covering plants is of little help unless a heat source is provided. Placing incandescent lights designed for outdoor use in the canopy may generate enough heat to prevent plants from freezing if plants are also covered. Be sure not to create electrical shock or fire hazards. Operating misters or sprinklers to wet foliage continuously and flooding beneath plants duri\",\n",

Cold injury is most likely to occur during autumn and spring, the coldest times during winter, and when temperatures decline rapidly after warm weather. Often injury is not apparent until days after a freeze and when temperatures rise. However, by the summer, new growth often replaces tissue damaged by cold during spring.
