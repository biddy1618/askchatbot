Phytophthora spores spread from tree to tree easily and rapidly in water as it moves over or through the soil and the spores persist in soil and water. Phytophthora spp. are commonly introduced into gardens and landscapes through the planting of infested nursery stock.

Overwintering eggs are laid as early as August and as late as October and November, varying with the weather. Overwintered eggs hatch in late winter or spring when hosts blossom. The immature mites migrate to leaves and feed on young foliage. Especially early in the season, European red mites are mostly found on the undersurface of leaves.

Eventually the entire plant can be killed. Eutypa dieback is most serious in coastal growing areas because weather there favors dispersal and infection of the fungus.

They have 8 legs and 2 body parts\\u2014an abdomen and a combined head and thorax. They lack wings and antennae. Spider families vary by body shape, web type, hunting or other behavior, and the arrangement and relative size of their eyes. Cellar spiders have long, skinny legs and hang upside down in dark corners, often indoors, sometimes bouncing when disturbed. The marbled cellar spider, Holocnemus pluchei, is shown here. Cobweb spiders hang upside down in sticky, irregularly spun webs waiting for prey. Most cobweb species are small and harmless, such as this Theridion dilutum. Western black widow, Latrodectus hesperus, is the most well-known cobweb spider. Most black\",\n",

They have two pairs of thin legs protruding from their head (wider) end. They resemble other Aculops species of the same coloration. Except for when the mites are found in abundance on fuchsia, they can be discriminated to species only by expert preparation and examination of microscopic characters. Eriophyids develop through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The protonymph and deutonymph are sometimes respectively called larva and nymph.

Brown soft scale prefers broadleaf evergreens, but it can occur on the leaves and twigs of almost any broadleaved plant. Brown soft scale females are oval, slightly convex in profile, and yellowish to dark or light brown. Mature females are 1/10 to 1/6 inch long. The scale occurs on leaves or twigs and rarely on fruit. Citricola scale resembles brown soft scale and both species can occur on citrus and hackberry (Celtis species). However, citricola scale has only one generation per year so its individuals are uniform in size unlike the differing age (size) in colonies of brown soft scale. Citricola scale occurs on leaves only during the summer and fall and on twigs in the late fall, winter, and spring. Brown soft scale is present on twigs throughout the year and on leaves when present, such as overwinter on evergre\",\n",

Adults are blackish to dark brown, oblong, hard-bodied insects about 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) long, somewhat larger than most species of bark beetle.

Dead leaf areas may be more irregular on hosts such as ash. Chinese elm anthracnose, Stegophora ulmea, also called black leaf spot, is a serious disease in coastal areas of California. Fungal infection causes foliage to develop irregular, black, tarlike spots and leaves drop prematurely.

Hosts include Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, larch, pine, and spruce. Adelgids commonly occur beneath cottony white or grayish wax they secrete or inside of galled plant tissue. The adelgids themselves are small, dark, soft-bodied, oval insects. The insects can look different depending on the host, and several different-looking stages of the same species can occur together. Balsam woolly adelgid. Adelges piceae has seriously damaged or killed tens of thousands of true fir trees in the eastern United States. Inadvertently introduced from Europe, it more recently has become established in Oregon and northwestern California. This adelgid occurs only on Abies species and does not alternate hosts in the United States. The round, dark purple to black adelgids are 1\\u204425 inch long or less.

Spots on young leaves commonly have a narrow, light green or yellow margin. The spots expand and their centers turn brown and can drop out, leaving holes. The fungal disease also causes premature leaf drop, rough and corky or scabby lesions on fruit that are brown with dark purple margins and mostly on the upper surface, and small cankers on branches.

The leafhopper overwinters as nymphs on ornamental hosts such as privet, boxwood, pyracantha, etc. and as eggs on ornamental hosts and deciduous fruit trees. There are three periods of adult activity: mid-April through May, during July, and September through October. The mountain leafhopper is a slender, active leafhopper with a yellow band behind the head and a yellow spot in the center of each wing. The leafhopper overwinters in weedy fields and prefers weeds on the orchard floor. It does not prefer cherry but can infect healthy trees by feeding on infected weeds such as clover.\",\n",

First instars become yellowish and plump by late summer. In the fall, nymphs become mottled brown second instars on leaves or twigs. In late winter (about March), the second instars on twigs enlarge and become mottled gray. Mature females are mottled dark brown to gray, convex, oval shaped, and about 1/4 inch long. Brown soft scale, Coccus hesperidum, resembles citricola scale. The mature brown soft scale is smaller, about 1/6 inch or less, and yellow or dark brown, not gray. Because brown soft scale has several overlapping generations per year, different-sized life stages commonly occur at the same time.

Anthracnose and powdery mildew fungi also commonly cause discoloring and premature drop of sycamore leaves. Distinguish sycamore scale by the tiny, discolored leaf spots it causes and by the scales' cottony wax, especially on bark. The insects themselves are brown or yellow and less than 1/12 inch long. Except for the crawler stage, sycamore scale does not resemble most other scales. Adults resemble immature (wingless) thrips. The nymphs and resting-stage preadults, called cysts, are elliptical and resemble insect eggs or tiny footballs. During certain stages, nymphs produce whitish wax and resemble whitefly pupae.

At least one other species of aphid, Tamalia dicksoni, causes similar galls on the leaves of Arctostaphylos spp. shrubs. Heavily infested plants may grow slowly, but the galling is otherwise harmless to manzanita. Feeding by Tamalia spp. causes green or red, elongate to pod-shaped galls on Arctostaphylos leaves. Galled leaves commonly appear to have swollen or rolled leaf edges. Tiny, gray or greenish aphids feed by sucking on tissue within the leaf galls. These aphids feed only on manzanita. Throughout most of the year adult females (which may be winged or wingless) give birth to live young without mating. In the fall, a sexual generation of winged males and females is produced. The winged aphids disperse, mate, and the females lay overwintering eggs on bark at the base of the plant. Eggs hatch in late winter or spring and the emerging aphids walk up to the leaves, settle to feed, and initiate galls\",\n",

Determine proximity to structures, pavement, overhead lines, and underground utilities that may be damaged by growing roots. Determine how much light and heat occur at that location based on climate and nearby structures, pavement, and plants; choose species suited to those conditions. Examine the space available for growth and learn about the mature size of candidate plants. Give limbs and roots plenty of room to grow and use only plants that will fit at maturity. Most small trees should be placed at least 5 feet from structures and at least 3 feet from any paved area; larger trees should be placed even farther away. Look for overhead obstacles. Do not plant tall-growing species beneath utility lines. Utility companies prune trees that grow into overhead lines, which can severely disfigure trees and promote decay, structural failure,\",\n",

Cold temperature damage causes buds, flowers, and shoots to curl, turn brown or black, and die. Foliage appears scorched because low temperatures severely dehydrate plant tissue. Bark and wood can crack or split, and whole branches or entire plants may be killed if temperatures are below those tolerated by the plant. Frost and freezing produce the same damage but occur under different conditions, and some of their management strategies differ. Freezing occurs when air temperatures are 32\\u00b0F or colder. Frost occurs when air is warmer than 32\\u00b0F but plant tissues drop to 32\\u00b0F or below because plants radiate (lose) heat into the atmosphere, especially during cool, clear nights.\",\n",

To increase a soil's ability to absorb heat and warm plants, control weeds and during winter rake away mulch and keep soil bare. When frost or freezing are expected, irrigate dry topsoil at least 3 days before the cold weather to increase the soil's ability to retain heat. When frost is expected, cover sensitive plants overnight with cloth or similar material other than plastic to reduce heat loss to the atmosphere, but leave covers open at their bottom so heat from soil can help warm plants. Remove covers during the day. During freezing, covering plants is of little help unless a heat source is provided. Placing incandescent lights designed for outdoor use in the canopy may generate enough heat to prevent plants from freezing if plants are also covered.
