Females lay yellowish eggs in double rows of about 5 to 25 on the underside of leaves. Eggs become grayish before hatching. Larvae resemble caterpillars and are black when newly hatched and shortly after molting (shedding the old skin). After feeding, larvae become yellowish to green with rows of tiny dark tubercles (projections). Third-instar larvae grow up to 1/3 inch long and have dense rows of dark tubercles down their sides that resemble two black stripes. Pupae are orange to bright yellow. The elm leaf beetle develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults commonly overwinter in bark crevices and woodpiles or in buildings. In spring they fly to elm foliage and chew leaves, and females lay eggs. Eggs hatch into larvae that develop through three instars (growth stages) over a period of several weeks while chewing on foliage and then crawl do',\n",

You can purchase and release predatory mites to establish populations, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators--for instance, by avoiding dusty conditions and pesticide sprays. Predator mites do not feed on foliage or become pests, so must be released when pest mites are available. To establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray to bring pests to a lower level and then release predators.
