    "description": "Gregg arrowhead is a native aquatic perennial that occurs in the Central Valley at low elevations (up to 100 feet (300 m). It resembles California arrowhead and is frequently found in wet excavated areas, irrigation ditches, and rice fields where stands are thin. Seedling Seedlings are submerged. Cotyledons (seed leaves) have narrow, light green leaves that taper to a point. Rectangular markings on the leaves help distinguish seedlings from ducksalad, river bulrush, and ricefield bulrush. The characteristic arrowhead leaf-shape appears with the third or fourth true leaf. Mature plant Leaves are much narrower than that of California arrowhead. The two bottom leaf lobes are about twice as long as the front lobe, whereas the two bottom leaf lobes of California arrowhead are shorter and broader. Flowers Flowers have three white petals. Unlike Gregg's arrowhead, California arrowhead has two (rarely three) flowers at the lowest flowering stem node. Reproduction Gregg arrowhead spreads through seeds and underground stems.

    "description": "Cattails are perennial aquatic plants found in rice fields, drainage ditches, and irrigation canals. Common cattail, Typha latifolia, typically forms dense colonies in shallow water of about 1-1/2 feet (0.5 m), yet can be found growing in mud. Common cattail occurs throughout California to about 6600 feet (about 2000 m). In natural communities such as marshes, ponds, lake margins, estuaries, and wet meadows, it is a valuable source of food and shelter for wildlife. Cattail also prevents erosion and can help remove excess nutrients from water. However, it can be a problem in irrigation canals, rice fields, and other controlled aquatic systems. Seedling Seedlings are fast growing and have thick, erect, light green leaves. Stems are pithy, which distinguish them from grass seedlings. The first leaf is whitish toward the base. Common cattail: The cotyledon (seed leaf) is linear, threadlike, and usually very curved. The first leaf is whitish near the base. The first two to four leaves are hairless, linear, have a single midvein and distinct cross-veins. The next few leaves are ribbonlike and float on the water's surface. The seedling is fast growing with thick, erect, light green leaves. Mature plant Mature cattails are 5 to 10 feet (1.5–3 m) tall and topped with a characteristic cigar-shaped flower cluster or fruit. The flower-bearing, unjointed pithy stem is nearly as long as the plant's spearlike, parallel-veined leaves and large creeping underground stems. A similar species, common tule, Scirpus acutus var. occidentalis, is distinguished from cattails by its very short leaves and flowers, which are produced in loose clusters. Plants mature from July through August. Common cattails can stand about 9.8 feet (3 m) tall and are topped with a characteristic cigar-shaped flower head. The flower-bearing, unjointed pithy stem is nearly as long as the plant's spearlike, parallel-veined leaves and large creeping rootstocks. Flowers The flower head is a spike with a characteristic cigar shape. The spike becomes a cottony or velvety cluster of wind-dispersed seeds that breaks open when mature. Common cattails bloom from May to August. Tiny flowers cluster into spike flower heads that are shaped like cigars and usually reach beyond the height of the leaves. Tiny reddish to black-brown male flowers are found in the upper portion of the spike and tiny, dark, greenish brown to red-brown female flowers are found in the spike's lower portion. The spike becomes a cottony or velvety cluster of wind-dispersed seeds that breaks open when mature. Seeds Seeds germinate in April. Common cattail: Seeds are minute, roughly 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, yellowish brown, and somewhat football-shaped. Reproduction Common cattails reproduce mainly from horizontal, underground creeping stems and also by seed. Related or similar plants Western common tule, Schoenoplectus acutus var. occidentals",

    "description": "Common catsear, a perennial broadleaf plant, has seed that can germinate fall through spring depending on the conditions. In California it is found in the Northwestern region, Cascade Range foothills, northern Sierra Nevada foothills, Sacramento Valley, central-western region, and South Coast, up to 1600 feet (about 500 m). Common catsear inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed places. In turf it is usually found as a rosette. Common catsear often thrives on overgrazed pastures and rangeland, is palatable to livestock, and tolerates drought. Habitat Disturbed places such as fields, grassland, pastures, roadsides, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, gardens, and turf. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrowly egg shaped and hairless. First leaves are shaped similarly, but usually hairy, with either smooth edges or with some small teeth. Leaves alternate along the stem. Mature plant With its flowering stem common catsear grows to about 2-3/5 feet (0.8 m) tall. Leaves are lobed or sawtoothed, with coarse, yellow hairs on the upper and lower surfaces. It has a fleshy taproot. Like dandelion, Taraxacum officinale, it produces a rosette, but can be distinguished by its branched flower stems and coarse yellowish leaf hairs that are rough to the touch. The leaves are more distinctly lobed than dandelion. Flowers Common catsear blooms from May to November. Tiny yellow flowers cluster into flower heads that resemble small dandelions. Unlike dandelion, common catsear has branched flower stems and coarse yellowish leaf hairs. Fruits The single-seeded fruit is brown, narrowly football shaped or oblong, longitudinally ribbed, and has a slender attachment that ends in a tuft of stiff, white bristles that look like tiny feathers. Reproduction Common catsear reproduces by seed. In heavily grazed areas or mowed turf it can also reproduce from shoots that grow in the crown area.

It is a native species that is a common weed in rice fields and irrigation canals. Although weedy in some situations, its fruit and leaves are an important source of food for waterfowl in natural ecosystems. Seedling Leaves are narrow, succulent, light green and taper to a blunt point. Rectangular markings on leaves distinguish it from ducksalad, river bulrush and ricefield bulrush. The characteristic arrowhead leaf-shape appears with the third or fourth true leaf. Submersed seedlings look similar to Gregg arrowhead. Mature plant Leaves and flowering stems grow up to roughly 1.5 feet (0.5 m) tall. Plants grow in groups and exist both under and above water but most are above water. The leaves may vary a lot in size and shape but most exposed leaves are arrow shaped, and have two pointed lobes pointing backwards giving the the leaves the arrow shape. Gregg's arrowhead, a similar species, has much narrower and longer basal lobes. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through September. The flower stalk is shorter than the leaf length. Flowers have three white petals with a green-yellow coloring at the base of the petals. There are three flowers at all nodes, except the lowest node, which has two (rarely three) flowers.

Common chickweed is found throughout most of California, except in the Mojave Desert, up to 4300 feet (about 1300 m) and is especially common in lawns and landscaped areas. It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites. It can harbor several viruses and other pests that affect a variety of vegetable crops. Many species of wildlife feed on its leaves and seeds. Habitat Yards, turf, gardens, landscaped areas, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, grasslands, managed forests, nurseries, roadsides, and other disturbed places. Seedling Cotyeldons (seed leaves) are lance shaped to football shaped, hairless, have prominent midveins, taper to a point at the tip, and are about four times as long as they are wide. They have short stalks with sparse hairs. The first and next few leaf pairs are oval to football shaped with small points at their tips and have short stalks with a line of hairs down either side. Mature plant Common chickweed grows erect to prostrate and sometimes is matlike. Stems are mostly forked and have a line of hairs down either side. Leaves are broadly egg shaped, have a pointy tip, and are mostly hairless or have hairy margins at the base. The leaves are spaced evenly and are opposite to one another along the stem. Lower leaves are stalkless and smaller than the upper, stalked leaves. Mouseear Chickweed, Cerastium vulgatum, and sticky chickweed, Cerastium glomeratum, are very similar in appearance and growth habit, however, unlike common chickweed, both species have leaves that are moderately to densely covered with hairs. Flowers Common chickweed blooms mostly from February to September, but under favorable conditions, flowering can take place year-round. The small, yet showy, flowers have what appear to be 10 petals, but are really five deeply–cut white petals. Flowers are produced in open clusters at the end of the stem. Fruits Fruits are tiny, non-fleshy, egg shaped and contain numerous minute seeds. Seeds The tiny seed is about 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) in diameter and is pale tan to pale reddish brown. Under magnification, small wartlike projections can be seen on the surface.

Habitat Wild celery is found in vegetable crops, orchards, fields, associated with field edges and ditches, gardens, turf and landscaped areas, and other disturbed places such as railroad tracks, roadsides. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are hairless and linear and about 1/6 to 2/5 inch (4–10 mm) long and 1/25 inch (1 mm) wide. The first leaf is deeply lobed (3 lobes) with a long stalk. Mature plant The mature plant forms an erect to decumbent (prostrate stems with erect tips) mound and can grow to 2 feet (0.6 m) in length. However, it will adapt to mowing. Like the seedling it is hairless. Its leaves alternate along the stem and are deeply dissected into threadlike segments. The entire leaf ranges from 1-1/5 to 4 inches (3–10 cm) long and the leaf segments, from about 1/8 to 3/5 inch (0.3–1.5 cm). Upper leaves are stalkless and more threadlike and lower leaves have stalks ranging from roughly 4/5 to 5 inches (2–12 cm). Flowers Flowers bloom from April though August. Individual white, minute, five-petaled flowers bundle to form clusters (inflorescence) called umbels. The umbles have a flat-topped umbrella shape.. Some wild celery umbels are simple umbels, because the individual flower stalks radiate from a common point, forming an umbrella “shape”. Others are compound umbels, which form when several simple umbels cluster on a stalk. In wild celery, under each umbel are 1 to 3 rays or threadlike green bracts, less than 4/5 inch (2 cm) long. Fruit Fruit are oblong to egg shaped, slightly flattened, hairless, and 1/25 to 1/8 inch (1–3 mm) long. They have about 5 thick, angled ribs. Reproduction Wild celery reproduces by seed. Seeds disperse with water, soil, equipment, and other human activities and possibly as a contaminant in seed or feed.

    "description": "Wild carrot is an annual, biennial, or short-lived perennial broadleaf that closely resembles a cultivated carrot through the immature, rosette stage. It easily crosses with cultivated carrot and is vulnerable to the same pests and diseases. Except for the Great Basin and deserts, it is found throughout the state, especially in Northern California and coastal regions to about 5000 feet (1500 m). Nutritive value of its foliage is similar to that found in legumes and thus can benefit foraging livestock. Habitat Wild carrot is found in fields, pastures, vegetable crops, orchards, roadsides and other disturbed places. It is typically found in sandy or gravelly soils. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are linear, hairless, and roughly 4/5 inch (20 mm) long and 1/25 inch (1 mm) wide. The first leaf is divided into 3 lobes. True leaves alternate along the stem and have a lower surface with hairless to sparsely hairy veins and edges. Leaf stalks are long and generally have rows of short bristly hairs. Wild carrot seedlings look like those of common yarrow, Achillea millefolium. At the young plant stage when they form into rosettes, differences in leaf hairs can be used to easily distinguish the two plants (see “Young plant”). Young plant The young plants exist as a rosette of basal, fernlike leaves with long stalks during the first year or until the flowering stem develops at maturity. Although similar as seedlings, wild carrot rosette leaves are almost hairless or have short, bristly hairs, whereas leaf hairs of the common yarrow rosette lay mostly flat against the leaf surface. Leaves range from approximately 2 to 6 inches (5–15 cm) in length and are finely divided 3 to 4 times into segments that are roughly linear to lance-shaped in outline. Mature plant At maturity the flowering stalks bolt upward. They are erect, round, longitudinally ridged, bristly-haired, hollow, sparingly branched, and reach up to 4 feet (1.2 m). Both basal and stem leaves are subdivided into “lacy” or “feathery” leaflets giving them an overall fernlike appearance. The basal rosette leaves have long stalks whereas the stem leaves have short to no stalks. Leaves range from approximately 2 to 6 inches (5–15 cm) in length and are nearly hairless to bristly-haired. Crushed leaves and broken roots have a carrot scent. Flower Flowers bloom from May through September. Many tiny white flowers bundle to form an inflorescence about 2 to 4 inches (5–10 cm) in diameter. Numerous flower-cluster stalks radiate from a common point forming an umbrella “shape” and are called compound umbels. The individual flowers have 5 white petals with lobed tips unequal in size. The central-most flower is sometimes dark red to purplish. Under each umbel are feathery looking leaflike bracts that are finely dissected into liner or threadlike segments. Fruit As the fruit matures, the clusters curve inward and the umbels become concave, then flat. The tiny fruit are somewhat egg shaped, slightly flattened, and mostly 1/8 to 1/6 inch (3–4 mm) long. They are widest at the middle with 5 narrow bristly, longitudinal ribs. Eventually fruit separate into 2 parts each containing one seed. Seeds Seeds are tiny with one flat side and a rounded side that is ridged and bristled. Reproduction Wild carrot reproduces by seed, which fall near the parent plant, but disperse with water, mud, as feed and seed contaminants, and clinging to humans and animals.

It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas and is a common weed in artichoke fields on the Central Coast and in irrigated landscapes. It is related to, and closely resembles, creeping woodsorrel, Oxalis corniculata. Both species contain variable levels of oxalate compounds that can cause death in livestock when consumed in large quantity. They are attractive but are a nuisance when they spread into gardens or when they infest shrubs. Sometimes Bermuda buttercup is grown as an ornamental. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, crop fields, grassland, yards, gardens, turf, landscaped areas, and urban areas. Seedling Seedlings are not encountered in California. Mature plant A loose basal rosette of leaves up to about 14 inches (35 cm) tall grows from the bulb. It has fully subdivided (compound) leaves, each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets that resemble clover leaves. Leaves are hairless to sparsely hairy, green, often with brown or purplish spots. Stems are located mostly below ground. It can be distinguished from creeping woodsorrel by its more upright growth, larger leaves and flowers, greater number of flowers, and lack of seed capsule. Flowers Flowers bloom from November through April. Flowers cluster on the ends of slender leafless stalks and there are less than 20 flowers per cluster. Each flower has 5 bright yellow petals.

Like its relative littleseed canarygrass, it is a common weed in grain fields, including rice. Habitat Hood canarygrass is found in winter crops, grain/rice fields, alfalfa fields, seasonally wet sites, moist and dry disturbed sites, roadsides, and ditch banks. Seedling Seedlings grow erect and have a characteristic red base. As tillers develop the seedling becomes semi-prostrate. Leaves are rolled in the bud. Mature plant This tufted grass grows upright to 3-1/3 feet (1 m). Leaves are flat, hairless, and range from mostly 1/5 to 1/3 inch (5–7 mm) wide whereas the leaves of the similar littleseed canarygrass range mostly from 1/5 to 3/5 inch (5–15 mm) wide. However, both grasses can be as little as 1/12 inch (2 mm) wide. Stems are round in cross section. Sheaths are open, narrow, and membranous along the upper margins. However, sheaths enveloping the flowering stem frequently look inflated and usually enclose the lower portion of the flower clusters (inflorescence). Collar The collar is frequently pale. Auricles are absent. Ligules are membranous and delicate, usually 1/8 to 1/4 inch (3–6 mm) long, and truncate at the tip. Littleseed canarygrass ligules are typically 1/5 to 2/5 inch (5–10 mm) long and range from pointed to truncate at the tip. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through August. Tiny flowers cluster to form densely packed inflorescence along the top of the flowering stem. The inflorescence looks like a spike, but on a close look they are panicles because flowers tightly bundle along tiny branches. The spikelike panicle is more or less oblong and about 1-1/5 to 3-1/2 inches (3–9 cm) long and about 2/5 to 4/5 inch (1–2 cm) wide and its base usually tapers to an inflated sheath. Each spikelet cluster is composed of a fertile spikelet surrounded by 5 or 6 infertile spikelets that all detach as a unit (see photo above). The similar looking littleseed canarygrass panicles are 2/5 to 2-4/11 inches (1–6 cm) long and 2/5 to 1/12 inch (1–2 cm) wide and their spikelets detach separately. Fruits Fertile florets are lance shaped about 1/12 to 1/6 inch (2–4 mm) long and have 2 tiny scale-like sterile florets at the base. Reproduction Hood canarygrass reproduces by seed, which generally falls near the parent plant.

Although considered desirable members of natural habitats, they can be weedy in managed urban and agricultural sites. Two species of willowherbs common in California are the perennial fringed willowherb, E. ciliatum, and tall annual willowherb, E. brachycarpum, a summer annual. Fringed willowherb is found throughout California to 13,500 feet (4100 m). It inhabits moist or dry disturbed areas in plant communities including those in meadows and wetlands, in agricultural areas, wet and moist sites, and nurseries. Tall annual willowherb is found throughout California, except for the Channel Islands and deserts, to 11,000 feet (3300 m). It inhabits dry, open sites in many plant communities, unmanaged, disturbed areas, landscaped areas, and agricultural sites. Habitat Fringed willowherb–many plant communities, meadows, wetlands, streambanks, ditches, irrigation canals, nurseries, orchards, vineyards, and landscaped areas. Tall annual willowherb–fields, agronomic crop fields, orchards, vineyards, forestry sites, and roadsides. Seedling In both fringed willowherb and tall annual willowherb, leaves are initially opposite to one another and sometimes are tinged red. Fringed willowherb: Cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped with a rounded to slightly squared tip and hairless. The first true leaves are oval. Tall annual willowherb: Cotyledons are broadly egg shaped to almost round, approximately 1/8 to 1/5 of an inch (3–5 mm) long and wide, hairless, with a slightly squared tip. The first true leaves are oblong football shaped, about 2/5 to 3/5 of an inch (10–14 mm) long and approximately 1/8 to 1/5 of an inch (3–5 mm) wide, hairless, and with edges that sometimes have weak teeth. Mature plant Fringed willowherb is a loosely clumping plant usually with more than one stem from the roots that branch in the upper portion. Stems are weakly woody but not peeling at the base as occurs in tall annual willowherb, and sometimes reddish. The mature plant can grow to about 6-1/2 feet (2 m) tall. Leafy rosettes are usually found at the base of the plant. Leaves are lance shaped or football to egg shaped, range from about 2/5 to 6 inches (1–15 cm) long, sometimes tinged red, have short stalks or no stalks, and usually have serrate edges. Leaves are opposite to one another along the base of the stem and generally are alternate to one another above it. Lower leaves are hairless or hairy, while upper leaves are sparsely to densely hairy. Upper leaves do not have clusters of smaller leaves where their stalks meet the stem (axils) as is found in tall annual willowherb. Tall annual willowherb grows erect and usually has one main stem that branches in the upper portion, is weakly woody, and peels at the base when mature. Branches grow ascending (sloping upward) to almost straight and are nearly hairless, except for the tips, which often have some glandular hairs. The plant can grow to about 6-1/2 feet (2 m) tall. Leaves are narrowly football shaped, mostly 2/5 to 2 inches (1–5 cm) long, nearly hairless, often fold upward, have no stalks or very short stalks, and have edges that are smooth or have a few small teeth. Often the upper leaves have clusters of smaller leaves where their stalks meet the stem (axils). Flowers Flowers have four, white to violet-pink notched petals, which are produced at the end of long, slender stalks that attach along the flowering stem forming a flower head. Fringed willowherb flowers bloom from June through September. The flowering head is covered sparsely to densely with hairs that are sometimes glandular, and leaves remain attached to it. Tall annual willowherb flowers bloom from May through September. Flower heads are nearly hairless and have very few leaves. Flower stalks generally have some glandular hairs. Fruits Fruits consist of slender, straight, cylindrical capsules with four chambers. Capsules eventually split open and peel back, exposing the seeds. Fringed willowherb: Capsules are 3/5 to 4 inches (1.5–10 cm) long, hairy, and stalkless or have long stalks. Tall annual willowherb: Capsules are 3/5 to 1-2/5 inches (1.5–3.5 cm) long, hairless or have glandular hairs, and have long stalks. Seeds Seeds are egg shaped, flattened, and end in a tuft of long, soft hairs. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Wild cucumbers, also called man-roots, are perennial broadleaf vines. Plants are named for their very large underground stem or for their distinctive greenish, round to oblong fruit capsules that contain seed. They inhabit open areas in forests, woodland, shrubland, and riparian areas throughout much of California, except the Mojave and Sonoran deserts and Great Basin, to 6000 feet (1800 m). Above ground growth may die back in the summer if water is limited. Several native Marah species occur in California and are not considered weedy in natural systems. These include Cucamonga man-root, Marah macrocarpus, and Marah oreganus. Cucumis myriocarpus, which is also sometimes called wild cucumber because it has somewhat large green fruit. Habitat Open sites in forests, woodland, shrubland, and riparian areas. Seedling Marah seedlings develop a several-inch-long, swollen tuber underground before producing any green leaves. Mature plant Wild cucumbers grow from a large underground stem tip and have clinging tendrils that climb, entwining shrubs and trees. Each leaf is several inches in diameter and has five to seven lobes that are sometimes toothed or shallowly lobed once again. Flowers Flowers are cup or star shaped and white. Early in the season flowers are found singly. As the season progresses flowers are found in groups. In comparison with Marah species, the similar looking Cucumis species’ flowers are larger, 4/5 to 2-2/5 inches (2–12 cm) wide, and occur singly or with just a few flowers each usually at a separate node. Marah species flowers are smaller, 4/5 of an inch (2 cm) or less wide, and male flowers occur in clusters. Fruits Fruits consist of capsules that contain seed. Depending on maturity and species, these Fruits are 1-1/5 to 8 inches (3–20 cm) long. Cucumis species Fruits are covered with weak prickles while Marah species Fruits are sparsely or densely covered with straight or hooked prickles. Reproduction Wild cucumbers grow from a large underground stem and have clinging tendrils that climb up and entwine shrubs and trees. The can also be spread by seed; the fruit ejects the large seeds when ripe. Related or similar plants Cape ivy, Delairea odorata",

    "description": "Common waterplantain, a perennial aquatic broadleaf plant, can behave as an annual in California rice and wild rice fields. It is found throughout California, except in the Mojave and low deserts (Sonoran) and the Great Basin region up to 5200 feet (1600 m). Common waterplantain grows in shallow water and exposed mud in and around wetlands, streams, rice and wild rice fields, and ponds. It is particularly a problem in rice fields where the stand is sparse and cold water enters. Although seeds are the most common source of new plants, plants are able to regenerate from the bulbous base, creating problems where fields have been inadequately plowed. Beneficial to wildlife, common waterplantain is usually only considered a weed in controlled aquatic systems and rice fields. Habitat Wetlands, streams, rice and wild rice fields, and ponds. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are football to lance shaped, about 2-1/2 to 3 times as long as broad, with long stalks that are often reddish-tinged. They usually float on the water surface. Immature leaves are bladeless or have very reduced blades. Seedlings may be confused with upright burhead because their cotyledons also float on the water. However, young burhead plants are usually covered with water and have stalkless leaves, whereas seedling waterplantain leaves are stalked. Mature plant Mature common waterplantain grows in clumps with most leaves rising above the water surface and some floating. Leafless flowering stems grow to about 4 feet (1.2 m), extending well above the leaf blades that can grow to over 1-1/2 feet (0.5 m) tall. Leaves are variable in shape, from lance to egg shaped. Leaf blades are about 2 to 8 inches (5–20 cm) long and have parallel main veins and transverse tiny veinlets. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through July. The flowering stem is much taller than the leaves and has four or more whorls of flowers that attach at the stem joints (nodes). Beneath each node are 2 to 3 papery, leaflike structures (bracts). Flowers have three white (rarely pink) petals with rounded tips and smooth or jagged edges. Three to ten flowers comprise a whorl. Fruits The fruiting head consists of a dense ring of one-seeded fruit (achenes). Achenes are strongly compressed, longer than wide, have rounded backs, and a short beak on the opposite side. Reproduction Reproduces mostly by seed, but to a limited extent reproduce from side shoots. Related or similar plants Upright burhead, Echinodorus berteroi",

    "description": "Creeping woodsorrel is a low growing perennial broadleaf plant with shamrock-like leaves. It grows throughout California to 8200 feet (2500 m) and inhabits agricultural land, greenhouse and other disturbed sites. It is related to, and closely resembles Bermuda buttercup (buttercup oxalis). Both species contain variable levels of oxalate compounds that when eaten in quantity, can cause death in livestock. Bermuda buttercup prefers shady conditions but can grow in sun. Habitat Yards, gardens, turf, landscaped areas, urban places, orchards, vineyards, fields, and agricultural crops, and nursery and greenhouse grounds and containers. Seedling The cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to egg shaped and hairless, except for minute hairs along the edges that point upward. They range from 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm) long and 1/25 to 1/10 of an inch (1–2.5 mm) wide. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The first leaf has three leaflets that are broadly heart shaped. Mature plant The mature plant is low growing. Its creeping, aboveground horizontal stems grow to about 12 inches (30 cm) long and root at the stem joints (node) allowing it to invade new areas. Leaves resemble those of clover and range from green to dark purple-tinged. Hairless to sparsely hairy, leaves are fully subdivided (compound), each consisting of three heart-shaped leaflets that are 1/4 to 2/5 of an inch (0.6–1 cm) long and 1/6 to 1 inch (0.4–2.5 cm) wide. In comparison to the leaves, leaf stalks are long, almost 3 inches (7 cm) in length. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem and usually fold downward at midday and at night. Leave are gernally green but a variant with purplish leaves is also common. Flowers Flowers are present almost year-round. Two to five yellow flowers form a cluster that develops where leaf stalks and stem meet (leaf axil). The small flowers have five yellow petals. Creeping woodsorrel has less upright growth and less showy flowers than Bermuda buttercup, a similar looking plant. Fruits Fruit consist of green cylindrical capsules (similar to pods) that either have five weak lobes or are angled and attach to stalks that stand erect or curve downward. Each capsule ranges from 1/4 to 1 inch (0.6–2.8 cm) long and contains a few to numerous seeds. Seeds Seeds are egg shaped, flat, brown, have transverse ridges, and are roughly 1/16 of an inch (1.6 mm) long. When seeds mature, capsules open explosively, often spreading seeds 10 feet (300 cm) or more. Reproduction Seeds and creeping aboveground horizontal stems that root at stem joints (nodes).

    "description": "Common yarrow is a perennial broadleaf plant with an extensive system of underground creeping stems. This species is comprised of a complex of highly variable biotypes and is found throughout California, except in deserts, to 11,500 feet (3500 m). It inhabits turf, landscaped areas, and pastures. In mowed situations, such as turf, flowers may not be observed. Common yarrow occurs in cool climates and in areas of frequent irrigation. Usually common yarrow is considered a desirable member of natural communities. Some cultivars are grown as ornamentals in landscapes. However, because of its creeping habit and ability to establish seedlings, it can be weedy in landscaped areas and turf. Habitat Common yarrow is found in many plant communities such as those in coastal bluffs, sand dune, salt marshes, grasslands, semi-deserts, and alpine areas. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oblong to egg shaped, about 1/8 to 1/6 of an inch (3–4 mm) long and roughly 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) wide. The first true leaves are divided with sharply pointed teeth. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The first leaf is deeply cut into linear segments. Common yarrow seedlings look like those of wild carrot, Daucus carota. At the young plant stage when they form into rosettes, differences in leaf hairs can be used to easily distinguish the two plants (see “Young plant”). Young plant Until the flower stem develops in late spring or summer, plants exist as rosettes. Leaves of young plants have a fernlike or feathery quality. Although similar as seedlings, common yarrow rosette leaf hairs lay mostly flat against the leaf surface, whereas wild carrot rosette leaves are either hairless or short and bristly. Mature plant Mature plants grow low to the ground in clumps. The flowering stem is usually about 3-1/3 feet (1 m) tall. Leaves are finely cut into linear segments giving them a feathery appearance and are hairless or have soft hairs. Common yarrow can be distinguished from other weeds that have finely cut leaves by its creeping belowground horizontal stems. Rosette leaves and leaves low on the stem are about 4 to 8 inches (10–20 cm) long, while leaves above are smaller, stalkless, and clasp the stem. Flowers Bloom takes place from March through September. Small white or yellow flowers cluster into dense, flat-topped flower heads at the ends of stems. Fruits Fruits are roughly 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) long, narrowly oblong to lance shaped, flattened, ribbed longitudinally and do not open at maturity. Each fruit (achene) contains one seed. Reproduction Common yarrow reproduces by seed and by sprouting from underground horizontal, creeping stems (rhizomes).",

    "description": "Velvetleaf, a summer annual broadleaf plant, is a problematic weed for many crops in the United States, particularly where cotton, corn, or soybeans are major crops. It was introduced to North America from southern Asia in the mid-1700s as a potential fiber crop. In California, it is found in the southwestern region and the Central Valley, especially in the Sacramento Valley to an elevation of 330 feet (100 m). It is also found in irrigated areas of the desert regions. Velvetleaf can also grow in urban environments and other irrigated disturbed areas. Because of velvetleaf’s tall growth, it can severely reduce light penetration to crop plants. It also harbors several diseases and pests of corn, cotton, soybeans, and other crops. Seeds can remain viable in soil for 50 years. If infestations are allowed to persist and produce seed, this weed can be troublesome. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, crop fields—especially agronomic and nursery crops, gardens, roadsides, and other disturbed areas. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) usually differ slightly in shape—one roundish and the other slightly heart shaped. Both are covered with soft, tiny, simple hairs. The cotyledons are about 1/3 to 1/2 of an inch (7–12 mm) long and about as wide, and often have slightly indented tips. Cotyledon stalks are long and covered densely with two kinds of hair: short, simple hairs and star-shaped hairs. The first true leaf is heart shaped with a rounded tip, and is slightly larger than the cotyledons. The next leaves are about 4/5 to 1-3/5 inches (2–4 cm) long and as wide and resemble leaves of the mature plant. Mature plant Velvetleaf stands erect and has large, velvety heart-shaped leaves with pointy tips. Stems are coarse and grow to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall or more. Leaves are densely covered with short, soft, simple hairs and star-shaped hairs, have long stalks that are about 4 to 8 inches (10–20 cm) long, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Plants have a distinct odor when crushed. Flowers Flowers bloom from July through August. They are 2/5 to 1 inch (1–2.5 cm) in diameter, have five yellow petals that are fused at the base, are stalked, and found singly or in clusters where the leaf stalk meets the stem. Fruits The fruit is a capsule (similar to a pod) that consists of a cuplike ring formed by 12 to 15 woody segments and is roughly 1 inch (2.5 cm) in diameter. The segments remain intact at maturity and each segment releases 1-3 seeds through a vertical slit on the outer face of the capsule. Seeds Seeds range from kidney shaped to almost triangular, have a notch, are flattened, and about 1/12 to 1/8 of an inch (2–3 mm) in length. They are purplish brown, brown, or black and either smooth or have tiny star-shaped hairs. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Italian thistle is a winter annual, and sometimes biennial, weed. It is native to the Mediterranean region and central Europe. It is a noxious weed in California, and is found mostly in the southern North Coast region, the Sierra Nevada foothills, the Central Coast, the San Francisco Bay Area, and the South Coast Ranges. It is also a common weed in Oregon, Washington, and Idaho. Habitat Disturbed open areas, roadsides, pastures, annual grasslands, and waste areas that consist of sandy to clay soils. Seedling The cotyledons (seed leaves) are hairless and dull. They are oval-shaped or oblong, 0.4 to 0.8 inch (10–20 mm) long, and 0.2 to 0.5 inch (6–12 mm) wide. The first two true leaves of Italian thistle seedlings alternate and are more tapered toward the base than the cotyledons. Young Plant Leaves of young plants alternate and form a basal rosette. The leaves taper toward the base and are broader and rounder at the tips. Leaf margins are irregularly toothed and prickly. The upper surface and lower veins of young leaves often have long, firm, sparsely distributed hairs. The veins of older leaves are pale. Mature plant Mature Italian thistle plants may grow to be up to 6.5 feet (2 meters) tall and are branched at the top. The leaves at the base of the plants are either elliptical or pointed (lance-shaped), with prickly, toothed margins (4–10 lobes per leaf). Leaves on stems are alternated and their petioles extend down the stem. Leaflike wings up to 0.2 inch (5 mm) wide protrude from the stems. These wings tend to be more sparse and are separated by larger gaps near the flower heads, but are much closer together in the lower parts of the plant. Flowers Italian thistle blooms from February through July. The flower heads are more or less cylindrical or bell-shaped, less than 1 inch (1–2 cm) in diameter and are usually clustered in groups of 2 to 5 at the tops of stems. Flowers are pink or purple and are 0.4 to 0.6 inch (10–14 mm) long. Bracts on the flower heads are spiny, linear or pointed, and less than 0.1 inch (no more than 2 mm) wide with a sandpapery texture. Dense patches of wooly hairs are present at the base of the bracts. Fruits Fruits are single-seeded (achene), elliptical, curved, and slightly flattened, cream-colored and have about 20 stripes that run lengthwise down the fruit. They may have either no bristles, or many feathery bristles that are about 0.4 to 0.8 inch (10–15 mm) long. Reproduction Reproduces via seeds, which are dispersed by wind. Seeds can persist in the soil for up to seven years. Related or similar plants Slenderflower thistle, Carduus tenuiflorus Musk thistle, Carduus nutans Spiny plumeless thistle, Carduus acanthoides",

    "description": "Indian tobacco, a California native, is a summer annual broadleaf plant. It appears throughout California, except the Modoc Plateau and Sonoran Desert, to about 5000 feet (1500 m) and typically grows in foothills and valleys, on open slopes and well-drained flood plains (washes). It can be weedy in various annual crops such as cotton, tomatoes, and melons. It gets its name from its cultivation by Native Americans for smoking tobacco. Appears throughout California on foothills and valleys, flood plains and sometimes in cultivated areas. Habitat Indian tobacco is found in open, well-drained flood plains (washes), slopes, foothills, valleys, and occasionally, annual crop fields. Seedling The cotyledons (seed leaves) are gray green, hairy, sticky, and one-half times as long as wide. They have a foul odor. Early true leaves lie flat on the ground, are egg shaped, pointed at the tip, gradually taper toward the base. Some leaves have stalks and others are stalkless. Mature plant The mature plant forms a rosette, grows erect from about 1 to 6 feet (30–182 cm) tall, with branches that rise with an upward curve or slant, and is heavily scented. Leaves alternate along the stem; lower leaves are lance- to egg shaped; roughly 1-1/2 to 10 inches (4–15 cm) long with short stalks, and covered with soft, sticky hairs (glands). Upper leaves are smaller and are nearly stalkless, unlike the upper leaves of manyflower tobacco, Nicotiana acuminate, which are stalked. Flowers remain open at night as opposed to the similar looking desert tobacco, N. obtusifolia (formerly trigonophylla), whose flowers open during the day. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October. Flowers are white, single, and disperse on short stalks along open branches. The base of each flower is a slender light green tube (corolla tube) that flares at the top into 5 white lobes (fused petals). A whorl of leaflike green sepals with lance-shaped teeth, envelop the corolla tube. Fruits The fruit is a smooth, oval-shaped capsule, approximately 3/5 to 4/5 inch (15-20 mm) long with 2 cells containing many small seeds. Each capsule holds roughly 24 seeds. Seeds Seeds are tiny reddish brown. Reproduction Indian tobacco reproduces by seed.

    "name": "Russian thistle",
    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/WEEDS/russian_thistle.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Russian thistle is a large and bushy noxious annual broadleaf plant. It occurs throughout the western states, more often in drier areas. Recent taxonomic work has demonstrated that what has been named Salsola tragus likely consists of several morphologically similar species that differ in flower size and shape. Besides S. tragus, these include S. australis, S. iberica, S. kali, S. pestifer, and S. ruthenica. Russian thistle is common throughout California, especially in the southern region to an elevation of 8900 feet (2700 m). It grows best on loose sandy soils and inhabits agricultural land, roadsides, and other disturbed places. When consumed in moderate amounts, immature plants are nutritious for livestock. However, with maturity and under particular conditions, some Salsola species accumulate levels of oxalates toxic to livestock, especially sheep. Most often toxicity occurs when sheep feed almost exclusively on these species for many weeks. Russian thistle also can create a fire hazard or hinder traffic when it breaks off from its main stem and dries up. At this stage, it is commonly called tumbleweed. It is also an alternate host for the beet leafhopper, Ciculifer tenellus, which vectors the virus that causes curly top disease in melons, tomatoes, sugar beets, and other crops. Common soil-applied (preemergence) herbicides generally provide good control of this weed, but the seeds can germinate from up to 2.5 inches deep, so control may be poor where incorporation is shallow. Habitat Fields, unmanaged places, roadsides, cultivated and other disturbed sites. Seedling Stems are slender and flexible and often have reddish purple streaks. The cotyledons (seed leaves) and first true leaves are long and thin, like pine needles. The cotyledons are 2/5 to 1-2/5 inches (10–35 mm) long. Later leaves are soft and fleshy with a weak spine at the tip. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem, but may appear opposite to one another because of the short length between stem joints. Later leaves are soft and fleshy, with small spines at the tips. Stems are thin, flexible, and often have reddish purple striations. Young plant Young plants are usually taller than wide. Their lateral branches are shorter than the main stem and point upward. Mature plant Mature plants are large and bushy with rigid, purple-streaked or green stems that typically curve upward giving the plant an overall round shape. They generally grow to about 3 feet (1 m) tall but can grow much larger usually with a similar height and width, or taller than wide. Leaves are somewhat bluish green, fleshy to leathery, hairless or covered with stiff short hairs, and 1/3 to 2 inches (8–52 mm) long and up to 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) wide. Leaf tips are sharply pointed to spine tipped. Upper stem leaves are reduced (bracts), stiff, and prickly. After they turn grayish brown, the plants break away from the roots at the soil line, becoming tumbleweeds that scatter their seeds as the plant skeletons are blown around. Flowers Flowers bloom from July through October. Flowers are produced in the junction between the leaf base and the stem (axils). Although they lack petals, they have an outer whorl of winglike sepals that are, translucent, petal-like, fan shaped and often pinkish to deep red with noticeable veins. Fruits Fruiting structures contain one seed, are somewhat round, and can grow to 3/10 of an inch (8 mm) in diameter—including the winglike sepals. Sepal wings are open and flat or folded over. Seed Seeds are compressed and round to somewhat conical, gray to brown, and have a thin, translucent seed coat, through which a dark, greenish-brown coiled embryo is visible. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Fivehook bassia, Bassia hyssopifolia Tumble mustard, Sisymbrium altissimum",

In California it is found in the southwestern region, desert regions, central-western region, Central Valley, central and southern Sierra Nevada, Tehachapi Mountains, and eastern North Coast Ranges to an elevation of 7200 feet (2200 m). It inhabits agricultural land and open, disturbed, and unmanaged sites. This plant is toxic to humans and livestock when ingested. Livestock seldom consume fresh plants because of their unpleasant scent and taste. However, livestock can consume dried foliage and large numbers of ground seed in poor quality hay or feed, causing health problems. Sacred thornapple is similar to a related annual species, jimsonweed, Datura stramonium. Habitat Open disturbed places, roadsides, pastures, livestock enclosures, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, ditch banks, and disturbed, unmanaged areas. Seedling Seedlings germinate in May or June. The cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrowly lance shaped, pointy, and often sparsely hairy with smooth, short hairs on the upper surface. Crushed leaves have an unpleasant odor. The main stalk below each cotyledon is hairy and often deep violet. The first leaf is oval with smooth edges. Later leaves have smooth, wavy, or wavy-toothed to lobed edges. Mature plant Sacred thornapple grows 2 to 3 feet (60–90 cm) tall. It is widely branched and has a fleshy taproot. Leaves are 1-1/2 to 5 inches (3.7–12.5 cm) long, elliptical, asymmetrical at the base, gray green with short, soft, gray hairs. Leaves have an unpleasant scent. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through October. They are large, 6 to 10 inches (15–25 cm) long and white or violet tinged. The petals are fused giving the flower a tubelike or funnel shape and five slender teeth extend from the fused petals. Fruits Fruit consist of hard, roughly spherical capsules that are densely covered with numerous short spines. Sacred thornapple fruit hang from a stalk and have slender spines distinguishing them from the jimsonweed fruit, which are more oval, stand erect from their stalk, and have thicker, more robust spines. Seeds Seeds are brown to tan, rounded triangular to slightly kidney shaped, flattened, and have grooved edges. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Canada thistle, a perennial broadleaf plant, is found in most of the western states except for southern Sierra Nevada, the Sonoran and Mojave deserts, and the Channel Islands. It is scattered throughout California to about 5900 feet (1800 m). Canada thistle inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed locations. According to some taxonomists, four varieties or biotypes exist that differ in growth habit, leaf characteristics, seed germination, and development. Canada thistle is a state-listed noxious weed in California and many other states. It is important to control plants before they regenerate food reserves in their roots or produce seed. Do not let this weed move to new areas and eliminate it from noncrop locations. Habitat Stream banks, forest openings, rangeland, hillsides, moist depressions, gardens, crop fields, roadsides, and other open, disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to oblong, usually from 1/5 to 1/2 of an inch (5–14 mm) long, thick, fused at the base, and smooth or slightly glandular. The midvein on their lower surface is shiny. The first leaves are alternate to one another on the stem and their edges are somewhat wavy to unevenly toothed. The leaf surface is covered with stiff hairs, but lower surfaces are often covered sparsely with soft, webby, hairs. Seedlings have poorly developed rosettes. Mature plant Canada thistle stands erect to 3-1/3 feet (1 m) tall and grows in clumps or patches. Its stems are slender and hairless or nearly hairless. Leaves are oblong to lance shaped, mostly 2 to 8 inches long (5–20 cm), prickly, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Sometimes leaf bases extend down the stem joints as prickly wings that are 1/2 of an inch (1 cm) long. Leaf edges range from nearly smooth to shallow lobed and toothed. The upper leaf surface is hairless to nearly hairless and the lower surface is sometimes sparsely woolly. Rosette leaves are either few or lacking altogether. The extensive root system consists of a network of vertical and creeping horizontal roots. Although most roots occur in the top 1-1/2 feet (45 cm) of the soil, vertical roots from 6-1/2 to almost 10 feet (2–3 m) deep are common. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through October. The flower head is cylindrical or narrowly egg to bell shaped, about 1/5 to 4/5 of an inch (0.5–2 cm) in diameter, and consists of several overlapping rows of scalelike structures (bracts) tipped with spines. Narrow, white, purple, or pink flowers (disk flowers) cluster above. Fruits Fruits are single seeded (achene), egg to football shaped, tan, about 1/12 to 1/6 of an inch (2–4 mm) long, and end in a long tuft of feathery bristles that are about 1/2 to 4/5 of an inch (12–20 mm) long. Reproduction Reproduces by seed and from cut roots. Seeds are wind dispersed and can be viable for many years.",

Stems may spread to almost 20 inches (0.5 m) along the ground but their tips tend to rise. Leaves are deeply lobed one to two times or deeply cut, but are not fully divided into leaflets (compound). They range from hairless to hairy and are about 3/5 to 3 inches (1.5–7 cm) long. Lower leaves grow on short stalks; upper leaves are stalkless and are alternate to one another along the stem. Flowers Flowers bloom from February through October. Tiny, white, four-petaled, stalked flowers cluster along the flowering stem forming a flower head that is about 2/5 to 1-3/5 inches (1–4 cm) long. The flowering stems mostly arise from where the leaf stalk meets the main stem. Fruits Fruits consist of a pod with a wrinkled surface that is about 1/16 of an inch (1.5 mm) long and up to 1/10 of an inch (2.75 mm) wide and has a short stalk. As it matures it develops two lobes. Within the Fruits are two chambers, each containing one seed. Seeds Seeds are oblong to somewhat kidney shaped and remain inside the hardened fruit at maturity. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Yellow sweetclover, a biennial and sometimes annual or short-lived perennial, occurs throughout California, except in the low deserts, to about 500 feet (1500 m). It inhabits agricultural land and open disturbed places. Two other common sweetclovers in California are Indian sweetclover, M. indica, and white sweetcover, M. alba. For management of yellow sweetclover, it is suggested to remove plants before seeds are formed. The seeds are resistant to both soil fumigation and solarization. Yellow sweetclover can be considered both a beneficial plant and a problematic weed. Wildlife feed on sweetclover leaves and seeds. Their flowers attract honeybees. Sweetclovers are sometimes cultivated for use as cover crops and as feed for livestock. However, sweetclover leaves and flower buds contain a low level toxicant called coumarin. If sweetclover hay or silage is poorly cured, it can develop mold that converts the coumarin to a more toxic compound called dicoumarin (dicumerol, dicumarin). Feeding on moldy sweetclover hay can lead to an often, fatal hemorrhaging disorder called “sweetclover poisoning”. Habitat Open fields, roadsides, agronomic crops, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are small, hairless, oblong, light green, and about 1/5 to 1/3 of an inch (5–8 mm) long. The first true leaf is somewhat egg shaped, tapers at the base, and is about 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm) long, but is not divided. Later leaves, however, are fully divided into three leaflets. The middle leaflet has its own short stalk. Mature plant Plants are erect and can grow to about 6-1/2 feet (2 m) tall with spreading branches. Stems become somewhat woody at the base, especially in the second year. Leaves are fully divided into three leaflets, like alfalfa. Leaflets are egg shaped to oblong and mostly 2/5 to 1 inch (1–2.5 cm) long. The middle leaflet has a short stalk. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through September. Small, yellow, sweetly fragrant, pealike, short-stalked flowers cluster along the end of each flowering stem and in leaf axils (where the leaf stalk meets the stem), creating slender flower heads. The flower heads are about 1-1/5 to almost 5 inches (3–12 cm) long. Fruits Fruits consist of somewhat oval-shaped pods, about 1/8 to 1/5 of an inch (3–5 mm) long, with a sharply ridged or veined surface that is light brown and hairless. Pods hang from downward bent stalks. Seeds Seeds are somewhat oval, smooth, dull yellowish green to orange-tan, and sometimes have purplish or brown spots. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are bright green and two to three times longer than they are wide. Mature plant Stems are single or branched depending on the species. They are thick and covered with coarse hair. Leaves are spade shaped and range from about 3 to 6 inches (8-15 cm) to nearly 1 foot (30 cm) across and generally have rough hairs. Flowers Flower clusters are composed of a dark center (disk flowers) surrounded by a halo of yellow to orange flowers that look like petals (ray flowers). Fruits Fruits are single-seeded (achenes) and resemble those of commercial sunflower seeds. Reproduction In some species propagation is by seed only and in other species, by seed and creeping roots.",

Found in the Sacramento Valley, San Francisco Bay region, and Sonoran Desert (Imperial Valley) up to 1000 feet (300 m), it is particularly problematic in Imperial Valley vegetable crops. The California Department of Food and Agriculture lists greater swinecress as a “B” noxious weed. Habitat Greater swinecress is found in vegetable crops, alfalfa pastures, orchards, fields, gardens, turf, roadsides, ditch banks, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are more or less linear with slightly rounded tips, hairless, and about 1/5 to 3/5 inch (5–15 mm) long. The first true leaves resemble the cotyledons but are longer, about 1/3 to 4/5 inch (8–20 mm) long. Young plant The young plant exists as a rosette until maturity when the flower stem develops. Mature plant The mature plant grows flat (prostrate) or low over the ground, usually with many branching stems. Leaves look feathery. They are about 12 inches (30 cm) long, deeply divided into lobes that that are toothed or lobed again, hairless to short haired, and alternate along the stem. Upper leaves are practically stalkless; lower leaves are stalked. Unlike lesser swinecress, which has a skunklike odor, greater swinecress does not have a strong scent.

It is the most commonly seen weedy spurge in California and is found throughout the state, except in the deserts and Great Basin, to about 700 feet (200 m). Spotted spurge inhabits agricultural lands and other disturbed areas. Spurges have a milky, sticky sap that can cause contact dermatitis in humans and animals. Some spurge species, if eaten, can cause mild to severe digestive tract irrigation, and even death on rare occasions. It is a host for fungal diseases and attracts pests that damage crops. Habitat Landscaped areas, walkways, roadsides, gardens, turf, orchards, vineyards, agronomic and vegetable crops, and plant nurseries. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to oblong with a rounded to slightly truncate tip, about 1/25 to 1/10 of an inch (1–3 mm) long, hairless, and often have a maroon tinge underneath. The first true leaves are egg shaped to roundish, slightly hairy, maroon tinged or have a maroon central spot, and have a rounded tip that may be minutely toothed. Mature plant Spotted spurge generally has prostrate stems that can grow up to about 20 inches (50 cm) in length, but stems can grow upward when competing for light with other plants. Branches alternate along the stem. New leaves are typically hairy, especially lower leaf surfaces. Leaves are oblong to egg shaped, about 1/6 to 2/3 of an inch (4–17 mm) long, often marked with a characteristic dark, reddish spot found midway down the center of the leaf vein, and sit atop short stalks. Creeping spurge, C. serpens, leaves are not marked with a characteristic spot. When broken, a milky, sticky sap oozes from the stem. Flowers Flowering takes place from May through October. Tiny, inconspicuous flowers are grouped in small flowerlike cups and are surrounded by white to pink petal-like appendages. Flower clusters are found at the stem tips and along the length of the stem, where one to two small flower clusters are produced where the stem and leaf stalk meet (leaf axil). Fruits The fruit consists of a tiny, roughly 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, evenly hairy, egg-shaped capsule with three lobes. The creeping spurge fruit capsule is similar in size but it is hairless and roundish.

    "description": "Yellow starthistle is a long-lived winter annual, and occasionally, a biennial broadleaf plant. It is highly competitive and often develops impenetrable stands, displacing desirable vegetation. In the western United States, yellow starthistle is considered one of the most serious rangeland weeds. It is found throughout most of central California and northward, typically to about 5900 feet (1800 m), but has been found at higher elevations. It is common in the Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, Sierra Nevada foothills, Cascade Range, Klamath Ranges, eastern North Coast Ranges, and the central-western region. It is less common in Southern California and uncommon in the desert regions, moist coastal regions, and east of the Sierra Nevada. Yellow starthistle inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites. Although several natural enemies of yellow starthistle have established in California, these insects have yet to provide a significant reduction in plant populations in most areas. In addition to being a serious rangeland weed, yellow starthistle is sometimes problematic in grain fields where it can contaminate grain harvest, lowering grain value and quality. The plant also contains an unidentified compound that can cause a nervous system disorder in horses. A positive quality of yellow starthistle is that bees produce flavorful, high quality honey when they forage on yellow starthistle. Habitat Grassland, cultivated fields, pastures, roadsides, and open sites on hillsides and in woodlands. Seedling Seedlings are dull green. Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oblong to spatula shaped, round at the tip, wedge shaped at the base, and are about 1/4 to 2/5 of an inch (6–9 mm) long. The first few leaves are usually lance shaped with the widest part of the leaf above the middle. Subsequent leaves form a rosette. The early rosette leaves are highly variable, often lance shaped with the widest part above the middle, and have simple to lobed edges. Later rosette leaves can grow to a length of 15 inches (38 cm) and are typically deeply lobed almost to the midvein and frequently appear ruffled. The lobes mostly taper to a point and have toothed to wavy edges. Rosette leaves that develop in low light conditions are usually larger and more erect. Generally, the upper and lower leaf surfaces are densely covered with stiff thick hairs and fine cottony hairs (visible with magnification). Mature plant Yellow starthistle is a gray-green to blue-green plant that ranges from 6 inches to 6-1/2 feet (0.15–2 m) tall. Stems are stiff, wiry and single in small plants and openly branch near the base or above in larger plants. Rosette leaves are typically deeply lobed, often appear ruffled, have toothed to wavy edges, and usually wither by bloom. Stem leaves are mostly linear to narrowly oblong, or lance shaped with the widest part above the middle. Leaf bases extend down the stems giving stems a winged appearance. Lower stem leaves are sometimes deeply lobed. All leaves are densely covered with fine, white, cottony hairs that hide most of the stiff, thick hairs and glandular dots also present on the leaves. Flowers Flowering takes place from June through December, but can be delayed by mowing and grazing. Many small and narrow, bright yellow, tubular flowers (disk flowers) cluster into a round to egg-shaped flower head. Flower heads form singly at both the stem tip and sometimes where branches meet the main stem (axils). At the base of each flower head are long stiff spines. Fruits Yellow starthistle produces two kinds of fruit. Both are hairless, mostly about 1/12 to 1/8 of an inch (2-3 mm) long, and generally barrel shaped. However, one type is glossy, gray or tan to a mottled cream color and tan, and ends in a tuft of slender, stiff, white bristles. The other type is dull dark brown, often with tan speckles, and is tuftless. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Bearded sprangletop is a widespread native summer annual grass. In California it grows in the Central Valley, Great Basin, and desert, to about 3900 feet (1200 m) and is typically associated with rice fields. It also inhabits other agricultural lands and disturbed places. It is generally more of a problem in rice fields where the water level is kept low during the early growth stages of rice. Because its seeds are smaller than rice grains, it is easily separated out during processing. It is usually associated with alkaline soils. Although this plant thrives in wet places, its seedling cannot survive under water. Habitat Marshes, wetlands, summer irrigated crops, irrigation and drainage ditches, orchards, vineyards, moist pastures, landscaped sites, and roadsides. Seedling Leaves on seedlings are light green usually with a white midrib. Mature plant Bearded sprangletop grows upright to spreading in loose clumps. It grows to about 3-1/3 feet (1 m) in height or length and has well spaced flowering branches. Stems are round to slightly flattened in cross-section and have rough sheaths and leaf blades. Lower sheaths may be straw colored to reddish. Leaves are flat to loosely rolled, 4 to 20 inches (10–50 cm) long, hairless, and have a whitish midvein. Leaves are rolled in the bud. Collar region Ligules are long, membranous, with a jagged tip, and tear easily. There are no auricles. Flowers Flowering takes place from May through November. The upright to horizontal open-branching flower stalks, have small spikelike flower clusters that change from gray-green when young to straw colored at maturity. Bearded sprangletop can be distinguished from other sprangletops that grow in California by the short needlelike awns on the tip of each flower. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Creeping spurge is a summer annual broadleaf plant. In California it is found in the Central Valley, southern South Coast Ranges, and southwestern region, to about 700 feet (200 m) and inhabits agricultural lands and other disturbed places. Spurge species have a milky, sticky sap that can cause contact dermatitis in humans and animals. If consumed, some spurge species can cause mild to severe digestive tract irrigation, and even death on rare occasions. It is a host for fungal diseases and attracts pests that damage crops. Creeping spurge can behave as a weak perennial, overwintering in milder climates of California. It is becoming more problematic in nursery production and landscapes. Habitat Yards, landscaped areas, walkways, roadsides, gardens, turf, orchards, vineyards, crop fields, nursery grounds and containers. Seedling Leaves are opposite one another along the stem. Mature plant Creeping spurge typically has prostrate stems that can reach 20 inches (50 cm) in length, with alternating branches. Stems often root at stem joints (nodes). Leaves are egg shaped to slightly oblong, hairless, small—roughly 1/12 to 1/3 of an inch (2–7 mm) long, and light green. It has no distinct leaf markings as found on spotted spurge leaves, C. maculata, which have a characteristic red spot. Leaves have short stalks and are opposite to one another along the stem. Flowers Tiny flowers are grouped in small flowerlike cups with white, petal-like appendages surrounding the actual flowers. Flower clusters are found at the stem tips and along the length of the stem. Where the stem and leaf stalks meet (leaf axil), one to two small flower clusters are produced. Fruits The seedpod or capsule is almost round, roughly 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, hairless, and has three lobes. Each capsule has three chambers, each with one seed. Spotted spurge capsules are similar in size, but egg shaped and evenly hairy.

It is abundant in California to about 4900 feet (1500 m) and is commonly found in California's Central Valley and coastal areas where it grows year-round. Annual sowthistle inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed locations. It can harbor pests that are economically important to vegetable and fruit crops. Such pests include lettuce aphid, Nasanovia ribis-nigri, lettuce root aphid, Pemphigus busarius, green peach aphid, Myzus persicae, and nematodes. All are potential vectors of plant viruses. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, pastures, riparian areas, yards, gardens, roadsides, and disturbed sites. Seedling Species are not easy to distinguish at the seedling stage. Cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped to narrowly football shaped, hairless, short stalked and about 1/6 to 1/3 of an inch (4–8 mm) long. The first leaf is egg shaped, sparsely hairy, and the leaf edge is lined with backward pointing teeth. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Mature plant Plants are coarse, erect, and can reach about 4-3/5 feet (1.4 m) in height. The stem is smooth, thick, hollow between stem joints (nodes), and secretes a milky sap when cut. The leaves are hairless somewhat bluish green. The upper leaves are smaller than the lower leaves, stalkless, and clasp the stems with clawlike basal lobes. Lower leaves are usually about 4 to 8 inches (10–20 cm) long, with a tapered or winged base, and are deeply lobed. The terminal leaf lobes are much larger than the lateral lobes. Flowers Flowering generally takes place in the spring and summer and under favorable conditions, year-round. Flowers cluster at the stem tips to form daisylike flower heads. When closed the flower heads are urn shaped. Flower heads mature into white, fluffy seed heads, although not ball-shaped like in dandelions.

    "description": "Red sorrel is a perennial broadleaf plant found throughout California, except in deserts up to about 9800 feet (3000 m). It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Its leaves contain varying levels of compounds called oxalates, which are toxic under certain conditions if ingested in quantity. Because its leaves are sour tasting, livestock generally avoid consuming red sorrel. However, if more palatable forage is unavailable, they may eat it and risk ingesting toxic levels of these compounds. Habitat Pastures, grassland, crop fields, orchards, vineyards, roadsides, landscaped areas, nursery crops, gardens, coastal dunes, open disturbed sites in forests and forest plantations and riparian areas. Seedling Young cotyledons (seed leaves) are oblong, fused at the base, hairless, dull, and about 1/5 to 2/5 of an inch (5–10 mm) in length. Leaves are stalked, are alternate to one another along the stem, and can change shape over time. The first and next few leaves are egg shaped. Later leaves are arrowhead shaped with basal lobes that spread outward. Mature plant One or a few slender stems grow erect from the crown reaching up to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) in height. Leaves are hairless and are alternate to one another along the stem, mostly near the base of the plant. Lower leaves are from 4/5 to 4 inches (2–10 cm) long, have stalks that are sometimes longer than the leaves, and develop basal lobes, giving them an arrowhead-shaped appearance. Upper leaves are sometimes linear or lance shaped, and stalked. A characteristic membranous sheath encircles the stem at the base of the leaf. Red sorrel is distinguished from curly dock by its creeping roots, arrowhead-shaped leaves, and the lack of teeth or projections on flower parts that remain attached to the fruit. Flowers Flowering takes place from March through November. Small flowers cluster along a branching flower stalk. Initially they are yellowish green, but eventually turn reddish. Fruits Reddish brown, granular textured flower parts adhere to the tiny fruit, enclosing it. The fruits are tiny—up to 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, egg shaped, three sided, glossy, and contain a single seed. Reproduction Reproduces from creeping roots and by seed.

    "description": "Pale smartweed is a summer annual broadleaf plant that typically inhabits areas in or around water. It is found throughout California to about 4900 feet (1500 m) and grows in or on the edges of marshes, lakes, ponds, and streams. Their leaves provide protection for wildlife and their seeds are an important source of food for many waterfowl, songbirds, and mammals. Although considered desirable members of natural areas, pale smartweed can invade agricultural land and other disturbed areas. In fact, stands of pale smartweed can reduce the flow of water in irrigation ditches, canals, and drainage areas. Habitat Margins of water bodies, pastures, orchards, irrigated crop fields, and rice fields. Seedling Cotyledons are narrowly football shaped to oblong, have a mostly hairless surface sparsely covered with minute, flat, glandular dots, are 1/10 to 1/2 an inch (3–12 mm) long, and have short stalks that are fused at the base. The first and later leaves are football shaped and are alternate to one another along the stem. Mature plant Plants may be erect or creeping with weak, ascending stems, and reach 5 feet (1.5 m) in length. Stems are coarse, often reddish, swollen at the nodes (joints), and typically root at the lower nodes. Leaves are long, narrow, and taper at the tip. They have whitish undersides, range from roughly 1 to 8 inches (2.5–20 cm), and are alternate to one another along the stem. The lower leaf surface is dotted with tiny sunken glands and generally covered with short hairs. The upper leaf surface is mostly smooth, except for minute stiff hairs found over the veins. Flowers Flowering takes place from June through October. Small whitish green to pale pink flowers cluster densely along the flowering stem forming cylindrical-shaped spikes that are about 1-1/5 to 3 inches (3–8 cm) long and droop from the stalk. Individual flowers never open. Flowers of the closely related ladysthumb, P. persicaria, open, are brighter pink, and cluster on a shorter, more erect flowering spike. Fruits Fruits are tiny, egg shaped, less than 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) long, brown to black, glossy, and contain a single seed. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Smutgrass is a tufted warm-season perennial grass that often invades irrigated pastures and turf areas particularly those with heavy grazing, foot traffic, or poor drainage. Sometime a black fungus called “smut” infects the flower clusters and upper leaves, hence the name smutgrass. This grass is found in the Sacramento Valley, northern San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco Bay region, Central Coast, South Coast, southern Peninsular Ranges, and elsewhere to about 3900 feet (1200 m). It is most problematic in southern part of the state. Habitat Smutgrass inhabits pastures (especially irrigated), ditches, turf, roadsides, crop fields, and other disturbed open places. Collar Ligules are a fringe of minute hairs. There are no auricles. Mature plant The mature plant grows in tufts up to 3-1/3 feet (1 m) long. Stems are round in cross-section, very tough and wiry, branched, fibrous at the base, and grow in a spreading to erect manner. Leaves are flat, rolled in the bud, have conspicuous veins, are hairless except for a few tiny hairs around the collar, and grow from 3-1/5 to 12 inches (8–30 cm) long and 1/8 to 1/5 inch (3–5 mm) wide. Sheaths are open and have intact or frayed, brown bases. Flowers Flowers bloom mostly from July through October, but will bloom as early as April where mild winters occur. Single flowers form clusters called inflorescences in dense spikelike or racemelike branches (panicles) that range from 4 to 20 inches (10–50 cm), but can grow to 31 inches (80 cm). They are often gray-green or purplish. Seeds The brown seeds are approximately 1/25 inch (1 mm) long. They become sticky when moistened. Seeds disperse from the parent plant with water, mud, or clinging to animals, shoes, tires, tools, and agricultural equipment. Reproduction Smutgrass reproduces by seed and usually produces many seeds. Related or similar plants Poverty dropseed, Sporobolus vaginiflorus",

    "description": "Shepherd's-purse is a winter annual broadleaf weed, but may grow all year in cool coastal areas of California. It is common throughout California to about 7600 feet (2300 m). It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Its fruit has a peppery flavor and is sometimes added as a spice to salad greens. However, shepherd’s-purse seeds and leaves contain compounds called glucosinolates, which cause digestive irritation when consumed in quantity. Habitat Agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, nurseries, gardens, turf, landscaped areas, roadsides, and other disturbed places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrowly football shaped with a rounded tip, pale green, about 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm) long, with tiny granules on the surface. The first and next few leaves are narrowly football shaped to egg shaped, with rounded tips, and smooth to toothed edges. Later leaves are typically toothed to deeply lobed. True leaves are covered with star-shaped hairs that distinguish shepherd's-purse from most other weed seedlings. Young plant Until the flower stem develops at maturity, plants exist as flat basal rosettes. Mature plant Plants grow to about 20 inches (50 cm) tall. Leaves vary in shape and are lightly covered with both simple and forked hairs. Rosette leaves are about 1-1/5 to 4 inches (3–10 cm) long and their edges range from nearly smooth to deeply lobed. Flower stems are single or branched. Stem leaves are sparse, reduced in size, and stalkless. Leaves have toothed or lobed edges, lobed bases clasping the stem, and are alternate to one another. Flowers Flowering takes place mostly in late winter or spring, but can take place year-round under favorable conditions. Flower stalks grow erect or slightly horizontal and are mostly 2/5 to 3/5 of an inch (10–15 mm) long. The four white flower petals are sometimes tinged pale pink, and narrow toward the base (clawed). Fruits Fruits consist of flat, heart or triangular-shaped pods making this species easy to recognize when mature and distinguishes it from other plants in the mustard family. Each pod has two chambers divided by a narrow ridge (septum). The pods attach to the stem on long stalks. They are peppery in taste, and eventually open to release many seeds from each chamber. Seeds Seeds are oblong, slightly flattened, a dull, reddish to yellowish brown, and tiny—about 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) long. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "name": "Shattercane",
    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/WEEDS/shattercane.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Shattercane is a summer annual grass descended from wild and cultivated sorghum varieties; it is commonly called “sorghum” in some circles. In California it is found in the deserts, Central Valley, North Coast Ranges, and coastal regions, to almost 2000 feet (600 m). Like its close relative, johnsongrass, shattercane has many regional biotypes, grows rapidly, and competes aggressively with crop plants significantly reducing yield. Shattercane readily hybridizes with johnsongrass and both species freely cross with commercial sorghum cultivars, reducing the quality and value of harvested seed. Fungi, bacteria, and nematodes can infect weedy sorghums and then cause agricultural problems. Weedy sorghum serves as an alternate host to pests such as sorghum midge, Contarinia sorghicola, and viruses causing sugarcane mosaic, maize chlorotic dwarf, and corn stunt. Shattercane and johnsongrass can provide wholesome forage for livestock, however, once exposed to frost, drought, trampling, or herbicides, leaves of both species can manufacture levels of hydrocyanic acid that can be poisonous to livestock when ingested. Under some conditions, plants accumulate toxic levels of nitrates. At maturity some plants “shatter”, or shed many flowers (spikelets), hence its common name. Habitat Shattercane is found in fields, agronomic and vegetable crops, disturbed sites, roadsides and especially grows on fallow fields. It grows best in warm temperate to subtropical areas on well-drained, fertile soil where warm-season moisture exists, but can tolerate hot, dry conditions. Seedling Shattercane resembles a corn or johnsongrass seedlings and it is indistinguishable from commercial sorghum until the flowering stage. Careful removal of the seedling and examination of the attached seed will confirm whether or not it is corn. Shattercane and johnsongrass seeds are similar: football- to egg-shaped and dark reddish-brown to black. However, seeds of johnsongrass are narrower, mostly 1/16 to 1/12 inch (1.5–2 mm) wide, whereas those of shattercane are wider, mostly 1/10 to 1/6 inch (2.5–4 mm). Shattercane leaves are rolled in the bud. If the first blade is parallel to the ground the seedling is more likely johnsongrass and not shattercane. Mature plant Shattercane resembles grain sorghum and corn. It is a coarse grass that usually grows in tufts and reaches almost 7 feet (2m) tall. Stems are erect, round to slightly compressed in cross-section, unbranched, with solid internodes, and sometimes, purplish spots. Leaves are bright green with a noticeable white midvein. They grow to 3-1/3 feet (100 cm) long, 1-1/5 to 4 inch (3–10 cm) wide, and are hairless to slightly hairy, particularly near the ligule. Leaf edges are rough. Sheaths are open, pale green to reddish, ribbed, hairless or slightly hairy at the collar. Tillers grow from the crown. Johnsongrass leaves are overall shorter, up to 2 feet (60 cm) long and 1/5 to 1-1/5 inch (0.5–3 cm) wide. Robust, coarse rhizomes are found at the base of johnsongrass plants, but not in shattercane. Collar The collar is wide, smooth, and pale green or whitish. Auricles are absent. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October. Generally the flower clusters (inflorescences) form dense, compact, and stiffly upright flowering branches (panicles). Occasionally the branches are open, and the inflorescence has more of a pyramid shape and droops at the top. Initially the inflorescences are pale green or violet green that frequently mature into dark reddish or purplish brown. Mature johnsongrass flowering branches are characteristically open and pyramid shaped. Shattercane panicles range from 3-1/5 to 20 inches (8–50 cm) long. Seeds Shattercane plants can yield up to 2000 seeds per panicle generally producing more seeds than johnsongrass. Reproduction Shattercane reproduces by seed.

In California, it is found in the Central Valley and southwestern regions, to about 1600 feet (550 m). This sedge inhabits pond margins, ditches, and is particularly common in rice-growing areas. It typically grows in wet soil or shallow water, does not tolerate deep water, and grows best on fertile soil. This plant produces thousands of small seeds that become uniformly distributed over the ground. Some biotypes have developed tolerance to certain herbicides. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are more or less football shaped, hairless, translucent, and very tiny, less than 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) long. The first leaf blade is bright green, with three veins, and roughly 1/6 to 1/3 of an inch (4–8 mm) long. At the three-leaf stage, narrow, grasslike leaves grow out in three directions at approximately 120° angles from one another. Seedling roots are sometimes pinkish. Mature plant Mature plants grow in clumps, reach about 12 to 16 inches (30–40 cm) tall, and produce round clusters of greenish brown to purplish spikelets at maturity. Several pithy stems, sharply triangular in cross-section and often with concave sides, rise from the base of the plant. Sheaths are closed. There are typically two to four basal leaves per stem that are slightly rough to the touch on the margins near the tips. Each stem has secondary leaves below the flower clusters. Roots are fibrous and sometimes reddish. Flowers Flowering takes place from May through November. Flowers are greenish brown to purplish and cluster densely to form round, stalked or stalkless flower heads, each having two to three modified leaves below it. Fruits The fruits are egg shaped, pale greenish brown, glossy, and very tiny—less than 1/25 of an inch (1 mm). Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

It is found throughout California, except the Great Basin and deserts, to about 5600 feet (1700 m). The taproot and other plant parts are edible. Animals feed on its leaves and fruit. Habitat Disturbed sites, fields, orchards, vineyards, perennial crop fields, roadsides, vacant urban lots, trail sides in woodlands and grass lands, open areas in coniferous forests, and other unmanaged, disturbed places. Seedling Seedlings are narrow and grasslike and grow out of a tube formed by the bases of the cotyledons (seed leaves). The cotyledons are linear, about 4-1/3 to 5 inches (11–13 cm) long, stalkless, hairless, and more or less fused at the base. First and later true leaves of the seedling are usually about 3-1/2 to almost 5 inches (9–12 cm) long, and resemble the cotyledons. Young plant Plants remain in the rosette form until the flower stem develops at maturity. At this stage they are grasslike. Mature plant Plants grow erect, range from 2 to 4 feet (60–120 cm) tall, and have few stem branches. Rosette and stem leaves are grasslike with parallel veins, slightly fleshy, release a milky sap when torn, and range from about 5 to 20 inches (15–50 cm) long. The leaf base is broad and clasps the stem. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Taproots are thick, fleshy, usually branched, and also contain a milky sap. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through July. A thick stalk bears a single flower head at its tip. The flower head contains purple flowers that cluster, daisylike, and is surrounded by 8 or 9 narrow and green modified leaves (bracts) that are much longer than the petals. A related weed, western salsify, has yellow flowers. Flower heads are generally open and track the sun from morning to midday. Fruits Mature fruiting heads look like those of dandelion puffballs. The tiny, oblong to narrowly football-shaped fruit is about 1 to 1-3/5 inches (2.5–4 cm) long, and has a thin projection that ends in a tuft of soft white hairs. Each fruit contains one seed.

In California, it is found in the southern Sacramento Valley, San Joaquin Valley, southwestern regions, Mojave Desert and Modoc Plateau to about 3000 feet (900 m). Longspine sandbur favors sandy or well-drained soil. Longspine sandbur grows on agricultural land and in other disturbed areas. It is difficult to distinguish from southern sandbur and field sandbur. All of these species are aggressive and can invade and colonize an open, disturbed site. Immature sandburs provide good forage for livestock. However, when they mature they develop fruit with stiff spines that can injure the mouths of animals and the hands and feet of people. Habitat Open disturbed sites in fields, orchards, vineyards, croplands (especially alfalfa), ditch banks, roadsides, and other unmanaged, disturbed areas. Seedling Seedlings closely resemble those of barnyardgrass. The cotyledon (seed leaf) is flattened and has a purplish tinge at the bottom. The most distinctive characteristic for seedling identification is a spiny bur (see “Mature plant” section), from which the young plant emerged. It may be found by digging carefully around the roots. Mature plant Plants often form large mats and can grow to 2 feet (0.6 m) in length. Branched stems grow erect or spread, are flattened in cross-section, often bend abruptly toward the base, and have loose spikes of spiny burs at maturity. Each bur contains one to three seeds. A seed germinates from within a bur. Therefore, the bur a seedling grew from can be found around the root system of the young plant. Sheaths are open, usually hairless, and their margins are membranous and sometimes lined with a few hairs. Leaves are flat, sometimes folded, with a hairless upper surface, and fold in the bud. Collar region The collar is narrow and lighter in color than the rest of the sheath and on occasion has sparse, long hairs on its margin. The ligule consists of a fringe of hairs. Flowers Flowering takes place from July through September. The main flower stalk axis is wavy and contains yellowish green, spiny burs. Burs consist of flower clusters enclosed in spiny modified leaves (bracts). Up to 50 burs may occur on a spike but generally there are 40 or fewer. The spike is partially enclosed by a leaf sheath. Burs turn light brown when they mature. Burs disperse in many ways such as by clinging to animals, shoes, clothing, tires, machinery, and floating on water. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "The most common weedy ryegrasses in California are Italian ryegrass, Lolium multiflorum, also called annual ryegrass, and perennial ryegrass, L. perenne. Italian ryegrass is a winter annual or biennial grass that sometimes behaves as a short-lived perennial. Perennial ryegrass, on the other hand, is a short-lived perennial that behaves like an annual or biennial under poor conditions. Both grasses are found throughout California to about 3300 feet (1000 m), except in deserts and the Great Basin. Ryegrasses inhabit agricultural land and other disturbed areas. They can hybridize with one another, resulting in offspring that are difficult to identify as either species. Ryegrasses are cultivated for turf and forage. Sometimes Italian ryegrass is grown as a cover crop. Ryegrasses in the North Coast and other regions occasionally become infected with a fungus that causes an illness called “ryegrass staggers” in livestock. Habitat Roadsides, open fields, crop fields, pastures, orchards, and vineyards. Seedling Seedling leaves are shiny. Mature plant Both Italian and Perennial ryegrasses grow erect to about 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. Stems grow singly or in clumps and are rounded to slightly flattened in cross-section. Leaf blades are flat, glossy, generally hairless, and range from 2-2/5 to 10 inches (6–25 cm) long. One distinguishing characteristic between the two is that Italian ryegrass leaves are rolled in the bud whereas perennial ryegrass leaves are usually folded in the bud (but also can be rolled). Another difference is that the leaves of Italian ryegrass range from 1/10 to 2/5 of an inch (3–10 mm) wide and those of perennial ryegrass range from 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm) wide. Collar region Ligules are membranous and up to 1/10 of an inch (3 mm) in length. Auricles are usually well developed, up to 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) long, or are sometimes lacking. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through September. The flowerhead is 3 to 12 inches (8–30 cm) long. It consists of small, spikelets that are spaced apart along the main flowering stem and are alternate to one another. Occasionally spikelets branch off the main axis. Italian ryegrass has longer needlike awns on the individual flowers and more flowers are clustered per spikelet than in perennial ryegrass. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "London rocket is a highly competitive winter annual broadleaf plant. In California it is found in primarily in the lower two thirds of the state but has also been reported in upper central valley to about 2600 feet (800 m). Habitat Roadsides, fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval, about 1/13 to 1/4 of an inch (2–6 mm) long, hairless, and on stalks that are equal in length to the blade. The first leaf is oval, a bit larger than the cotyledon, has smooth edges or a few weak teeth, and is on a long stalk. The next few leaves resemble the first, but have shallow-toothed edges. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Young plant Plants exist as rosettes until they develop flowering stems at maturity. Mature plant Stems are erect, mostly branch near the base, and usually grow to about 2 feet (60 cm) tall. Leaves are nearly hairless. Rosette leaves vary from deeply lobed to being separated fully into leaflets (compound) in the lower part. Lower leaves can grow to about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Upper leaves are somewhat oblong, mostly with two basal lobes angled away from the base, stalkless, smaller than the lower leaves, and do not clasp the stem. Sisymbrium mustards like London rocket and tumble mustard have simple hairs, rather than the branched hairs of flixweed. Flixweed has very finely divided leaves whose leaflets are also finely divided once or twice again. However, most Sisymbrium species have undivided, lobed leaves or leaves divided into leaflets that may be lobed, but are not divided again. Flowers Flowering takes place from January to May. Flowers are pale yellow, rarely white, narrowed at the base, and roughly 1/10 to 1/6 inch (3–4 mm) long. Small clusters of flowers grow at the stem tip. Fruits Fruits consist of long, thin, tubular seed pods, that are flexible, straight or slightly curved, roughly 1 to 1-1/2 inches (3-4 cm) long, and about 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) wide. Seeds Seeds are oblong and less than 1/25 inch (1 mm) long. Reproduction London rocket reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Flixweed Tumble mustard",

    "description": "Italian ryegrass, also called annual ryegrass, is an upright annual grass that behaves like a biennial or short-lived perennial. It grows vigorously in winter and early spring. Italian ryegrass and a related species, perennial ryegrass, Lolium perenne, are the two most common weedy ryegrasses in California. It is found throughout California to about 3300 feet (1000 m), except in deserts and the Great Basin and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed places. Italian ryegrass and perennial ryegrass can hybridize, resulting in offspring that are difficult to identify as either species. Ryegrasses are cultivated for turf and forage. Sometimes Italian ryegrass is grown as a cover crop. Ryegrasses in the North Coast and other regions occasionally become infected with a fungus that causes an illness called “ryegrass staggers” in livestock. Habitat Roadsides, open fields, crop fields, pastures, orchards, and vineyards. Seedling Seedling leaves are shiny. Mature plant Italian ryegrass grows erect to about 3 feet (0.9 m) tall. Stems grow singly or in clumps and are rounded to slightly flattened in cross-section. Leaf blades are flat, glossy, generally hairless, and range from 2-2/5 to 10 inches (6–25 cm) long. One characteristic distinguishing it from perennial ryegrass is that its leaves are rolled in the bud. Perennial ryegrass leaves are usually folded in the bud, but also can be rolled. Also leaf width can differ. Italian ryegrass leaves range from 1/10 to 2/5 of an inch (3–10 mm) wide; perennial ryegrass leaves range from 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm). Collar region Ligules are membranous and can grow to 1/10 of an inch (3 mm) in length. Auricles are usually well developed, up to 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) long, or are sometimes lacking. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through September. The flowerhead is 3 to 12 inches (8–30 cm) long. It consists of small, stalkless spikelets that are alternate to one another along the main flowering stem. Occasionally they branch off the main axis. Italian ryegrass has long needlike awns on the individual flowers (florets), and more florets are clustered per spikelet than in perennial ryegrass. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

Although a desirable component of vegetation in natural areas, redmaids are a minor weed, especially in cool-season, noncompetitive crop fields like baby spinach. It is found throughout California, except in deserts, the eastern Modoc Plateau, and east of the central Sierra Nevada to about 7200 feet (2200 m) and is abundant in the Sacramento and northern San Joaquin valleys. Redmaids prefer cool, damp conditions and dries up with the onset of hot spring weather. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, grassland, open areas in foothill woodland, and open disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are long, narrow, slightly succulent, generally broadest at the tip, hairless or nearly so, and bright green. First true leaves are broader and larger than the cotyledons, fleshy, and lack definite stalks, distinguishing them from the seedlings of miner's lettuce. Leaves are linear to narrowly egg shaped, larger than the cotyledons, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Mature plant Plants can grow up to about 1 foot (30 cm) tall. Stems branch at the base and usually grow in a, prostrate form, often spreading over other vegetation. Leaves are variable, ranging from linear to narrowly egg shaped, with pointed or rounded tips, hairless or nearly so, and light or bright green. They are slightly succulent, stalkless, and about 2/5 to 4 inches (1–10 cm) long and are alternate to one another along the stem. Flowers Flowering takes place from February through May or June. Flowers usually have five, bright, reddish-pink petals about 1-1/2 to 6 inches (4–15 cm) long with notched tips, and a white center. Fruits Fruits consist of egg-shaped capsules, roughly 1/6 to over 1/4 of an inch (4–7 mm) long that open into three sections. Each capsule contains numerous seeds.

    "description": "Wild radish is a winter or summer annual, or sometimes a biennial broadleaf. In California both wild radish and radish, Raphanus sativus, are widespread and where they occur together they readily hybridize. The resulting offspring pose a problem for identification to species because of the range of characteristics they exhibit. Wild radish is found throughout California except for deserts, up to 2600 feet (800 m) and radish is found throughout except for deserts, the Great Basin, and some mountain areas, to 3300 feet (1000 m). Both are susceptible to several diseases and pests that damage a variety of crops. These pests include flea beetle, thrips, blackleg of brassicas, and turnip yellow mosaic tymovirus (TYMV). They also attract several beneficial predators of crop pests, as well as bees. Wild radish can be found in agricultural fields and other disturbed sites. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, neglected gardens, parks, roadsides, and other disturbed locations. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are kidney to broadly heart shaped, about 2/5 to 4/5 inch (1–2 cm) long, with a deep notch at the tip and a base that abruptly tapers to a hairless stalk. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The seedlings resemble mustards in the genus Brassica but are duller green and more roughly textured. Both the first true leaves and a few later leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and attach to the stem on long stalks. Both the first true leaves and later few leaves have a long football shape, a base that tapers or is deeply lobed once or twice, irregularly round-toothed edges, and are attached to the stem with long stalks. Young plant Plants exist as rosettes until the flower stem develops at maturity. Mature plant Mature plants are erect, up to 2 feet (1.2 m) tall, and usually branch in the upper portion. Leaves vary in size and shape, but are usually sparsely covered with stiff, flattened hairs, especially toward the base. Lower leaves range from football to egg shaped, deeply lobed (but sometimes weakly lobed) to deeply divided into leaflets, have irregularly round edges or sharp toothed edges, and are typically 2-1/3 to 8 inches (6–20 cm) long. Upper leaves are reduced in size, football shaped, toothed, sometimes lobed at the base, and either stalkless or on a short stalk. Flowers Flowers have four petals that are narrowed at the base, are generally 3/5 to 1 inch (15-25 mm) long, and may have dark violet veins. Wild radish flowering takes place from April through July. Flower petals range from white to a faded yellow, or pale purplish pink. Radish flowering takes place from February through July. Flower petals are usually pale purplish-pink and occasionally, white. Hybridized populations usually exhibit many flower colors, from white to purple to pink or light yellow brown with streaks of different colors. Fruits Seedpods are initially fleshy and with time become dry and corky. They are long and narrow, almost straight, roundish in cross-section, with a pointed tip. The pods do not open to release seed. Wild radish: Seedpods are mostly 1-3/5 to 3-1/6 inches (4–8 cm) long and 1/6 to 1/4 of an inch (4–6 mm) wide, with a nearly uniform diameter for most of the length, and a beak about 2/5 to 4/5 of an inch (1–2 cm) long. Dry pods are noticeably constricted between seeds. Radish: Dried seedpods have straight sides or may have slight constrictions between seeds. The diameter is largest below the middle and tapers toward the end of the pod. Seeds Seed are round to egg shaped, from less than 1/10 of an inch up to 1/6 of an inch (2–4 mm) long and roughly 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) wide. They are brown, reddish brown, or yellowish brown.

Listed as a “C-rated*” noxious weed in California, puncturevine produces many burs with sharp spines that can injure humans and animals, as well puncture bicycle tires. In addition, leaves contain compounds called saponins, which can be toxic to livestock (especially sheep) when eaten in quantity. It is prevalent in areas with hot summers, and is found throughout California to about 3300 feet (1000 m). It inhabits agricultural land, especially cotton fields and other disturbed sites. The stem weevil, Microlarinus lypriformis, and the seed weevil, M. lareynii, are two introduced biological control agents that can keep puncturevine populations in check, but the suppression is cyclic and not always effective. Habitat Vineyards, orchards, crop fields, roadsides, railways, walkways, and other disturbed areas. Often found in areas with high soil compaction. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are green above and grayish underneath. The thick, oblong cotyledons are brittle, have a slightly indented tip, and are creased along the prominent midvein. They are 1/6 to 3/5 of an inch (4–15 mm) long. The first and later leaves resemble those of the mature plant. Mature plant Plants grow prostrate over open ground, but when shaded or competing with other plants they can grow nearly erect. Stems occasionally grow over 3 feet (1 m) long, have many branches, are green to reddish brown, and spread radially from the crown. Stems and leaves are covered with hairs. Leaves are mostly 2/17 to 1/5 of an inch (3–5 cm) long, finely divided into three to seven pairs of leaflets, and opposite to one another along the stem. Flowers Flowering takes place from March through October. Flowers are bright yellow, about 1/5 to 3/5 of an inch (5–15 mm) in diameter, and are produced singly where the stem and leaf stalk meet. They open only on sunny mornings, except in shady areas. Fruits The fruit, a woody five-lobed bur, is gray to yellowish tan, hairy, and roughly 1/5 to 2/5 of an inch (5–10 mm) in diameter. Fruits separate at maturity into five (sometimes four) wedge-shaped nutlets, each with two stout spines and several short prickles. Each nutlet usually encloses three to five seeds Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Puncturvine is unlikely to be confused with other plants.",

It is found throughout California, except deserts, up to 5900 feet (about 1800 m), but is primarily found in northern and coastal regions. Quackgrass inhabits moist meadows and disturbed sites. Found abundantly in mountain meadows, it thrives on different soil types, in gravel and peat, and also under saline and alkaline conditions. It is a highly competitive agricultural weed and can significantly reduce crop yields and contaminate seed grain crops. Cultivation and herbicide applications may need to be repeated to eliminate quackgrass problems. Avoid spreading or reintroducing quackgrass on contaminated equipment or in irrigation water. Habitat Moist meadows, cultivated fields, urban landscapes, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Leaf characteristics are similar to those of mature plants, except that blades are usually narrower and auricles may not be developed. By the six- to eight-leaf stage, underground, horizontal stems (rhizomes) develop. Young plant Plants that sprout from belowground horizontal stem (rhizome) buds form their own rhizomes at the three-to-four-leaf stage. Mature plant Quackgrass is erect, can form clumps, and grows to almost 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. Stems are round in cross-section and stem joints (nodes) appear swollen. Leaves are rolled in the bud. Leaves are flat, about 1-3/5 to 12 inches (4–30 cm) long and 4/5 to 5-1/2 inches (2–14 mm) wide, droop, and are often constricted at the tip. The lower leaf surface has a waxy coating, and the upper leaf surface has either a hairy or waxy coating. The sheath is open, hairless or covered with short, soft hairs. The ligule is membraneous with a fine fringe. Auricles are narrow, clasp the stem, and tinged whitish to violet. Collar region The sheath is open, hairless or covered with short, soft hairs and the ligule is membraneous with a fine fringe. Auricles are narrow, clasp the stem, and tinged whitish to violet. Flowers Flowering takes place from May through September. The flower head is a spike about 2 to 8 inches (5–20 cm) long. The spikelets are flattened, stalkless, and alternate to one another along the spike. Seeds Seeds are formed in flattened spikelets along the seed head. Reproduction Reproduces by seeds and underground, horizontal creeping stems (rhizomes). Rhizomes have been observed penetrating hard soils and growing into potato tubers. Rhizomes are easily spread during cultivation or harvesting and fragments on equipment will also spread this weed to other fields. They occur mostly in the upper 6 inches (15 cm) of soil and may reach depths of 8 inches (20 cm), spreading laterally 3 to 5 feet (0.9–1.5 m).",

It is found throughout California to about 4600 feet (1400 m) and is common in agricultural areas and other disturbed places. Although it thrives under dry conditions, common purslane competes well under irrigated conditions. Plants prefer loose, nutrient-rich, sandy soil. Many regional biotypes are recognized as varieties or subspecies. Common purslane's distinctive succulent foliage is unlikely to be confused with other weed species. The purslane sawfly, Schizocerella pilicornis, and a leafminer weevil, Hypurus bertrandiperris, are two accidentally introduced biological control agents that have become widespread in California. Where the purselane sawfly has been established, the California Department of Food and Agriculture has rated it as providing excellent control of common purslane populations. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, crop fields, landscaped areas, gardens, roadsides and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped to oblong, hairless, succulent, about 1/13 to 1/5 of an inch (2–5 mm) long, and sometimes tinged red. Leaves are stalkless, or nearly so, and are opposite to one another along the stem. Mature plant The mature plant grows prostrate to spreading, up to 3-1/3 ft (1 m) in length, and has many succulent branches, starting from the base. Leaves are egg to spatula shaped, succulent, stalkless or have very short stalks, about 1/5 inches to 1-1/5 inches (5–30 mm) long, and sometimes their edges are red-tinged. Leaves are arranged either opposite one another or alternate along the stem. Flowers Flowering takes place from May through September. Single flowers or clusters of two to five, are found at stem tips. The flowers are small, yellow, usually have five petals, and typically open only on hot, sunny days from midmorning to early afternoon. Fruits Fruits consist of almost round to egg-shaped capsules, usually about 1/6 to 1/3 of an inch (4–8 mm) long that open around the middle to release many seeds. Seeds Seeds are tiny, less than 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) in diameter, circular to egg shaped, flattened, and brown to black with a white point of attachment. Numerous seeds are produced.

    "description": "Pacific poison-oak is a native perennial broadleaf vine or shrub that is sometimes treelike in form. Poison-oak is found throughout California, except the Great Basin and southwestern edge of the Mojave Desert, up to 5400 feet (1650 m). It inhabits oak woodlands, chaparral, conifer and mixed conifer forests. It is particularly troublesome in the dry sandy soils of the foothills and dry-farmed mountain orchards. Poison-oak is considered one of the most hazardous plants in the western United States. Its milky, poisonous oil, containing a compound called urushiol, can cause a severe skin rash. Urushiol is found throughout all plant parts except for pollen. Direct contact with broken plant tissue or contact with tools, clothing, or pets that have touched the tissue can lead to contact dermatitis in individuals with an allergic response. Severe respiratory irritation can be induced by breathing the smoke from burning plant material. Repeated exposure often results in increased sensitivity. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped to oblong, sit atop short stalks and often are slightly glossy. First leaves consist of three leaflets with a lance-shaped terminal leaflet that is much longer than the football-shaped lateral leaflets. Leaves are opposite to one another along the stem. Mature plant The diversity in leaf size and shape accounts for the Latin species name “diversilobum”. When Pacific poison-oak grows as a shrub, it can reach up to 13 feet (4 m) tall. When it grows in a vinelike or treelike form, stems can reach up to 82 feet (25 m) long. Twigs are hairless to sparsely hairy and gray to reddish brown. Leaves consist of three, and sometimes up to five leaflets but three leaflet leaves are most commonly found. The terminal leaflet has a rounded or tapered base that ends in a short stalk. Leaflet edges are smooth, wavy, or have slightly rounded lobes. The upper leaf surface is hairless, or nearly so, and usually slightly glossy. The lower surface usually has sparse, short hairs. Leaves turn bright red in the autumn. Roots and underground stems are extensive and woody. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through May. Male and female flowers develop on different plants. Small, five-petaled, yellowish-green flowers with flower stalks are produced along loose, drooping branches. Fruits Fruits consist of tiny, round berries that are cream colored or creamy white with dark lines and turn brown as they age. They range from 1/17 to 1/4 of an inch (1.5–6 mm) in diameter, are hairless or have sparse stiff hairs, and contain one seed each. Reproduction Reproduces from seed and by underground stems.

It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites. In apples, it is a host for rosy apple aphid, which reduces yield. Members of the plantain family form basal rosettes and have leafless spikes of inconspicuous flowers. Buckhorn plantain is more tolerant of drought than other plantains. Some buckhorn plantain biotypes can tolerate soils with high heavy metal levels. Habitat Vineyards, orchards, gardens, urban sites, landscaped areas, footpaths, roadsides, turf, crop fields, and other disturbed areas. Seedling Cotyledons are needlelike, fuse at the base, and hairless. The first and subsequent few leaves are narrow, oblong lance shaped, about 4/5 to 1-1/2 inches (20–40 mm) long, and have an especially hairy base gradually tapering to a winged stalk. True leaves are broader, pale green, and have prominent parallel veins. Mature plant Leaves are football shaped; about 3 to 10 inches (8–25 cm) long, and usually have short hairs (or occasionally long hairs). The leaves spiral around a very short stem, clustering around the base of plant. Flower stalks grow up to roughly to 2-1/2 feet (80 cm) tall. Buckhorn plantain has narrower leaves and shorter flower head stalks than that of broadleaf plantain, Plantago major. Buckhorn plantain has simple or branched taproots and, at times, a weakly developed taproot. Flowers Flowering takes place from April through August. Flower heads consist of leafless, slender spikes of inconspicuous flowers clustered densely along an upright flowering head, usually 4/5 to 3 inches (2–8 cm) long, excluding the stalk. Initially the flower head looks egg shaped. Open flowers have protruding white structures called stamens (male flower part). Fruits Fruits consist of egg-shaped capsules roughly 1/6 of an inch (4 mm) long that open below the middle, similar to a cap or a lid. There are usually one to two seeds per capsule.

    "description": "Redroot pigweed, a summer annual broadleaf plant, is found up to 7900 feet (2400 m) in the Central Valley, northwestern region, central-western region, southwestern region, Modoc Plateau, and most likely in other California areas. It thrives in open, sunny places inhabiting agricultural land other disturbed places. Because redroot pigweed can hybridize with other amaranth species, identification to species can be difficult. The plant is named for its pinkish to red taproot. Under certain conditions, free nitrates in redroot pigweed leaves are high enough to be toxic to livestock when consumed. Immediately before flowering, plant levels of nitrate are the highest and oxalate levels can also increase. However, in California there have been no reports of redroot pigweed poisonings in livestock. Actually, because they are rich in nutrients, redroot pigweed has been suggested as forage by some scientists. Habitat Crop fields, vineyards, orchards, pastures, gardens, landscaped areas, roadsides, ditch banks, and other disturbed places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are long, narrow, lance shaped, and often have reddish undersides. Often the cotyledon stalk is reddish, too. The first leaf is egg shaped and has a notched tip. True leaves are much broader than the cotyledons, have notched tips, and their lower surface and main veins are often reddish. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Leaf stalks are generally hairy along the edges. Mature plant Mature plants may grow up to almost 10 feet (3 m) tall but in general are found growing to about 3 ft (1 m). The mature plants have coarse stems, and upper stems that range from hairy to densely hairy. Leaves generally range from 3/5 to 7 inches (1.5–17 cm) long and leaf stalks are 2/5 to 3 inches (1–8 cm) long. Lower leaves are egg to diamond shaped and upper leaves are usually lance shaped. Leaves have prominent veins, are stalked, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Flowers Flowering occurs from June through November. Flowering branches are densely packed with flowers. Inconspicuous flowers cluster to form dense, usually stiff, spikelike terminal clusters with smaller clusters between the main stem and leaf stalks. Fruits The fruits are tiny capsules, less than about 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long. Fruit open around the middle by a caplike lid to release one seed each. Seeds Seeds are round, roughly 1/25 to 1/17 of an inch (1–1.5 mm) in diameter, glossy, and dark reddish brown to black. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Scarlet pimpernel is a low-growing, branching, winter or summer annual, and occasionally, biennial broadleaf plant. It is found throughout California, up to 3300 feet (1000 m), except in the deserts and possibly the Great Basin. Scarlet pimpernel inhabits agricultural land, ornamental landscape beds, turf, water body margins, and other disturbed, open areas. If consumed, it can be toxic to livestock and humans. Toxicity level ranges from virtually nontoxic to fatally toxic and appears to correlate with summer rainfall levels. Although leaves contain saponins and other potentially toxic compounds, it is uncertain as to what substance is responsible for livestock poisonings. If more palatable forage is available, livestock will avoid eating this bitter-leaved plant. Habitat Crop fields, vineyards, orchards, pastures, grassland, turf, gardens, landscaped areas, urban sites, roadsides, margins of vernal pools, streams, marshes, coastal terraces, ocean beaches, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrowly lance, football or egg shaped, hairless, and 1/25 to 1/4 of an inch (1–6 mm) long. True leaves are oval to football shaped with triangular tips, are opposite to one another along the stem, and sometimes have dark glands dotting the lower surface. Mature plant The mature plant grows up to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) tall. Stems are square in cross-section, and grow upright or prostrate. Leaves are stalkless, oval to football shaped with triangular tips, and sometimes dotted with dark or purplish glands on the lower surface. Leaves are opposite to one another along the stem, or sometimes around the stem in a whorl. Common chickweed, Stellaria media, has similar leaves but rather than the square stems and glandular hairs of scarlet pimpernel, it has round stems and nonglandular hairs. Flowers Flowering takes place from March through July. Flowers have five salmon-orange colored petals, slender stalks, and grow singly between the stem and leaf stalks. On rare occasion flowers can be brick red, bright blue or white. They remain closed during cool or cloudy weather. Fruits Fruits are tiny, round capsules about 1/10 to 1/6 of an inch (3–4 mm) in diameter. They are suspended from downward curved stalks. A lid at the top of each capsule opens and releases several seeds. Seeds Seeds are egg to football shaped, threesided, black or brown, 1/25 to 1/16 of an inch (1–1.5 mm) long, and covered with small wartlike projections. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Pennywort is a perennial broadleaf plant with creeping underground stems. One species, lawn pennywort, Hydrocotyle sibthorpioides, is found in the South Coast of California to about 1100 feet (330 m). Another species, floating pennywort, Hydrocotyle ranunculoides, is scattered throughout California, except for the Great Basin and deserts, up to 4900 feet (1500 m). Floating pennywort grows on land or in water. It usually forms dense low-growing mats on wet soil near water or in shallow water. Small colonies can float independently. Floating pennywort is generally considered desirable in aquatic ecosytems. However, because of its creeping habit, it can be problematic in irrigation and drainage ditches. Sold as an aquatic or pond ornamental, floating pennywort has escaped cultivation in some locations. Seedling Seedling leaves in both lawn pennywort and floating pennywort are alternate to one another along the stem. Lawn pennywort cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped and less than 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) in length. They have a rounded to slightly indented tip. The first few leaves are roundish to kidney shaped, about 1/12 to 1/6 of an inch (2–4 mm) long and 1/8 to 1/5 of an inch (3–5 mm) wide, and are deeply lobed at the base. Leaves are hairless and have five to seven shallow lobes on the edge. Mature plant In both floating pennywort and lawn pennywort leaves are hairless, stems root at joints (nodes) and leaf stalks have papery structures (stipules) at their base. Leaves are round or kidney shaped, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Floating pennywort has fleshy leaves, mostly 2/5 to 3 inches (1–8 cm) wide, that are deeply lobed or have smooth to scalloped edges, and sometimes have a reddish spot at the point where the leaf stalk attaches to the stem. Lawn pennywort leaves are usually 2/5 to 4/5 of an inch (1–2 cm) wide and are shallowly lobed with finely scalloped margins. Flowers Small white or greenish flowers with five petals cluster on a flowering stalk called an umbel stalk, forming an umbrellalike flower head. Floating pennywort blooms from March through August; five to ten flowers each with their own stalks attach to the umbel stalk, which is 2/5 to 2-2/5 inches (1–6 cm) long, forming a dense flower head. Under conducive conditions, lawn pennywort blooms almost year-round; its flower head is composed of three to ten flowers that do not have their own stalks, but that attach directly to the umbel stalk, which is about 1/5 to 3/5 of an inch (0.5–1.5 cm) long. Fruits The Fruits are flattened and separate into halves at maturity. Each half contains one seed. Floating pennywort seeds are on stalks, football shaped to round, and 1/25 to 1/8 of an inch (1–3 mm) long with inconspicuous ribs. Lawn pennywort fruit do not have stalks, are round, about 1/25 to 1/21 of an inch (1–1.2 mm) in diameter, and have conspicuous ribs. Reproduction Reproduce by seed or from sprouts that grow from creeping stems and stem fragments.",

    "description": "Perennial pepperweed, an erect perennial broadleaf plant, is highly aggressive and frequently forms dense stands that outcompete and exclude native plants and wildlife. It grows to about 7200 feet (2200 m) throughout California except in the deserts and northern North Coast and neighboring mountains. Goats seem to tolerate feeding on large quantities of fresh perennial pepperweed. However, there have been reports of horses becoming ill after feeding on hay contaminated with it. In California and several other western states it is a state-listed noxious weed. Habitat Perennial pepperweed is found in crops such as alfalfa, vineyards, orchards, and irrigated pastures; ornamental plantings; noncrop areas such as wetlands, meadows, salt marshes, vernal pools, sand dunes, flood plains, riparian areas, roadsides and irrigation ditches; typically found on moist or seasonally wet sites but can tolerate alkaline and saline conditions. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are egg shaped to oblong, about 1/8 to 1/3 inch (3–8 mm) long, hairless, with a rounded tip, and a base that tapers into a short stalk, about 1/12 to 1/8 inch (2–3 mm) long. First leaves are egg shaped to oblong, about 1/6 to 1/2 inch (4–12 mm) long, hairless, with a somewhat rounded tip and a wedge shaped base. The edges of the leaves are smooth to slightly wavy and have a stalk about 1/5 inch (5 mm) long. Later leaves resemble the first leaves but are progressively larger. Young plants Young plants form a basal rosette and can grow from perennial pepperweed rootstock. Mature plant The mature plant grows rigidly erect to about 6-1/2 feet (2 m) tall with multiple branches. The leaves range from lance to football shaped to oblong and are hairless, green to gray green, and alternate along the stem. The stem leaves are reduced, stalkless, or nearly stalkless, with a tapered base, and a smooth to a weakly toothed edged. Basal leaves are larger and wider than the stem leaves up to about 12 inches (30 cm) long and 3-1/5 inches (8 cm) wide with toothed edges on a stalk about 1-1/5 to 6 inches (3–15 cm) long. Its lower stems and crown are somewhat woody and it has extensive creeping roots. Flower Flowers bloom from May through September. Small, white flowers form dense clusters (inflorescence) arranged in branches at the tip of each stem. The top of the inflorescence is pyramid shaped to round. The individual flowers are small, with 4 white spoon-shaped petals about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) long. Fruit Fruit are small, round to somewhat egg-shaped, slightly compressed pods commonly covered in long hairs, about 1/12 inch (2 mm). Each pod has two chambers with one seed per chamber. Seeds Seeds are egg shaped, reddish brown, somewhat flattened, with a weak groove on each side, and about 1/25 inch (1 mm) long and 1/51 inch (0.5 mm) wide. Seeds drop from the pods throughout the winter and some remain in the pods until the next season. There is one seed per fruit pod chamber. Reproduction Perennial pepperweed reproduces from seeds and from root fragments and rootstock and creeping roots. Seeds and root fragments disperse in water, with soil, and agricultural and other human activities. Seeds can cling to animals, tires, shoes, and can contaminate crops, hay, or pasture seed.

It is commonly found inhabiting roadsides, nursery containers, sidewalk cracks, and other disturbed areas—usually on wet gravelly to sandy soil in the coastal areas. It is also found in areas of moist, frequently irrigated turf. It grows year-round, and is often sold as a groundcover for landscapes. Mature plant Prostrate to ascending stems are up to about 7 inches (18 cm) in length. Stems root at joints (nodes) and form a mat. Leaves are narrow, hairless, and have pointed tips. They are opposite to one another along the stem, but may appear to be arranged in whorls around the stem. Flowers Small flowers have four or sometimes five delicate white petals, or sometimes no petals at all. Petals, when present, are difficult to see with the naked eye. At the flowering stage, the plant is usually a rosette of leaves at the base that do not develop a flowering stem. Fruits Fruits consist of small capsules on fruit stalks that typically curve downward. Seeds are spread by water splash. Related or similar plants Corn spurry, Spergula arvensis",

    "description": "Yellow nutsedge is a perennial weed in the sedge family and superficially resembles grass. Nutsedges are among the most noxious weeds of agriculture in temperate to tropical zones worldwide. They are difficult to control, often form dense colonies, and can greatly reduce crop yields. In California, nutsedges are particularly problematic in summer-irrigated annual and perennial crops, but yellow nutsedge is much more widespread than a related species, purple nutsedge, Cyperus rotundus. Yellow nutsedge grows throughout California to an altitude of roughly 3300 feet (1000 m). It resembles another sedge, green kyllinga, Kyllinga brevifolia. Yellow nutsedge is cultivated in some countries for its almond-flavored tubers, which are used to make a drink. Seedling Seedlings are infrequently found. When observed, seedling leaves are similar to that of the mature plant, but smaller with finer leaves. The stem base is slightly triangular and the midvein area is usually pale. The first two to three leaves emerge together, folded lengthwise. Young plant Yellow nutsedge primarily propagates by tubers formed on underground, horizontal creeping stems called rhizomes, mostly in the upper foot of soil. Sprouts from tubers are similar in appearance to the mature plant. Mature plant The yellow nutsedge stem is erect and hairless. Although its leaves superficially resemble grass leaves, they lack collars, ligules, and auricles. The leaves of yellow nutsedge are thicker and stiffer than most grasses, are V-shaped in cross-section, and arranged in sets of three from the base rather than sets of two as in grasses. Yellow nutsedge flowering stems are triangular in cross-section; grass stems are hollow and round. Yellow nutsedge can be distinguished from a related species, purple nutsedge by its longer stems, which grow up to 3 feet (0.9 m) tall; purple nutsedge grows only to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) tall. Yellow nutsedge has light green leaves, a pointed tip, and a leaf width of 1/6 to 2/5 of an inch (4–9 mm); in contrast purple nutsedge has dark green leaves that are 1/8 to 4/17 of an inch (3–6 mm) wide, with rounded tips. Yellow and purple nutsedge can also be distinguished by their tubers. Tubers of yellow nutsedge are produced singly, while purple nutsedge tubers are produced in chains, with several on a single, horizontal, underground stem (rhizome). Another sedge, green kyllinga, Kyllinga brevifolia, has no underground tubers. Flowers Yellow nutsedge spikelets are straw-colored to gold-brown with many flowers. Purple nutsedge spikelets are dark reddish to purplish brown with few flowers per cluster. Green kyllinga has green flowers on compressed flower heads. Fruits The tiny single-seeded fruits (achenes) are football shaped, triangular in cross-section, and brown in yellow nutsedge. Purple nutsedge does not typically produce seed in the United States. Reproduction Reproduces by tubers or \"nutlets\" that grow from horizontal, underground, creeping stems called rhizomes.

Its expansion in its new range has given rise to many genetically distinct ecotypes. Wild oat inhabits agricultural lands and other disturbed areas. It makes good forage for livestock. Habitat Grassland, crop fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, roadsides, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Seedlings have hairy leaves, like hare barley, Hordeum murinum ssp. leporinum. However, in wild oat, the seed clings to the seedling from which it is growing for a long time. Mature plant The sturdy, mature plant grows to about 4 feet (1.2 m) tall.

In California it is found in the North Coast, Central Coast, western San Francisco Bay region, western South Coast Ranges, Klamath Ranges, Cascade Range foothills, Central Valley, and Santa Cruz Island up to 3300 feet (1000 m). It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. It is one of the most problematic of the nightshades. Nightshades are considered weeds because they can harbor diseases and pests that affect closely related crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers. Some nightshade biotypes are resistant to certain herbicides. Another issue with hairy nightshade is that mature plants can form a sticky mass that clogs harvesting machinery. Nightshades contain several glycoalkaloid compounds that can be toxic to humans and livestock when consumed. The level of toxicity depends on factors such as plant maturity and environmental conditions. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, crop fields, pastures, gardens, yards, fields, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrowly egg shaped to lance shaped and about 1/6 to 2/5 of an inch (4–10 mm) long. The stalk below the cotyledons is usually covered with glandular hairs. First true leaves of hairy nightshade have wavy edges and prominent veins. Later leaves are increasingly larger, egg shaped, dark green and often purple tinged, with a smooth to slighly wavy edge, and covered with glandular hairs. Black nightshade seedlings are similar but have nonglandular and some glandular hairs. Mature plant Hairy nightshade is a bushy plant that reaches 3-1/3 feet (0.9 m) tall. Perennial forms of the plant sometimes are slightly woody at the base. Althoughs leaves vary they are overall egg shaped with a smooth to wavy edge or an irregular, shallow-toothed edge. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Leaves have numerous conspicuous, fine, short hairs, especially along the underside of the main vein, distinguishing it from black nightshade, which is inconspicuously covered with minute hairs. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October. Two to eight star-shaped, usually white flowers grow in a cluster. The inside of the petals sometimes are flecked with purple. Another species, silverleaf nightshade, S. elaeagnifolium, has colorful showy flowers. Fruits Mature berries are glossy, yellowish green to purplish green or light brown, never black. Green lobes cover more or less half of the berry. Another species, silverleaf nightshade has yellow to orange berries. Black nightshade berries are black or purplish black. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Black Nightshade, Solanum nigrum Silverleaf Nightshade, Solanum elaeagnifolium",

    "description": "Silverleaf nightshade, a deep-rooted broadleaf perennial, is common throughout California to 3900 feet (1200 m) except in the North Coast, Klamath Ranges, and Great Basin. It is particularly widespread in California's desert valleys, especially in poorly managed fields. Sometime silverleaf nightshade is troublesome in agricultural areas, particularly tomatoes and cotton fields. Large infestations can reduce crop yield and pasture production by competing for soil water and nutrients with desired plants. Once established, it is difficult to eradicate and reduced tillage favors it. Often more problematic are its relatives, black nightshade, S. nigrum, and hairy nightshade, S. sarrachoides, and horsenettle, S. carolinense. Leaves and berries contain varying amounts of glycoalkaloid compounds that can be toxic to humans and livestock when consumed. However, berries are eaten by many bird species and small mammals. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, crop fields, rangeland, pastures, forest openings, roadsides, and disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are gray-green, narrowly lance shaped and up to 2/5 of an inch (10 mm) long. The first true leaves have wavy edges and are covered with small star-shaped hairs, which require 20X magnification to observe. Mature plant The mature plant is 1 to 3 feet (30–90 cm) tall and has many branches and an open form. Leaves are egg shaped to lance shaped, reach 6 inches (15 cm) long, usually have wavy to coarsely lobed edges, are alternate to one another along the stem, and are covered with dense, short, star-shaped hairs (visible with 20X magnification). The dense covering of hairs give the leaves a dull, silvery green to pale yellowish-green color. Stems often have prickles which range from tan to reddish. Creeping stems produce young shoots that are a dusky, silver-gray and resemble seedlings but do not have cotyledons. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through September. They are showy, 4/5 to 1-1/5 inches (20–30 mm) in diameter and have deep violet to light blue (sometimes white) fused petals with yellow centers. Flowers cluster along branches of the flowering stem and the oldest flower grows singly at the tip of the main stem. Fruits Mature berries are 1/3 to 3/5 of an inch (8–15 mm) in diameter, globe shaped, and greenish yellow to brownish orange. Seeds Seeds are tiny, less than 1/6 of an inch (4 mm) in diameter, semi-glossy, and yellowish brown to dark yellow brown. Reproduction Reproduces by seed and creeping roots that give rise to bud shoots.

They are among the most problematic weeds of agriculture in temperate to tropical zones worldwide. They are difficult to control, often form dense colonies, and can greatly reduce crop yields. In California, nutsedges are particularly problematic in summer-irrigated annual and perennial crops. Yellow nutsedge, Cyperus esculentus, grows throughout California to an altitude of roughly 3300 feet (1000 m). Purple nutsedge, Cyperus rotundus, is not as widespread in California, but does grow in the Central Valley, South Coast, and low desert, to about 820 feet (250 m). Seedling Seedlings are rarely found. Seedling leaves look similar to that of mature plants, but are smaller and finer. The stem base is slightly triangular and the midvein area is usually pale. The first two to three leaves emerge together, folded lengthwise. Young plant Nutsedges grow mainly from tubers formed on underground, horizontal creeping stems called rhizomes, mostly in the upper foot of soil. Sprouts from tubers are similar in appearance to the mature plant. Mature plant Sedge stems are erect and hairless. Although sedge leaves superficially resemble grass leaves, they lack collars, ligules, and auricles. Sedge leaves are thicker and stiffer than most grasses, are V-shaped in cross-section, and arranged in sets of three from the base rather than sets of two as found in grass leaves. Sedge stems are triangular in cross-section; grass stems are hollow and round. Yellow nutsedge stems grow to 3 feet (0.9 m) tall and its leaves are light green, and have pointed tips. Purple nutsedge stems grow to 1-1/3 feet (0.4 m) tall and have dark green leaves with rounded leaf tips. Tubers of yellow nutsedge are produced singly while purple nutsedge tubers are produced in chains, with several on a single rhizome. Flowers Purple nutsedge spikelets are dark reddish to purplish brown. Yellow nustsedge spikelets are straw-colored to gold-brown with many flowers. Fruits Yellow nutsedge has tiny, single-seeded fruit (achenes) that are football shaped, triangular in cross-section, and brown. Purple nutsedge does not typically produce seeds in the United States. Reproduction Both nutsedge species reproduce by underground tubers that are attached to underground stems. Yellow nutsedge also produce seed in California, but they have low viability and are not considered a more source of reproduction and spread.

In California, it is found in the North Coast, northern Central Coast, San Francisco Bay region, Central Valley, southern coastal California, western Transverse and Peninsular Ranges, up to 660 feet (200 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Black nightshade is a member of a complex of closely related species that can be highly variable, making identification difficult. Black nightshade is one of the most problematic of the nightshades. They, and other nightshade species, can harbor diseases and pests that affect closely related crops such as tomatoes, potatoes, and peppers.

Cultivars of some mustards have been developed for oil, seasoning, and fodder. However, cultivars that escape hybridize readily with wild types. Wild mustards (and cultivated ones) can harbor pests and diseases that damage closely related crops. Roots, leaves, and especially seeds of Brassica and related species have sulfur-containing compounds. When consumed in large quantities over time, these compounds can irritate the digestive tracts and cause thyroid problems in livestock. Mustards may become a fire hazard when they dry up at the end of their growing season. Seedling All mustard seedlings have broad cotyledons (seed leaves) that are more or less kidney shaped, broader than long, hairless, and have a deep notch at the tip. Their stalks are longer than the cotyledon blade. The first true leaves are bright green on the upper surface and paler below. Mature plant Stems are branched and their upper portions are usually hairless. Leaves are toothed, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Basal leaves are somewhat lobed and the lobe at the tip is round to somewhat round. Upper stem leaves are reduced and stalkless. Flowers Mature mustards have dense clusters of four-petaled, yellow flowers at the tips of branches. Fruits The Fruits are pods 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch (13–19 mm) long and approximately 1/12 inch (3.7 cm) broad. They are tipped with short slender beaks and stand close to the stem, often overlapping one another.

Burning nettle is found througout much of California, to 9800 feet (3000 m), except for the Klamath Ranges, upper elevations of the Cascade Range, and deserts. It inhabits agricultural lands and other disturbed sites. Skin contact with the hairs of this plant usually causes a burning or stinging sensation for several minutes. This may be followed by a longer period of itching or numbness. A related species, stinging nettle, Urtica dioica, also causes a burning or stinging sensation. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, ditches, nurseries, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are rounded, smooth edged and have a small notch at the tip. The first true leaves are oval, sparsely hairy, have distinctly toothed edges, sit atop short stalks, and are opposite to one another along the stem. Mature plant Mature plants are 5 to 24 inches (12.5—60 cm) tall, with square stems that branch from the base. Most of the plant's stinging hairs are located on the stems, leaf stalks, and lower surface of leaves. Leaves are elliptical to egg shaped, have toothed edges, and besides stinging hairs, have short non-stinging hairs, and often minute glands. Burning nettle has a slender taproot, often with many lateral roots. The related stinging nettle plant is taller and its leaves are less rounded than those of burning nettle.

    "description": "Tumble mustard, also known as Jim Hill mustard, is a broadleaf winter or summer annual and sometimes biennial plant with a highly branched top. Tumble mustard is found throughout California up to an elevation of 8200 feet (2500 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, gardens, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, landscaped areas, roadsides, and other disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling The seedling has very small cotyledons (seed leaves) that are egg shaped to oblong, about 1/12 to 1/5 of an inch (2–6 mm) long and about 1/25 to 1/12 of an inch (1–2 mm) wide. They have no apparent stem. The first true leaf is slightly larger than the cotyledons, dull green, coarsely toothed, has an elongate football shape, and a few hairs along the edge and on the upper surface. Later leaves are similar to the first, but grow increasing larger and have shallow-toothed margins. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Young plant Tumble mustard exists as a rosette until the flower stem develops at maturity. Leaves at the base of young winter rosettes are coarse and deeply lobed. Leaves near the top are smaller and deeply cut to form threadlike divisions. Although the rosette leaves of London rocket, Sisymbrium irio, and tumble mustard have similarities; those of tumble mustard have terminal lobes that are more triangular, while those of London rocket are egg shaped. Mature plant Stems are erect and branched. The plant can reach a height of 5 feet (1.5 m) tall. The related London rocket only reaches 1-3/5 feet (0.5 m) in height. Leaves at the base of tumble mustard (rosette leaves) are coarse and deeply divided, or lobed to compound (fully divided into separate leaflets), have stalks, and are about 6 inches (15 cm) long. Upper leaves are stalkless, smaller than the lower leaves, deeply cut to form threadlike divisions, and do not clasp the stem. Long unbranched hairs sparsely cover leaves. In contrast, London rocket’s upper leaves are oblong and have two spreading lobes at the base. Flixweed, Descurainia sophia, can be distinguished by its branched hairs compared to the unbranched hairs of tumble mustard. Also flixweed has very finely divided leaves whose leaflets are often finely divided once or twice again (tumble mustard leaves are divided only once). Russian thistle, Salsola tragus, has leaves that graduate into rigid, spine-tipped scalelike structures (bracts) in the flower head, while in tumble mustard, upper leaves remain threadlike. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through September. Tiny, pale yellow (rarely white) flowers with four petals cluster on thick, spreading stalks. Fruits The fruit, produced on a short stalk, is a one-ribbed, narrow pod about 1/24 of an inch (1 mm) wide and 2 to 4 inches (5–10 cm) long. Pods point somewhat upwards. Seeds Seeds are oblong, roughly 1/24 of an inch (1 mm) long, half as wide, and brownish yellow to dull orange. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Mature plants tend to break off at the base and tumble in the wind, which shakes loose and spreads seed.

    "description": "Turkey mullein is a summer annual broadleaf plant that grows in open, dry areas. It is a native of California that usually requires a disturbance to establish and is found throughout to 3300 feet (1000 m), except for the Great Basin and central and eastern deserts. Turkey mullein is generally considered a desirable member of natural vegetation communities. Birds and small mammals depend on its seeds for food. Sometimes, however, it is problematic in agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Turkey mullein is killed by frost and grows poorly in wet areas. Livestock generally avoid turkey mullein when more suitable forage is present. When ingested, the fibrous, indigestible hairs can create blockages in the digestive track. Most problems occur when livestock eat contaminated hay. Leaves contain a substance toxic to fish and other compounds that discourage insect feeding. Habitat Dry pastures, vineyards, orchards, rangeland, summer-fallowed fields, dry sandy washes, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling The cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to egg shaped and covered with star-shaped hairs, which give the plant a gray-green, mealy appearance. The first few leaves are oval to heart shaped, densely covered with star-shaped hairs and larger than the cotyledons. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem, are pale gray-green, and give off a strong scent when crushed. Mature plant The mature plant is low growing and often has a mounded shape from about 8 to 31 inches (20–80 cm) in diameter. Stems and leaves are densely covered with bristly, star-shaped hairs. The leaves are thick, oval to nearly round, and when crushed, have an unpleasantly sweet odor and a clear sap. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October. They are small, inconspicuous, lack petals, and arise in clusters at the tip of branches, or at the junction where the stem and the stalks of lower leaves meet. Fruits Fruits are oblong, roughly 1/6 of an inch (4 mm) long, hairy, and have one chamber. Seeds Seeds are oblong to egg shaped, with a rounded back. The surface is smooth, dark brown or black with a white to gray mottling, or gray with black stripes. Seeds are about 1/8 to 1/6 of an inch (3–4 mm) in length. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Black medic is a low-growing summer or winter annual broadleaf plant that sometimes behaves as a short-lived perennial. It is found throughout California, except for deserts, to about 8200 feet (2500 m). Black medic is common in turf and inhabits agricultural land and disturbed areas. It is good forage for livestock and sometimes is cultivated for pasture or as a cover crop. However, black medic seed is a common contaminant in commercial alfalfa and clover seed. Habitat Grassland, pastures, vegetable and agronomic crop fields (especially alfalfa), orchards, vineyards, gardens, lawns, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oblong, smooth, and about 1/6 to 1/3 of an inch (4–9 mm) long. The first leaf is oval and broader than it is long, with a smooth edge. True leaves are fully subdivided consisting of three egg-shaped leaflets with toothed edges and resemble leaves of the mature plant. Mature plant The main stem branches near the base. Stems grow prostrate or prostrate with tips pointing upward and can reach 1-1/3 feet (40 cm) long. The plant is hairy, especially the stems. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Leaves are fully divided into three egg- to heart-shaped leaflets with somewhat toothed edges. Leaflets are about 2/5 to 7/10 of an inch (1–2 cm) long and finely toothed at the tip, which often bares a tiny, slender tooth. The stalk of the middle leaflet is longer than those of the lateral leaflets. Black medic is distinguished from California burclover by its hairy leaves; the latter has nearly hairless leaves. Also the small leaflike structures (stipules) at the bases of leaf stalks are not deeply lobed and have smooth edges or a few shallow teeth in black medic, whereas those of California burclover are deeply lobed, slender and curved. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through July. Usually ten to twenty yellow, slender, pealike flowers densely cluster to form a rounded flower head. Fruits Fruits are kidney-shaped pods about 1/12 to 1/8 of an inch (2–3 mm) long, strongly veined, and black at maturity. Each pod contains one seed, but does not open to release seeds. Seeds Seeds are oval to barely kidney shaped, smooth, yellowish to olive green, about 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) long, and have a small sharp point on the concave side. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

Japanese morningglory grows best in moist places and does not tolerate freezing conditions. Morningglories are often cultivated as ornamentals, however, under favorable conditions they can become problematic weeds, especially in cotton fields. Control is critical from crop emergence to harvest. Destroy morningglories at the seedling stage, because once they have twined up stems they are difficult to control without injuring the crop. When buried in the soil, seeds survive for long periods. Seeds of Ipomoea species contain many alkaloid compounds, some of which are neurotoxins when ingested by humans and animals. Fortunately, there is not enough seed in contaminated grain to cause harm to livestock. Habitat Agronomic and vegetable crop fields, gardens, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, and disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling Seedlings emerge typically when moisture conditions are favorable. The cotyledons (seed leaves) are butterfly-shaped, hairless, and somewhat glossy, with nearly equal width and length. It is more deeply notched and much larger than field bindweed, Convolvulus arvensis, cotyledons. The cotyledon stalk is long and usually purplish red at the base. First true leaves are heart-shaped with deep lobes at the base. Japanese morningglory has erect to somewhat erect hairs on the stems, leaf stalks, and veins, whereas, tall morningglory, Ipomoea purpurea, a similar species, has minute hairs that usually lie flat and are more or less evenly distributed on the leaf surface. Mature plant Long stems branch, twine, and climb. Leaves, most often are 1-1/5 to 3 inches (3 to 8 cm) long, heart shaped and/or three lobed. They are alternate to one another along the stem. Short stiff hairs cover the plant surface, especially on the stems and stalks. Leaves are more or less sparsely hairy, with most hairs on the leaf veins. Flowers Flowers bloom from June to November.

    "description": "Blessed milkthistle is a common winter or summer annual or biennial broadleaf plant. In California, it is found on the North Coast, North Coast Ranges, Central Valley, San Francisco Bay region, South Coast Ranges, South Coast, and Channel Islands, to about 1600 feet (500 m). It often forms dense competitive stands. Plants range from extremely small to very tall, depending on soil moisture levels and soil fertility. Blessed milkthistle inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Under stressful conditions like drought, mowing, or herbicide treatment, leaves can accumulate nitrate levels toxic to cattle. In 1971 a seed-eating weevil was released in southern California as a biological control agent for blessed milkthistle, but control to date has not been successful and the weevil attacks several native thistles. Blessed milkthistle has been used as a medicinal herb for at least 2000 years. Habitat Pastures, agronomic crop fields, orchards, trail margins of chaparral communities and woodlands; roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling Seedlings have thick, succulent cotyledons (seed leaves) that are broadly egg shaped, hairless, and about 2/5 to 3/5 of an inch (1–1.5 cm) long. The first pair of leaves are football to oblong in shape, hairless, and mottled, with white around the veins. Seedling leaves are typically 2/5 to 4/5 of an inch (1–2 cm) long, with a prickly-toothed edge, and are alternate to one another along the stem. Mature plant Mature plants are stiff, erect, sparsely branched and have prickly, white-marked leaves. Stem branches are thick, hollow, ribbed, sparsely hairy, lack wings or spines and grow 2 to 6-1/2 feet (0.6–2 m) tall. Lower leaves are 6 to 28 inches (15–70 cm) long, with leaf size diminishing towards the top of the plant. Leaves are spiny and deeply lobed and the leaf base wraps around the stem. All leaves show a characteristic white mottling or marbling around veins that distinguishes milkthistle from other related weedy species such as prickly lettuce, annual sowthistle, Canada thistle, and bull thistle. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through July. Flower heads are pink to purple, nearly round, shiny and have long stalks. Beneath the flower head, large green scalelike structures, called bracts, bear spines up to 2 inches (5 cm) long. Fruits Fruits are one-seeded (achene), smooth, flat, shiny, mottled black and brown, about 1/4 to 1/3 of an inch (6–8 mm) long, and have a tuft of bristles. Eventually the bristles detach as a unit, leaving a yellowish ring on the achene at the point of detachment. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

At least twelve lovegrass species or subspecies occur in California and the western United States. Some species are called stinkgrasses and have tiny wartlike glands on their leaves and flower spikes, which give off an unpleasant odor. Lovegrasses inhabits agricultural lands and other disturbed sites. Habitat Agronomic and vegetable crop fields, gardens, orchards, nurseries, yards, irrigated pastures, and other disturbed locations. Seedling The first cotyledon (seedling leaf) is very narrow, light green, and inconspicuous. A seedling's second and third leaves are light green, short, and roughly 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm) wide with tufts of hair arising from base of the third leaf. Mature plant Plants can grow upright, sprawling, or both, and range from a few inches wide or tall to over 6-1/2 feet (2 m), depending on the species and location. Sheaths are open and glands, when present, consist of tiny, slightly raised bumps with a pit in the center. Collar region Ligules have a fringe of straight hairs with a tuft of long hairs on either side of the collar. The protruding hairs on the sheath just below the collar (where the leaf base wraps around the stem), helps to distinguish mature lovegrasses from most other grasses. There are no auricles. Flowers The flowering heads branch, are often gray-green, and consist of flowers clustered in spikelets. The spikelets are narrowly lance shaped or oblong and lack needlelike awns. Fruits The spikelets are narrowly lance shaped or oblong and lack needlelike awns. Seeds Numerous, tiny, egg shaped or lens-shaped seeds are produced. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

It is found throughout California (except for the lower desert areas) to about 6600 feet (2000 m). Miner’s lettuce inhabits natural plant communities, agricultural land, and urban areas, with a preference for cool, damp conditions. It dries up with the onset of hot spring weather. Although the leaves are sometimes cultivated or collected for salad greens, occasionally it accumulates soluble oxalates, which can be toxic when ingested.. Habitat Chaparral, oak, woodlands, forests, and coastal sage scrub, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, yards, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are bright green, slightly succulent, linear and narrow, and broadest at the tip. The first true leaf and later leaves are narrowly to normally lance-shaped with bases that taper to the stalk. These leaves form a basal rosette. Miner's lettuce seedlings are distinguished from redmaids, which lack definite stalks and have somewhat broader and fleshier leaves. Young plant The young plant is found as a basal rosette. Mature plant Mature plants have numerous erect to spreading, slender stems that branch from the base and reach up to 8 inches (20 cm) in length. Leaves are mostly basal, slightly succulent, hairless, and bright green. Leaf shape varies from football shaped to triangular-kidney shaped with rounded or pointy tips. The flower stalk appears to “grow through” a circular cuplike structure (bract) that looks like a leaf and surrounds the entire stem. Subspecies perfoliata has football to egg-diamond shaped leaves and subspecies mexicana has egg-diamond shaped to triangular-kidney-shaped leaves. Flowers Flowers bloom from February through May. Five to forty white to pale pink flowers on slender down-curved stalks cluster above a circular to weakly squared, often cuplike, green structure (bract) that looks like a leaf and completely surrounds the stem. Fruits Tiny, egg-shaped, green, open pods, 1/17 to 1/6 of an inch (1.5–4 mm) are enclosed by green petal-like sepals and contain two to six seeds.

    "description": "Common lambsquarters, a broadleaf plant, is among the most common summer annuals. It is found throughout California up to an elevation of 5900 feet (1800 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Generally common lambsquarters is considered edible. However under certain conditions, plant production of oxalates can increase to levels toxic to livestock when large amounts of leaves are consumed in a short time period. Common lambsquarter is also susceptible to many viruses that affect several crops and ornamentals. These include beet curly top; potato viruses X, M, and S; ringspot viruses of tomato, pepper, potato, Prunus species, and mulberry; and mosaic viruses of alfalfa, bean, beet, barley, lettuce, cucumber, squash, eggplant, hops, primula, watermelon, and wisteria. Many species of small mammals and birds consume the seeds. Habitat Fields, pastures, agronomic and vegetable croplands, gardens, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, roadsides, and other disturbed locations. Seedling The cotyledons and early true leaves are dull bluish green above and often purplish red below. Cotyledons (seed leaves) are narrow, oblong to lance shaped, about 1/6 to 3/5 of an inch (4–15 mm) long, with nearly parallel sides, and stalks that are often purple tinged. The first leaves appear to be opposite to one another along the stem and are almost equal, or somewhat larger than the cotyledons. Leaves are oblong egg shaped to triangular egg shaped and often fold upward along the midvein. Leaf edges are smooth to weakly wavy-toothed and are initially covered with clear, glistening granules that develop into a white powdery coating over time, especially on the lower surface. Mature plant Common lambsquarters is an erect plant that can grow up to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall, depending on moisture and soil fertility. Leaves are generally dull and pale gray green, triangular egg shaped to lance shaped, about 2/5 to 2 inches (1–5 cm) long, and have thin stalks that are about half as long as the leaf blade. Lower leaves usually have three main veins that extend from the base that are usually less than 1-1/2 times the width. Leaf surfaces, especially on new growth, are covered with a fine white powdery coating. Stems are single or may have a few rigid, angled branches and are sometimes striated purplish red. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through November. Tiny, green, stalkless flowers are packed in dense clusters at the tips of the main stem and branches. The tiny flowers lack petals, and like the leaves, are also covered in a white powdery coating. Seeds Seeds are tiny and plants produce two types—smaller black seeds and larger brown ones.

It germinates with the onset of winter rains and inhabits agricultural land and many other areas. Habitat Annual grasslands, seasonal wetlands, ditchbanks, fields, agronomic and vegetable croplands, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, urban places, roadsides, and is a prolific colonizer of disturbed habitats. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oblong football shaped to egg shaped, often have slightly indented tips, have bases that abruptly taper into a short stalk, and usually have a few fine, gland-tipped hairs, especially on the edges. The first and later leaves are egg shaped to football shaped, have smooth edges or are weakly toothed, have rounded tips, and have bases that gradually taper into a short stalk. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem and are mostly 2 to 2-1/2 times longer than wide. Leaves that form the rosette have stiff bristles on the lower midvein.

    "description": "Green kyllinga is a perennial sedge with narrow, grasslike leaves. In the warm season, green kyllinga grows more rapidly than most turfgrasses; its dense mats can even crowd out bermudagrass. Although it is most problematic in turf and ornamental plantings it also inhabits ditches and landscaped areas. In California it is found to about 1000 feet (300 m) in the Central Valley from Sacramento to Southern California, in the South and Central Coast regions from San Diego County probably to southeastern San Francisco Bay, but is not usually associated with agricultural land in the state. The plant grows best in moist or wet areas that receive full sun, but it can survive some shade and drying once established. Mature plant The mature plant can reach about 1-3/5 feet (50 cm) tall, but is usually much shorter and can tolerate even close mowing. It has one to three dark green, glossy, flat, hairless leaves that on average range from 2-2/5 to 6 inches (6–15 cm) long. Leaf edges and the lower midvein are sparsely covered with tiny barbs that are rough to the touch. Green kyllinga is dormant during the cool season, remaining green in mild-winter areas, and turning brown or purplish brown in colder regions. Although similar looking to yellow or purple nutsedge, green kyllinga does not have underground tubers and has green rather than yellow or purple flowers. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October and sometimes earlier in warm locations. Flowering stalks are triangular in cross-section and terminate in a globular, dense flower head consisting of green flowers. A group of three long leaflike structures (bracts) radiates out from the stalk beneath the flower head. There are thirty to seventy-five spikelets within each flower head, each one capable of producing one seed. Seeds Seeds are flat, oval, roughly 1/8 of an inch (3 mm) long, half as wide, and germinate from spring through summer. Reproduction Reproduces by seed and from horizontal, creeping, underground stems (rhizomes) that can produce new shoots. Under appropriate conditions, new plants can form from rhizome fragments that have at least one stem joint (node).

    "description": "Kochia is an erect summer annual broadleaf plant that is difficult to differentiate from fivehook bassia, Bassia hyssopifolia. In California it is found in the Central Valley, San Francisco Bay region, Central Coast, South Coast, Mojave and Sonoran deserts, and the Great Basin to about 4900 feet (1500 m). Kochia inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Although it can provide good livestock forage in modest amounts, its leaves contain saponins and small amounts of oxalates and nitrates, which can be toxic to livestock. Habitat Roadsides, fields, disturbed places, crop fields (especially newly planted), ditch margins, and seasonal wetlands. Seedling Seedlings are indistinguishable from fivehook bassia seedlings. They emerge in spring and have thick, dull green leaves with magenta undersides. The hairless cotyledons (seed leaves) range from linear to narrowly lance shaped. Later leaves are narrowly lance shaped, gray green, and covered with long, soft, white hairs. Young plant The young plant forms a small rosette. Mature plant Mature kochia grows from 2 to 5 feet (60–150 cm) tall and is usually branched from the base, compared to fivehook bassia, which branches along the main stem. Leaves are mostly linear to lance shaped, flat, generally gray green, usually covered with soft hairs (kochia is less hairy than fivehook bassia), have smooth edges, and are alternate to one another along the stem. They range from 1/5 to 2-2/5 inches (5–60 mm) long and from 1/25 to 2/5 of an inch (1–10 mm) wide. Stems are sometimes reddish late in the season. Flowers Flowers bloom from July through October. The flower head is a spike. It is formed by clusters of inconspicuous, green, petal-less, stalkless flowers that grow in the axils of reduced leaves. The axil is where the leaf base meets the stem. Fruits Generally fruits have knoblike lobes or short horizontal wings. Seeds Seeds are egg shaped, flattened, and roughly 1/25 to 1/12 of an inch (1–2 mm). Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

Knotgrass is found throughout California, except in the Mojave and Sonoran deserts, up to 5400 feet (1650 m). Although it is a good forage grass and is used for controlling erosion in ditches and canal banks, it can be problematic in crops, along water body margins, and in other disturbed places. It is often considered desirable in natural areas; its seeds and leaves serve as forage for numerous animals and birds. Habitat Irrigation and drainage ditches, canals, pond and reservoir margins, marshes, riparian areas, moist grassland, seasonal wetlands, stream banks, moist disturbed areas, roadsides, turf, rice fields, irrigated perennial crops, orchards, and vineyards. Mature plant Mature knotgrass forms mats and grows up to 2 feet (60 cm) long. The stem is round in cross-section and stems range from erect to prostrate with erect tips. Leaves are flat, often keeled at the base, and hairless except for a few long hairs at the base. Sheaths are open and usually are covered with long hairs. Leaves are rolled in the bud. Collar region The edge of the collar usually has a few long hairs. Ligules are membranous and somewhat squared at the top. There are no auricles. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through October. The flower head is \"V\"-shaped, formed by two (sometimes three) branches. The main flowering stem can be up to 6 inches (15 cm) long. The branches grow from about 2/5 to 2-2/5 inches (1–6 cm) long.

It is found throughout California up to 8200 feet (2500 m). Common knotweed can thrive even on poor and compacted soil and inhabits agricultural land, nursery grounds, and other disturbed areas. This plant often attracts predatory insects. Common knotweed seeds serve as forage for songbirds and small animals. Habitat Roadsides, fields, agronomic croplands (especially alfalfa), orchards, vineyards, yards, turf, gardens, landscaped areas, nursery grounds, paths, walkways, and disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are long, about 1/6 to 3/5 of an inch (4–15 mm) in length, very narrow, rounded at the tip, bluish green with a white powdery coating—especially on the lower surface, and continue to elongate over time. They are fused together at the base and the first true leaf emerges from the \"cup\" formed between them. True leaves are much broader than the cotyledon, stalkless, are alternate to one another along the stem, and taper toward the base. Mature plant Common knotweed is a prostrate annual plant with numerous slender, wiry stems that are highly branched and form mats. The extensive branching gives it a zigzag appearance. Stems are round in cross-section, can reach 4 feet (1.2 m) long, and have longitudinal ribs that are often slightly swollen at the joints (nodes). Leaves are linear to narrowly football shaped, stalkless, are alternate to one another along the stem, and are about 1/5 to 4/5 of an inch (0.5–2 cm) long. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through November. The inconspicuous flower heads are found at the top of short stalks that grow from the bases of leaves. They consist of a cluster of two to eight tiny, green flowers with white or pink edges. Fruits Fruits are tiny, about 1/8 of an inch (3 mm), one seeded, and enclosed by the flower petals and sepals. Removing the flower petals and sepals, reveals a fruit that contains one seed, is somewhat egg shaped, three sided, dull or slightly glossy, and dark brown. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

Jimsonweed is found throughout much of California to about 4900 feet (1500 m) except it is generally not found in the deserts, Klamath ranges, and higher regions of the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada. It inhabits agricultural land and managed or open disturbed places. Leaves have an unpleasant odor when slightly bruised. It is a strong competitor for water and grows rapidly. Habitat Fields, pastures, agronomic and vegetable crop lands, orchards, vineyards, ditchbanks, livestock enclosures, roadsides and other open or unmanaged disturbed places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are long, narrow, lance shaped and expand with age. They can grow 2/5 to 2 inches (10–50 mm) in length. The main stalk below the cotyledons is long, hairy, and usually deep violet. First true leaves are spade shaped with many veins and, at times, appear somewhat puckered. When leaves are crushed they give off an unpleasant odor. Mature plant Mature plants grow erect, and reach from 1-3/4 to 4 feet (52.5–120 cm) tall.

Introduced to California to control erosion on hillsides, it has escaped cultivation and become weedy in many agricultural and landscape situations in California. It is found in the North and Central Coast, southwest regions, San Francisco Bay region, and Santa Cruz Island to about of 3300 feet (1000 m). Kikuyugrass inhabits agricultural land, turf, landscaped areas, and other disturbed locations. Under certain conditions it may accumulate levels of oxalates and nitrates that are toxic to livestock when consumed in quantity. Habitat Urban places, gardens, landscaped areas, orchards, cropland, turf, forested sites, occasionally wetland areas, roadsides and other disturbed sites. Seedling Leaf blades are light green and narrow with a few short hairs. Mature plant The mature plant forms a low mat with creeping underground, horizontal stems (rhizomes) and stout creeping aboveground, horizontal stems (stolons) that grow to 20 inches (about 50 cm) or more in length. The stolons are usually flattened, or slightly so, and have many swollen stem joints (nodes) with brown sheaths below them. Leaves are rolled or folded in the bud. There are two long, wide leaves on non-flowering stems. Flower-bearing stems are short and have stiff leaf blades. Leaves of kikuyugrass are light green in color and range in length from 1 to 10 inches (2.5–25 cm) long and about 1/8 to 1/4 of an inch (0.3–0.6 cm) wide. Leaf blades are flat with pointed leaf tips. Collar region The collar is pale. The ligule consists of a fringe of fine hairs, unequal in length. There is no auricle. Flowers Flowers bloom from April though October but are generally obvious only in the mornings when humid and cool. Flower heads are short. Often the long white filament supporting the anthers (male structures) protrude. Sometimes both the anthers and stigmas (female structures) protrude from the flowering stem. Seeds Seeds are shiny, dark brown, 1/8 of an inch (3 mm) long, and have a large attachment scar at the base. Reproduction Kikuyugrass reproduces primarily by fragments of aboveground and belowground horizontal, creeping stems (stolons and rhizomes respectively) and to a lesser extent by seed. Rhizome and stolon fragments, as well as seed, disperse by landscape maintenance activities, and as contaminants of soil and water movement, agricultural machinery, and hand tools.

It rapidly produces colonies, is very competitive with crop plants, and is especially a problem in California cotton fields. In California, johnsongrass is found in the Central Valley, Cascade Range foothills, Western California, and the Sierra Nevada foothills to about 2600 feet (800 m). It inhabits agricultural land, and other disturbed sites. Johnsongrass hybridizes with grain sorghum (milo). Under certain conditions, the leaves of johnsongrass (and sorghum) can produce toxic amounts of hydrocyanic acid, which can poison livestock when ingested. It is a highly variable species with some regional biotypes. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, ditchbanks, disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, and agronomic and vegetable crop fields. Seedling Although it resembles a young corn seedling, a johnsongrass seedling can be distinguished by its football- to egg-shaped, dark reddish-brown to black seed, which remains attached after carefully removing the seedling from soil. The first leaf blade is parallel to the ground. Leaf blades are hairless with smooth edges and have a midvein that is whitish at the base. Mature plant Mature johnsongrass grows in spreading, leafy tufts with shoots (tillers) sprouting from the base (crown). Stems stand erect, from 6 to 7 feet (1.8–2.1 m) tall, and are unbranched. Leaves are rolled in the bud. The blade is flat, hairless to sparsely hairy, especially near the ligules. Sheathes are open, hairless to sparsely hairy near the collar, and pale green to reddish. The leaf has a prominent whitish midvein, which snaps readily when folded over. Underground stems are thick, fleshy, and segmented. Roots and shoots can sprout from these segments. Collar region Ligules are membranous and generally have a fringe of hairs at the top. There are no auricles. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through October. The flower head is large, open, well branched and has an overall pyramid outline. Initially it is green or greenish violet. At maturity it becomes a dark reddish or purplish brown.

    "description": "Russian knapweed, a widely distributed perennial broadleaf plant, is listed as a Class B noxious weed in California. Except for the wettest areas of the northwest and driest regions of the Great Basin and deserts, it is found throughout California to about 6200 feet (1900 m). Russian knapweed inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed places. Aggressively competitive, this plant can rapidly colonize an area and develop dense stands. Extensive roots systems enable some populations to be extremely long lived. Like yellow starthistle, Russian knapweed is toxic to horses and can cause \"chewing disease\" to animals when certain levels are consumed. Habitat Fields, rangeland, cultivated sites, orchards, vineyards, roadsides, ditchbanks, and disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Seedlings are uncommon in the field because Russian knapweed reproduces mostly by creeping roots that send off new shoots. When seedlings are found look for egg- to spoon-shaped cotyledons (seed leaves) with a scaly coating on the lower surface. The first true leaves are pointed and the first several rosette leaves are football shaped to egg shaped and, in each case, are covered with a white powdery coating. Later developing rosette leaves are irregularly lobed with wavy edges. Mature plant The erect, thistle-shaped, open-branched, leafy plant is about 1 to 3 feet (30–90 cm) tall. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem and vary in shape. Upper stem leaves are narrowly lance shaped to linear, smooth edged or toothed, and 2/5 to 1-1/5 inches (1–3 cm) long. Lower leaves are 1-3/10 to 4 inches (4–10 cm) long, deeply lobed or have wavy edges. After flowering in summer, stems die back in the late fall and new shoots emerge in spring. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through September. Flower heads are produced at the ends of branches. They consist of about thirty white, pink, or lavender-blue (disk) flowers interspersed with bristles gathered above a green, somewhat spherical base with overlapping bracts (reduced leaflike structures) that look like scales. Fruits The small, 1/10 to 1/6 of an inch (3–4 mm) long, one-seeded fruit is white or pale gray, narrowly egg shaped, and attaches to a tuft of soft white bristles (pappus) that are unequal in length and fall off at maturity. Seeds Seeds are white or pale gray, narrowly egg shaped, and have a scar at the base where a tuft of bristles was formerly attached. Reproduction Reproduces mostly by shoots budding from creeping roots and less often by seed.",

Habitat Open places in managed forests, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, lawns, landscaped areas, fields, pastures, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged areas. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to nearly round, with a round to sharply lobed base, and a squared to slightly indented tip. They have smooth edges and hairy stalks. The first and subsequent leaves are somewhat hairy and broadly oval, with a lobed base, depressed veins, and rounded teeth on the edge. Mature plant Mature plants can grow to 1.3 feet (0.4 m) tall. Stems are square in cross-section and often branch near the base. Leaves are roughly 2/5 to 1 inch (1–2.5 cm) long, sparsely hairy, and broadly egg shaped or heart shaped to nearly round. Middle and upper leaves are stalkless with lobed to truncate bases, a rounded tip, and a round-toothed to weakly lobed edge. Lower leaves are on stalks. Flowers Flowers bloom from March through August. Flower clusters are arranged in whorls at the bases of upper leaves. Individual flowers are slender, reddish or purplish, tubular, two-lipped, and 1/2 to 3/4 of an inch (13–19 mm) long. Some plants are self-pollinated and have small flowers that do not open. Fruits The fruits are comprised of four nutlets contained in a tubelike structure (sepal tube). Seeds The seeds or nutlets are brown, tiny, and triangular in cross-section and have a rounded to squared tip and a long tapering base. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Horseweed, also called mare's tail, is a summer annual or biennial broadleaf plant. It is found throughout California to about 6600 feet (2000 m) and inhabits agricultural land, disturbed managed sites, and landscaped areas. It establishes in areas where the natural vegetation has been disturbed. During wet years it may be found on hillsides of coastal sage scrub. It is a strong competitor for water and grows rapidly. Habitat Ditch and canal backs, urban sites, agronomic crop fields, landscaped areas, orchards, vineyards, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval to egg shaped, hairless to densely covered with short stiff hairs, and up to 1/10 of an inch (about 3 mm) long. Leaves attach alternate to one another along the stem. The first leaf is egg shaped to football shaped and is on a hairy stalk. Later leaves are more-or-less football shaped with slightly toothed edges. Young plant Leaves grow as a rosette around a crown. Mature plant Mature plants grow erect, 6-1/2 to 10 feet (2–3 m) tall. Usually a single main stem branches out from the upper half of the plant. In hairy fleabane, the main stem usually branches near the base. However, cutting the main stem of horseweed can lead to the growth of several basal branches. An abundance of dark green leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Shorter, mowed plants may look similar to hairy fleabane, but horseweed leaves are dark green while hairy fleabane leaves are gray-green. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through September. Many flower heads grow at the ends of branched stems. Initially the flower head has an urn-shaped green base with a very small daiseylike flower (head) at the top. Eventually the flower heads mature and expand into seed heads, which look somewhat similar to dandelion puffs. Fruits Fruits are small, roughly 1/16 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, narrow, elliptical or oblong, slightly hairy, and attached to soft, dirty-white bristles. Seeds Horseweed seed bristles are mostly dirty white compared to those of hairy fleabane, which are brownish-white and often redden with age. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

With the exception of deserts and the Modoc Plateau, it is found throughout California up to an elevation of 3300 feet (1000 m). Poison-hemlock infests roadsides, ditch banks, and pastures. Sometimes it invades vineyards and orchards planted in low-lying riparian areas. It contains piperidine alkaloids and all plant parts are highly toxic to humans and animals when consumed. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are light green, narrowly lance to egg shaped, three to five times longer than broad, with prominent veins underneath. Stalks below the cotyledons are often purple-tinged. The first true leaves are smooth and deeply cut two to three times, like a parsley leaf, and attach alternate to one another along the stem. Leaf stalks of young true leaves tend to be purple-tinged as well. When leaves are crushed the plant gives off a musty odor that has been described as parsniplike. Young plant The young plant exists as a large basal rosette of leaves for the first year. Mature plant Poison-hemlock matures in July and August and grows erect up to almost 10 feet (3 m) tall. In overall outline its leaves are triangular, but are divided into leaflets that are lobed or deeply divided again. Leaf stalks usually have purple streaks or spots. Upper leaves are nearly stalkless. Crushed leaves give off a musty odor that can smell similar to parsnip. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through July. The flower head grows from the end of the flowering stem. It consists of several loose, umbrella-shaped clusters of small, white flowers. Each cluster has a stalk, 1/4 to 3/4 of an inch (0.6–1.9 cm) long. Fruits Fruits are grayish brown, egg shaped to nearly round, with longitudinal ribs. With time the fruit separate into two halves; each contains one seed. Seeds Seeds germinate in April and May, are grayish brown, and about 1/8 of an inch (0.13 cm) long and less than that in width.

In California it is found on the North Coast, Central Coast, and South Coast to about 660 feet (200 m) in turf, pastures, and other disturbed, moist sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are square to egg shaped with a base that is squared to barely lobed, and have a squared to slightly indented leaf tip. Cotyledons are opposite to one another on the stem and have a smooth surface or are covered with nipplelike projections. Leaf stalks are hairy. The first leaves are egg shaped and sparsely covered with short, thick, nipple-based hairs. Mature plant The mature plant is prostrate spreading up to 1-3/5 feet (0.5 m) in length. Stems are branched or unbranched and are square in cross-section. Leaves are egg shaped to oblong egg shaped, with a round base and rounded tips and have either smooth edges or slightly wavy to scantily toothed edges. Leaves are opposite to one another along the stem, and range from hairless to having many short hairs. Most leaves have stalks, however, upper leaves may lack stalks. Flowers Three blue-violet, lavender, pink, or rarely white flowers cluster closely in each whorl. The whorls create a dense spike flower head at the tip of the flowering stem. Scaly looking structures (bracts) below the flowers often have purple-tinged tips. Farther down, below the base of the flower head, is a pair of leaves. Fruits Fruits consist of four nutlets enclosed by the outer petal-like sepals. Seed Each seed is egg shaped, about 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long, smooth, with a rounded back, and angled front, and a base tapered to a white attachment point. Reproduction Reproduces by seed and from creeping stems that root at the joints (nodes).",

Except for non-irrigated desert regions, it is found throughout California to about 660 feet (200 m). Goosegrass is normally found in compacted areas or areas of heavy wear; it inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed places, especially those that receive some summer water, and grows close to the ground. It is a widespread and highly variable species that tolerates a broad range of environmental conditions, but does not survive frost. Goosegrass is susceptible to viruses that cause diseases such as sugar cane mosaic. Habitat Turf, landscaped areas, gardens, crop fields, orchards, roadsides, and other disturbed places. Mature plant Goosegrass forms a pale green matlike clump with flattened stems that grows in a low rosette. Stems are somewhat fleshy at the base. The mature plant can spread to about 2-1/2 feet (80 cm) wide. The leaf blades are nearly hairless, except for long hairs on the blade bases, collars, and/or upper sheath margins. Leaves are keeled along the midvein near the base of the blade. Sheaths are open, flattened, keeled, and are whitish at the base around the collar. Collar region Leaves have a short membranous ligule with a jagged top. It is usually cleft in the center. There are no auricles. Flowers Flowers bloom from July through October. Flowers cluster along stiff spikes. Usually two to six spikes radiate out at the end of the flowering stem (although one to twelve spikes may occur). Sometimes one or two spikes are attached below the terminal cluster. Fruits Seed heads are somewhat similar to those of dallisgrass, Paspalum dilatatum, but are shorter and stiffer. The Fruits are tiny, reddish brown, one seeded, and enclosed in a thin covering. Seeds Seeds are produced even when plants are closely mowed. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Tomatillo groundcherry is a summer annual broadleaf found in the San Francisco Bay region, Central Valley, Sierra Nevada foothills, Central and South Coast, South Coast Ranges, and Peninsular Ranges of California up to 2300 feet (700 m). There are many similar groundcherry species and varieties and correct identification has proven difficult. Publications have commonly confused species and varieties. Taxonomists are still working on resolving Physalis taxonomy. Tomatillo goundcherry is cultivated for its edible berries and in some areas has spread away from cultivated areas. The leaves and immature fruits of some Physalis species may be toxic when ingested. Cutleaf groundcherry, a related species, has been reported to be toxic to livestock. Habitat Tomatillo groundcherry is found in orchards, vineyards, crop fields, roadsides, fields, waste areas, and disturbed open sites. Seedling The cotyledons (seed leaves) are lance shaped and about 1/8 to 1/2 inch (3–12 mm) long and 1/25 to 1/6 inch (1–4 mm) wide. Later leaves are egg- to lance shaped, increasingly larger, and sometimes are hairy. The weak taproot is equipped with many fibrous lateral roots. Mature plant The mature plant is upright to bushy or sprawling and can grow to 3-1/3 feet (1 m) tall. Leaves are variable, hairless to slightly hairy, particularly on new growth. Leaves are somewhat egg shaped, with smooth or inconsistently toothed edges, 2/5 to 3-1/5 inches (1.5–8 cm) long. They alternate along the stem and toward the stem tips, roughly opposite to each other. The weak taproot of the seedling develops into a shallow fibrous root system. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through October and usually grow singly on flowering stems. They are bowl shaped and yellow with 5 dark purple spots at the center, have a diameter of about 1/3 to 3/5 inch (8–15 mm). Fruits The immature fruit is a green berry enclosed in a green, spherical to egg-shaped, ten-ribbed, hanging papery husk, mostly 3/5 to 1-1/3 inch (15-35 mm) long. As the fruit develops it continues to increase in size, eventually splitting the husk. Berries change in color and are usually purple at maturity. The husk eventually turns brown and the berry, filled with many seeds, disperses with the husk. Seeds Seeds are yellowish, almost round- to kidney shaped, compressed, roughly 1/12 inch (2 mm) long, with tiny pitting on the surface. Reproduction Tomatillo groundcherry reproduces by seed. Berries fall near the parent plant, but can disperse farther distances in water and with human and animal activities such as cultivation or digging. Animals can disperse seeds through their droppings after eating the berries.

Except for deserts, common groundsel is found throughout California up to an elevation of 4900 feet (1500 m). Infestations are most problematic during cool, moist periods. Plants die during extended hot and dry periods. Common groundsel contains toxic compounds called pyrrolizidine alkaloids. When ingested in large quantity, or even in small amounts over several weeks or months, they are toxic to humans and livestock. However, livestock losses caused by feeding on common groundsel are uncommon and most poisonings are due to ingestion of contaminated hay or hay cubes over a period of time. Habitat Fields, vegetable and agronomic croplands, gardens, nurseries, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas and yards, roadsides and other disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyelons (seed leaves) are narrowly football shaped to oblong, 1/10 to 2/5 of an inch (3–11 mm) long, with a rounded to somewhat pointed tip, a tapered base, and often purplish below. The first leaves are egg shaped, have edges with shallow teeth, are alternate to one another along the stem, and are about 3/10 to 1/2 of an inch (8–12 mm) long. Third and fourth leaves are more deeply lobed. Young plant Young plants remain as rosettes until maturity. Mature plant Mature common groundsel stems are more-or-less erect and the plant grows a single stem or branches from the base. It can grow up to 2 feet (60 cm) tall. Leaves are highly variable: they are hairless to lightly covered with long wavy or cotton-like hairs; upper leaves are smaller than lower leaves and attach directly to the stem (without stalks); lower leaves have short stalks. In general, leaves are deeply lobed with toothed edges and evenly spaced on the stems. Flowers Flowers bloom nearly year-round. Single, tiny, yellow flowers cluster into non-showy flower heads at the tip of the flowering stem. Green reduced leaflike structures (bracts) with conspicuous black tips hug the base of the flower head, distinguishing groundsel from others in the thistle family. The flower head eventually matures into a white puffball—a seed head similar to a dandelion seed head. Fruits Fruits are tiny, less than 1/10 of an inch (2.5 mm), cylindrical with shallow ribs, light brown, often hairy, and end in a tuft of delicate white hairs that are eventually shed. Seeds One seed is contained in each tiny fruit. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Cutleaf geranium is a freely branching annual or biennial broadleaf plant. Except for deserts and the Great Basin it is found throughout California to about 3900 feet (1200 m). Cutleaf geranium inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed locations. It remains prostrate in turf. Although widespread, it is generally a minor weed. Habitat Roadsides, fields, pastures, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, turf, disturbed open woodlands, shrublands, occasionally crop fields, other plant communities, and disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are slightly asymmetrical with a slightly lobed base and truncate, indented tips. They are about 1/5 to 1/3 of an inch (0.5–0.8 cm) long and about 1/5 to 1/2 of an inch (0.6–1.2 cm) wide. Cotyledons and their stalks are hairy, and often the hairs are glandular. Leaves are roundish in outline, lobed, and are alternate to one another along the stem. The first leaf blade is about as long as it is wide, with lobes that often have rounded tips with an abrupt, minute point. Second and later leaves look like the first, but each primary lobe has a smaller lobe on each side. Lobe tips are somewhat rounded and often have a minute point at the tip. Young plant Until the flower stem develops in the spring, the plant exists as a rosette with long-stalked leaves. Mature plant Stems grow prostrate to erect, are about 2-1/2 feet (0.8 m) long (or tall), and are hairy and rough. Stem leaves are deeply cut into narrow divisions while rosette leaves are palm shaped and deeply lobed with long stalks. Flowers Flowers bloom from March through October. Flowers have five, violet pink petals that are rounded or have a notched tip. Flower stalks are less than 1/10 to 2/5 of an inch (2–10 mm) in length. Flower stem hairs are glandular. Usually there are two flowers per cluster. Fruits Immature fruit consist of five sections of the ovary fused together plus five elongated structures above the ovary that form a column. The entire unit looks like a stork's head and beak. At maturity each seed-bearing unit (carpel) detaches from the base of the beak and rolls to its tip, exposing one to two seeds. Seed Seeds are brown, strongly pitted, and nearly round. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

    "description": "Nettleleaf goosefoot, a broadleaf plant, is among the most common summer annuals. It is found throughout California to an elevation of 5900 feet (1800 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Under certain conditions, nettleleaf goosefoot may contain toxic amounts of oxalate or nitrate compounds. Sheep and other grazing animals are affected. It is a host of viruses that affect several crops and ornamentals including cherry leafroll, beet curly top, and plum pox viruses; ringspot viruses of pepper, hibiscus, and tomato; and mosaic viruses of beet, lettuce, apple, cucumber, parsnip, radish, tomato, turnip, watermelon, hop, poplar, and primula. Habitat Roadsides, fields, pastures, agronomic and vegetable croplands, gardens, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, and disturbed, unmanaged sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are dark green, narrow and oblong to lance shaped. First leaves are similar in size to the cotyledons and appear to be opposite to one another on the stem. Later leaves are alternate to one another along the stem and are increasingly larger. Leaf edges are weakly toothed. Minute, white, dotlike scales sparsely cover the upper and especially the lower leaf surface. Stalks and the lower leaf surface are sometimes purplish red. Mature plant The mature plant grows up to 3 feet (90 cm) tall, with branches arising mostly from the base of the main stem. Leaves are usually triangular/egg shaped to lance shaped and have coarsely toothed edges with an upper dark green, glossy surface, and a lower surface that is sparsely covered with fine, white, powdery coating. Leaves have slender stalks that are roughly half as long as the leaf blade. Young leaves have a moist, dewy coating and a strong odor when crushed. Flowers Nettleleaf goosefoot blooms mostly in spring, but sometimes blooms almost year-round. Tiny, green, stalkless flowers are less than 1/10 of an inch (1.5 mm) in diameter and cluster densely into flower heads, most of which are found at the tips of the main stem and branches. Some flowers, however, arise from bases of leaves in the lower portion of the stem. Fruits The fruits are tiny, up to 1/17 of an inch (about 1.5 mm) in diameter. The outer fruit wall is difficult to separate from the seed. Seeds The seeds are disk shaped, black to dark brown, with a minutely pitted surface. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "name": "Wild garlic",
    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/WEEDS/wild_garlic.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Wild garlic is a perennial plant that primarily reproduces vegetatively by bulbils (small aerial bulbs) and bulbs. In California, it is found in central North Coast, San Francisco Bay region, lowlands of the southern North Coast Ranges, southern Klamath Ranges, Sacramento Valley and adjacent lowlands of the northern Sierra Nevada foothills, and northern Central Coast to about 330 feet (100 m). When cattle feed on wild garlic foliage, meat and dairy products derived from them can have an onion flavor. Allium species contain sulfur compounds that can destroy red blood cells if a large enough quantity is eaten. Therefore, feeding on large amounts of leaves and bulbs can lead to anemia in humans and animals. However, for grazing animals usually such a problem arises only when a large proportion of the forage is wild garlic. Wild garlic can form large colonies. The California Department of Food and Agriculture classified wild garlic as a Noxious Weed List B: Control is required in nurseries. Elsewhere, control measures are at the discretion of local County Agricultural Commissioner. Habitat Wild garlic grows in vegetable crops, vineyards, orchards, cultivated areas, and disturbed sites. It thrives in areas where summer moisture is available, especially heavy fertile soils and is tolerant to wet soil. Young plant The wild garlic sprout looks like a grass seedling, but the leaves are round and hollow. Mature plant Basal, grasslike leaves emerge from a bulb, usually forming a clump. The basal leaves are narrow, hollow, rounded, hairless, and 6 to 24 inches (15–60 cm). At maturity two plant types exist: those that produce a flowering stem and those that do not. Those that do not form the flowering stem are smaller and have narrower and fewer leaves. Flowering plants produce one round flowering stem that grows to 3-1/3 feet (1 m) tall and has 2 to 4 leaves per stem. Dense clusters of flowers and/or aerial bulbils are produced on top of the flowering stem forming the inflorescence. Leaves and bulbs have a strong garlic odor when crushed. Flowers Flowers bloom from May through July. The flower cluster (inflorescence) is half spherical or nearly spherical globe, about 4/5 to 2 inches (2–5 cm) in diameter. Typically, it is comprised of grain-sized, stalkless bulbils (small bulbs) with a few flowers on slender stalks above. The individual bulbils are egg shaped, brown to purplish brown, smooth and shiny, 1/5 inch (5 mm) in diameter and frequently grow thin green leaves while still connected to the stem. Flowers are greenish white to pink or reddish violet. A papery leaflike bract is found at the base of the inflorescence. Fruits The fruit is an egg-shaped capsule, about 1/8 to 1/6 inch (3-4 mm) long, with 3 chambers. Seeds Seeds are semicircular, flattened, dull black, about 1/8 inch (3 mm) long, wrinkly and are frequently under developed. Reproduction Wild garlic reproduces vegetatively by aerial bulbils and underground bulbets.

Yellow foxtail is found in the central-western region, Central Valley, South Coast, Mojave Desert, southwestern Great Basin east of the Sierra Nevada, and low elevations of the eastern Klamath Ranges, Cascade Range, and Sierra Nevada, up to about 3900 feet (1200 m). Green foxtail is found throughout low-lying and foothill areas of California, except in the Mojave Desert and Great Basin, to about 1000 feet (300 m). Giant foxtail, S. faberi, a species uncommon in California, is sometimes found in southeastern Sacramento Valley and the adjacent Sierra Nevada foothills, up to an elevation of 328 feet (100 m). Foxtails inhabit agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Yellow foxtail also inhabits turf. All grow in moist or dry soil and tolerate a broad range of environmental conditions. Habitat Roadsides, ditch banks, fields, pastures, cropland, orchards, vineyards, gardens, and other disturbed sites. Seedling First leaves are usually parallel to the ground. Mature plant Foxtails grow in loose clumps or sometimes singly. Stems are erect or bent at the base, but overall ascend upward. Mature foxtails range in height from 1 to 3 feet (30–90 cm) and branch at the base. Leaf blades are 4 to 15 inches (10–37.5 cm) long, and most have a spiral twist. Collar region The ligule of yellow foxtail consists of a fringe of short hairs. Auricles are lacking. There are no hairs on the leaf sheath margin below the collar as in green foxtail. If the leaf sheath of green foxtail is pulled away from the stem, you can see fine hairs on the leaf sheath below the collar region and the leaf blades are flat and lack hairs. Giant foxtail sheaths are cylindrical or slightly flattened, with hairs at the margins. Flowers Bloom times for these species are: Giant foxtail: June through November\nGreen foxtail: May through November\nYellow foxtail: June through December Flower heads are spikelike, bristly, and densely packed with flowers (florets). Giant foxtail flower heads range from about 3 to 7 inches (7–18 cm) long; yellow foxtail flower heads 7/10 to 3 inches (2–8 cm) long; and green foxtail flowerheads 7/10 to 6 inches (2–15 cm) long.

Broadleaf, E. botrys, and whitestem, E. moschatum, filaree are found throughout California, except in deserts and the Great Basin to about 3300 feet (1000 m) and 5000 feet (1500 m), respectively. Redstem filaree, E. cicutarium, is found throughout California to about 6600 feet (2000 m). These filaree species inhabit agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Habitat Roadsides, pastures, grassland, rangeland, agronomic and vegetable crop fields, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, and other open disturbed and unmanaged sites. Seedling Seedlings are hairy with either glandular or nonglandular hairs. Cotyledons (seed leaves) have long stalks. Broadleaf and redstem filaree cotyledons are egg shaped with three to four asymmetric lobes that are broadly rounded. First and subsequent leaves of broadleaf filaree are egg shaped with round-toothed to more-or-less shallow-lobed edges, whereas those of redstem filaree are deeply lobed or divided. Whitestem filaree cotyledons have five deeply asymmetric lobes. Young plant Leaves form a rosette close to the ground. Mature plant Depending on the species, stems grow from spreading to more-or-less erect and reach 2 to 3 feet (0.6–1 m) in height or length. The leaves distinguish the three species. Rosette leaves of whitestem and redstem filaree are fully divided into leaflets, but whitestem leaflets are less deeply cut than those of redstem filaree. Rosette leaves of broadleaf filaree are lobed, but not fully divided into leaflets. In addition, stems of whitestem filaree are pale and redstem filaree stems are often reddish. Flowers Flowers cluster at the top of the flowering stalk and resemble ornamental geranium flowers. Each flower has five, separate pink to reddish-lavender petals. Fruits The long and needlelike immature fruit resemble a stork's head and beak. At maturity the fruit separates into five parts, each having a tail that eventually coils as the seed matures and dries. Seeds The seed body is lance shaped and hairy with a slender attachment (style) that coils and, midway up, curves sharply to form a right angle. The coils tighten in dry conditions and loosen in humid conditions, which acts to drill the seed into the soil. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

Sharppoint fluvellin is more frequently found in the Sacramento Valley and westernmost counties than in the other areas and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. In Southern California it is primarily found as an orchard weed. Female fluvellin sporadically inhabits open, disturbed areas. These plants prefer moist, sandy soils. Habitat Roadsides, landscaped areas, orchards, gardens, crop fields, riparian areas, mudflats, and other disturbed sites. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are gray green and egg shaped. The first true leaves are egg shaped with smooth edges. Mature plant Plants branch at the base and have a matlike growth form. Stems are usually prostrate or prostrate with erect tips. Sharppoint fluvellin leaves are alternate to one another along the stem, and sometimes opposite to one another near the base of the plant. While lower leaves are egg to slightly heart shaped, some upper leaves may be arrow shaped with basal lobes that flare outward. Leaves are covered with soft hairs and some glandular hairs.

It is found throughout California to about 8500 feet (2600 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Flixweed can be fatally toxic to cattle when the flowering plants are consumed in quantity. Flixweed populations appear to be increasing in the Mojave Desert. Habitat Roadsides, fields, vineyards, orchards, agronomic crop fields, gardens, disturbed desert areas, canyon bottoms, and disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are hairless, lance to football shaped, and small, up to 1/3 of an inch (7 mm) long. The stalk below the cotyledon is usually inconspicuous and covered with minute, branched hairs. The stalk stubs remain when the cotyledons are shed. The first leaf pair often appear opposite to one another on the stem. The first leaves are stalked, have three lobes, and are covered with tiny, branched hairs. Later leaves are one or two lobed and are alternate to one another along the stem. Young plant Young plants exist as basal rosettes until the flower stem develops. Mature plant Mature flixweed can reach over 2 feet (0.8 m) tall. Stems may be branched, starting from the middle of the main stem or above, or unbranched. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem and are divided into leaflets (leaflets are either lobed or divided again). Leaves are sparsely to densely covered with tiny, branched hairs or a mixture of branched and simple hairs. The similar Sisymbrium species, tumble mustard and London rocket, have simple hairs rather than the branched hairs of flixweed. Flixweed has very finely divided leaves whose leaflets are often finely divided once or twice again. However, most Sisymbrium species have undivided, lobed leaves or leaves divided into leaflets that may be lobed, but are not divided again. Flowers Flowers bloom from March through August, depending on the region. Erect branches have long flowering stems with yellow flower clusters. Fruits Fruits consist of linear, nearly cylindrical pods, about 2/5 to 1-2/5 inches (10–35 mm) long and less than 1/25 of an inch (1 mm) wide. They are straight or slightly curved upward, with a tiny beaklike tip. Seeds There are roughly ten to twenty seeds per pod.

One feature to separate the two is that the leaves of hairy fleabane are gray green, narrower, and more crinkled than those of horseweed. Mature plant The mature plant can reach almost 4 feet (1.2 m) tall. It is well branched. Leaves are gray green and are covered with both short, stiff and long, soft hairs. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. Leaf edges range from smooth to weakly toothed or lobed. Upper leaves are linear to lance shaped. Lower leaves are generally egg shaped and taper to a short stalk. Although similar to horseweed, hairy fleabane branches more, has more basal leaves, and its stems usually branch near the base. Horseweed stems usually branch only in the upper half of the plant. Horseweed leaves only have short, stiff hairs, not a combination of short, stiff and long, soft hairs found in hairy fleabane. Fleabane typically is never over 4 feet (1.2 m) tall, but horseweed can reach over 9 feet (2.7 m) tall. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through September. Upper branches contain many flowering stalks and there is one flower head per stalk. The flower head has a green, cup-shaped base formed by green leaflike structures (bracts) that overlap. The base tapers toward the top and encloses tiny, yellow flowers (disk flowers) that are surrounded by small, cream-colored bristles. As the fruit develop the head opens up and the bristles loosen. Fruits The fruiting head looks somewhat like the “puffball” of a dandelion fruiting head but much smaller. It consists of bristle bearing seeds radiating outward, forming a fuzzy, spherical, cream-colored \"head\". Seeds Seeds are tiny, narrow, football shaped, or oblong, and approximately 1/17 of an inch (1.5 mm) long. Attached to the seed are brownish-white bristles that often redden with age. Horseweed bristles are mostly dirty white. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Horseweed, Conyza canadensis",

    "description": "Whitestem filaree is a low growing, common winter annual and sometimes biennial broadleaf. Except for deserts and the Great Basin, it is found throughout California, to about 4900 feet (1500 m). Whitestem filaree inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. It is a winter host of beet leafhopper, Circulifer tenellus, and is susceptible to the beet western yellows and soybean dwarf viruses. Habitat Roadsides, pastures, fields, grassland, rangeland, agronomic and vegetable croplands, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, open turf areas, and other open, disturbed or unmanaged sites. Seedling Seedlings may have glandular hairs or nonglandular hairs. Cotyledons (seed leaves) have five deep asymmetric lobes, and/or are fully subdivided with lateral lobes that taper to a point. They have long stalks. The first and subsequent few leaves are deeply lobed to fully divided. Young plant Leaves form a rosette close to ground. Mature plant Mature plants may reach 3-1/3 feet (1 m) and range from spreading to more or less erect over open ground. Rosette leaves are stalked, composed of egg-shaped leaflets with toothed to shallow-lobed edges. Stem leaves resemble rosette leaves; leaves are short stalked to nearly stalkless. Upper stem portions generally have glandular hairs. The three species of filaree can be distinguished by their leaves. Rosette leaves of both whitestem and redstem filaree are fully divided into leaflets. Rosette leaves of broadleaf filaree are lobed, but not fully divided into leaflets as are their stem leaves. Whitestem filaree leaflets are less deeply cut than those of redstem filaree and stems of whitestem filaree are pale, stems of redstem filaree are often reddish, and the lower stem portion of broadleaf filaree is coarsely hairy. Flowers Flowers bloom from February through May (sometimes earlier or later). Flowers cluster at the top of the flowering stalk. There are about six to thirteen flowers per cluster. Each flower has five, pink to reddish-lavender petals. Fruits The long and needlelike immature fruit resemble a stork's head and beak. At maturity the fruit separates into five parts, each having a tail that eventually coils as the seed matures and dries. Seeds The seed body is tiny, lance shaped, hairy, and brown, with a long, slender attachment (style) that coils several times in the lower portion and midway curves sharply to form a right angle. The coils tighten in dry conditions and loosen in humid conditions and this action drills the seed into the soil. Overall the entire seed structure ranges from 1 inch to over 2 inches (2.4–4.6 cm) in length. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Filarees, Erodium sp.

Tall fescue is especially invasive in coastal scrub and grassland on the North and Central Coast. It also inhabits other disturbed dry or wet areas. It is widely planted for pasture, turf, hay, and erosion control, but has escaped cultivation. New tall fescue turf cultivars may be less invasive. Sometimes tall fescue is infected with a fungus, Acremonium coenophialum. Livestock that graze on pasture infected with this fungus exhibit a wide variety of chronic health problems. Habitat Coastal scrublands, grasslands, pastures, roadsides, ditches, and other disturbed dry or wet locations. Seedling Seedling leaf blades are rolled in the bud before they open and are hairless and conspicuously veined. The collar is pale and contains a membranous ligule and auricles with hairy-edged lobes, or no lobes. Mature plant Tall fescue grows in clumps and can reach 6-1/2 feet (2 m) tall. Stems are coarse, round in cross-section, and have visible stem joints (nodes). Leaves are rolled, loosely rolled, or flat before they open from the bud. Blades are up to 2/5” (1 cm) wide, 4 to 28 inches (10–70 cm) long, dark green, slightly glossy, coarse, with rasplike edges, and radiate from a central clump. Although similar in appearance to dallisgrass, Paspalum dilatatum, tall and meadow fescues are distinguished by growing in tighter clumps, versus the loose bunches formed by dallisgrass.

    "description": "Dodder is an annual parasitic weed that grows only by penetrating tissues of host plants to obtain water and nutrients. It is found throughout California up to an elevation of 8200 feet (2500 m). Species native to California usually grow on various herbs and shrubs in most natural communities and are not considered weeds in these conditions. However, some dodder species are problematic in agricultural fields, especially alfalfa, clovers, and tomatoes. Occasionally, dodder inhabits nursery crops and landscaped sites. Although the host plant range is large, it seldom affects monocots, except for onions and asparagus. The distinctive orange, red, or yellow twining dodder shoots are unlikely to be confused with any other plant. Species identification is difficult. Seedling Dodder seedlings lack cotyledons (seed leaves) and develop a small temporary root to support a roughly 1-1/2 to 4 inch (4–10 cm) threadlike, yellow, orange, or red shoot. Depending on the species, seedlings have from about 10 days to several weeks to attach to a suitable host; otherwise they die. Mature plant Threadlike, hairless, yellow, orange, or red shoots twine around host plants eventually creating a tangled mat. Knoblike organs along the shoot (haustoria) penetrate the host stem. Shoots either lack leaves or have very tiny red, yellow, or orange scalelike leaves pressed close to the stem. Dodder lacks the usual underground roots of other plants. Once it attaches to the host, the soil connections dry up and die. Flowers Flowers bloom generally from May through October. The tiny flower petals are less than 1/4 of an inch (6 mm) long, bell-shaped, and occur in inconspicuous clusters. Fruits Fruits consist of spherical, egg-shaped, or conical capsules that are mostly less than 1/5 of an inch (5 mm) in length. Seeds Each plant produces thousands of seeds that can remain dormant in the soil for years. There are one to four seeds per capsule. Seeds are tiny, hard, spherical, oblong, egg shaped, or angular and about 1/12 of an inch (2 mm) or less in diameter. Reproduction Reproduces from seed and from stems.",

Plants may be poisonous to livestock when ingested in quantity. Habitat Ditches, roadsides, wetlands, pastures, agronomic crop fields (especially those in perennial crops like alfalfa), orchards, disturbed, unmanaged sites, and disturbed moist places. Seedling Curly dock seedlings vary in color, from entirely green to red tinged in cooler months. The succulent cotyledons (seed leaves) are three times longer than they are wide, have a somewhat rounded tip, and a stalk about as long or longer than the leaf blade. The first few leaves are egg shaped to football shaped with a rounded tip and a tapered base. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem forming a rosette. Mature plant Curly dock stands erect and grows 2 to 5 feet (0.6 to 1.5 m) tall. As a member of the buckwheat family, the plant has a characteristic membranous sheath at the leaf base and usually swollen stem joints (nodes). Leaves are hairless. Stems are often unbranched below the flower head. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem.

Mature plant Mature English daisy plants grow prostrate and reach 8 inches (about 20 cm) in length. Leaves are egg/spoon shaped with a rounded tip and form basal rosettes. Leaf and stalk surfaces are sparsely to moderately covered with soft hairs. Leaf edges are smooth to finely scalloped or toothed. Flowers Flowers bloom from March though September. Flower heads are showy. Their outer white or pinkish “petals” are actually small ray flowers and their yellow centers consist of tiny disc flowers. They grow at the top of upright, leafless stalks that are covered with stiff hairs. Fruits Fruits are one seeded and lance shaped, flattened, yellowish brown, and hairless. Reproduction English daisy reproduces from seed and from creeping, underground horizontal stems (rhizomes).",

    "description": "Dallisgrass is a perennial grass that is cultivated for pasture in many places. However, it is less commonly used for forage in California because of its weedy character. In addition, its seed heads are susceptible to an ergot fungus, Calviceps paspali, that is toxic to livestock when ingested. Its rapid growth and profuse seed production enable it to quickly invade agricultural land, especially rice, waterway margins, and managed urban sites. Except for the Great Basin and Sonoran Desert, dallisgrass is found throughout California to an elevation of 1300 feet (about 400 m). Habitat Gardens, turf, vineyards, orchards, irrigation and drainage ditches, canals, pond and reservoir margins, rice fields, and stream banks. Mature plant Dallisgrass plants form loose bunches that grow from 1 to 5 feet (about 1.5 m) tall. Plants grow from prostrate with erect tips to totally erect. The leaf sheath is somewhat flattened and its base is hairy, often tinged red, and usually inflated. The underground stems are fairly short and have areas that appear as concentric rings. Dallisgrass can be distinguished from tall fescue, Festuca arundinacea, which forms clumps rather than loose bunches. Also similar in appearance is knotgrass, Paspalum distichum, which does not have the flattened stems and hairless stem joints (nodes) of dallisgrass; rather, it has rounded stems and hairy nodes. In mowed sites, such as lawns and recreational fields, if may be confused with crabgrass but crabgrass leaves are soft whereas dallisgrass leaves are stiffer. Collar region The ligule is firm and membranous. The collar margin usually has a few spreading hairs at the edges. There are no auricles. Flowers Dallisgrass blooms from May through November. The flower head has three to six spikes that arise from different points along the stem and often droop. Although similar to the flower head of goosegrass, Eleusine indica, dallisgrass is distinguished by its longer and less stiff flower head. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.

    "description": "Dandelion is a widely distributed perennial broadleaf weed found throughout California, except in deserts, to about 11000 feet (3300 m). It consists of a complex of biotypes that vary with environmental conditions and is a common weed of mountain meadows and turf, especially in southern California. It also inhabits perennial crop fields, especially those in alfalfa, disturbed sites, and nurseries. It is a host of aster yellow disease, which affects a number of vegetable crops. Because dandelion contains high amounts of certain minerals, it serves as a complement to pasture forage for livestock. In addition to being weedy, the fine hairs of the one-seeded fruit can clog cultivation equipment. Habitat Perennial crop fields (especially alfalfa), orchards, vineyards, turf, nursery crops, pastures, and roadsides. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are oval, hairless, and have a midvein that terminates with a gland at the leaf tip. The first and next few leaves are football shaped to oblong, taper at the base, and have weakly toothed edges. Later leaves are widest near the tip with gradually tapering bases and sparsely-toothed edges. Young leaves form a basal rosette. Mature plant Dandelions have no visible stem. Leaves are sparsely hairy or hairless, with deeply serrated edges, and cluster into a rosette at the base of the plant. A strong, deep taproot exudes a milky substance when cut. Flowers Dandelions flower nearly year-round in mild climates. The bright yellow flower head is 4/5 to 1-2/5 inches (2–3.5 cm) across and is found singly on the tip of a hollow, leafless stalk that is 3 to 12 inches (7.5–30 cm) tall. The flower head consists of many, small, yellow, petal-like flowers (ray flowers). Fruits A tiny, brown, one-seeded fruit (achene) about 1/10 of an inch (3 mm) in length is attached to a long, slender stalk, terminating in a parachutelike structure (pappus) consisting of hairs. Collectively the fruit form a fuzzy, gray-white, spherical fruiting head. Seed Seeds are transported by wind. Reproduction Reproduces by seeds that can germinate almost year-round. Taproots can also send off new shoots. Related or similar plants Annual sowthistle, Sonchus oleraceus Common catsear, Hypochaeris radicata",

In California, it inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites in the southern Sacramento Valley, northern San Joaquin Valley, southwestern region, and Sonoran Desert, up to 330 feet (about 100 m). Prairie cupgrass is often mistaken for southwestern cupgrass and barnyardgrass. In open areas without competition, prairie cupgrass stems can take on a somewhat spreading growth habit. Habitat Vegetable and agronomic crop fields, fallow fields, irrigated pastures, ditch banks, roadsides, and gardens. Seedling Prairie cupgrass is distinguished from southwestern cupgrass, Eriochloa acuminata, by the soft hairs on the leaf blade and leaf sheath. Mature plant Several stems grow from the base of light grayish-green plants and stand 1 to 2 feet (30–60 cm) tall. Stem branching gives plants a bushy appearance.

    "description": "Southwestern cupgrass is a summer annual native grass that usually requires soil disturbance to establish. It is generally considered a desirable component of vegetation in natural areas but can get weedy in cultivated conditions, especially irrigated fields such as alfalfa and cotton and other disturbed, moist places. In California, it is found in the San Joaquin Valley, southwestern region, and Sonoran Desert to 660 feet (200 m) in elevation. Its seeds germinate beginning in early spring and the plant matures from June through August, producing an abundance of seed. Southwestern cupgrass can be mistaken for prairie cupgrass or barnyardgrass. Habitat Orchards, vineyards, agronomic crop fields, and other moist, disturbed sites. Seedling Southwestern cupgrass does not have soft hairs on its the leaf blade and leaf sheath as found in the prairie cupgrass, Eriochloa contracta, seedling. The southwestern cupgrass seedling has a ligule that consists of a fringe of hairs, differentiating it from barnyardgrass, which lacks a ligule. In addition, southwestern cupgrass stems are rounded and have no purpling whereas barnyardgrass stems are flattened and may be purple tinged. Mature plant Southwestern cupgrass can reach almost 4 feet (1.2 m) in height with several stems growing from the base. The stems grow upright to prostrate with upright stem tips. Leaf blades are smooth, flat, and about 1/5 to 2/5 of an inch (0.5–1 cm) wide, and about 1-1/2 to 10 inches (4–25 cm) long. Unlike prairie cupgrass, which is usually moderate to densely hairy, southwestern cupgrass is hairless to sparsely hairy. Collar region The ligule is longer and more prominent than that of praire cupgrass. Flowers Flowering takes place from June through November. The branching flower head ranges from 2 to 10 inches (5–25 cm) long. Greenish or purplish spikelets are arranged in two rows along one side of a narrow, hairy axis. Each spikelet has a dark, cuplike structure at the base, hence, its common name. Fruits The yellowish grain is oval, flat on one side, rounded on the other with a sharp point at the tip.

In California large crabgrass is found in the North Coast, southern Cascade Range foothills, Sierra Nevada foothills, Central Valley, central-western region, South Coast, and probably North Coast Ranges up to 3900 feet (1200 m) in elevation. It inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed sites. Once established, it is difficult to remove because it roots from portions of lower stems. It can provide good forage for livestock. Habitat Crop fields, orchards, vineyards, gardens, landscaped areas, turf, nurseries, pastures, roadsides, ditches, and other disturbed places. Seedling Seedlings sprout quickly. They are pale green and covered with coarse hairs. They form clumps with extensive but shallow roots where the soil is moist. Young leaves are rolled in the bud and unroll as they grow out of the center. Large crabgrass seedlings resemble those of witchgrass but are covered with shorter hairs. Mature plant Plants grow in clumps to about 2-1/2 feet (80 cm) tall, mostly upright, but sometimes prostrate. Stems are flat in cross-section, often purplish, and usually branched at the base. Leaves are flat, rolled in the bud and have a prominent midvein. It can be distinguished from smooth crabgrass, D. ischaemum, by its longer, narrower leaf, and presence of long stiff hairs on the sheath and on the upper and lower leaf surfaces. Leaves are about 1-1/4 to 8 inches (3–20 cm) long. In California smooth crabgrass is most often found in turfgrass whereas large crabgrass is more often found in gardens and landscaped areas. Collar region There is a membranous ligule but no auricles. Flowers Flowering takes place from June through October. Flowers cluster along 3 to 7 slender, fingerlike branches that are located toward the end of the flowering stem. Although similar in appearance to the flower head of bermudagrass, Cynodon dactylon, the spikelike flower branches of large crabgrass arise separately from the stem; those of bermudagrass radiate from the same point.

    "description": "White clover is a creeping perennial broadleaf plant. Except for deserts, it is found throughout California, to about 4900 feet (about 1500 m). White clover invades agricultural land and other disturbed sites. Habitat Agricultural crop fields, orchards, vineyards, forest clearings, mountain meadows, lawns and planting beds. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are small, hairless, oval to oblong, and stalked. Leaves are alternate to one another along the stem. The first leaf is simple, round to oval, often broader than long, and hairless or nearly so. True leaves consist of three leaflets. Mature plant Branching stems grow between 4 to 12 inches (10–30 cm) long, creep along the ground, and root at stem joints (nodes) producing large clumps. Leaves alternate with one another along the stem and consist of three leaflets. Each leaflet is 1/4 to 1/2 of an inch (0.6–1.2 cm) long, nearly hairless and may have a whitish crescent in the center. Although strawberry clover, Trifolium fragiferum, is similar in appearance, it does not have the whitish crescent that is often found on white clover leaflets. Flowers White clover blooms from March through December. Tiny, white to pale pink flowers cluster into spherical to slightly egg-shaped flower heads. Fruits The fruiting heads are brown and hairless and comprised of tiny linear pods. Seeds The seeds are tiny, somewhat triangular to egg shaped, and have a shallow notch at one end. They are slightly compressed and yellow to orange brown. Reproduction Reproduces by seed. Related or similar plants Strawberry clover",

It is found throughout California except in the Great Basin and non-irrigated desert areas up to 1640 feet (about 500 m). It inhabits open, often moist disturbed places in agricultural land and other areas. Ingestion of cocklebur seedlings and seeds at 1% or more of body weight can be fatal to livestock. Habitat Roadsides, ditches, valley bottomlands, pastures, cultivated crop fields, orchards, riparian areas, seasonal wetlands and disturbed, unmanaged places. Seedling Cotyledons (seed leaves) are bright green, shiny on the upper surface, pointed, and about six times longer than they are wide. The stalk below the cotyledon is short, thick, and fleshy. The first true leaves are often opposite to one another on the stem. Later leaves are alternate to one another. Both the first and next few leaf pairs are egg shaped and covered with minute hairlike projections that are rough to the touch. The bur that once contained the seed may remain attached to the base of the seedling, helping to identify the weed when it is pulled. True leaves on the seedlings are notched on the edges and taper toward the leaf tip. Mature plant Stems are thick, and may branch many times, and have purple or black spots. Leaves alternate with one another along the stem, are lobed, triangular, coarsely toothed, and have long stalks. Leaves have a distinctive scent. Flowers Flowers bloom from July through October. Clusters of small green to rusty red male flower heads develop where the upper leaf stalk meets the stem (leaf axil). Female flowers develop below the male flower heads in oval-shaped burs with short stalks. Fruits Fruits are football shaped prickly burs mostly 3/5 to 1-2/5 inches (1.5­–3.5 cm) long. The burs are green to yellowish and have a pair of beaklike hooks at the tip. Seeds Two seeds are enclosed in each bur, one larger than the other. Reproduction Reproduces by seed.",

In California upright burhead is often annual and occurs in the eastern North Coast Ranges, Central Valley, central-western region, and southwestern region, up to an elevation of about 1000 feet (300 m). It is a desirable member of natural communities, but occasionally becomes weedy in rice fields where the crop stand is thin and in other areas such as irrigation drainage canals, ponds, and stream margins. Seedling The seedling may be confused with common waterplantain, Alisma plantago-aquatica, seedlings because the cotyledons (seed leaves) of both plants float on the water's surface. However, young upright burhead plants usually grow underwater and have stalkless leaves, whereas seedling waterplantain leaves are stalked. Young plant Usually covered with water, young plants have stalkless, narrow to broadly ribbonlike leaves with wavy margins. Mature plant Plants can grow 1 to 2 feet (30–60 cm) tall. Leaves are basal to the flower stalks. Submerged leaves are stalkless and often ribbonlike while floating leaves are somewhat heart shaped at the base, blunt at the tip, and have long, angled stalks. Flowers Flowers bloom from summer through fall and consist of three, widely spaced, white petals with many ovaries in a spherical cluster. Fruits Fruiting heads are dense, egg shaped, and look like burs because of the pointy fruit on their surface. Reproduction Upright burhead reproduces mostly from seed.

It is one of the many European annual grass species that have displaced a large portion of the native grassland vegetation throughout California. Although found throughout California up to an elevation of 6600 feet (about 2000 m), it is most abundant in the central and southern parts of the state. Ripgut brome inhabits natural plant communities, open disturbed sites, and agricultural land. Brome can become established over a wide range of soil moistures. A plant residue mulch favors its buildup. It is highly flammable when dry. Habitat Open disturbed sites, roadsides, fields, rangelands, orchards, agronomic crops fields, forestry sites, and many natural plant communities. Seedling A tubular sheath distinguishes ripgut brome seedlings from most other grass seedlings. Soft hairs cover the blades and sheaths. Wild oat, which is similar, can be distinguished from ripgut brome by gently digging up the seedling and checking the base of the stem. Ripgut brome generally does not have a seed remnant at the stem’s base, but wild oat characteristically has a seed remnant that sticks to the base for a long time after germination and during growth. Flowers The open branching flower head resemble that of oats. Large spikelets with needlelike awns, 1 to 2 inches (2.5–5 cm) long, distinguishes ripgut brome from the much shorter awns of soft brome.

    "description": "Mexican brassbuttons is a low growing perennial broadleaf plant that is mostly found growing in the Cascade Range, Sacramento Valley, and the San Francisco Bay region, but is expanding its range. It mainly inhabits turf, is difficult to control there, and has the potential to become a serious weed. Generally it roots deeper than turf grasses, thrives with low clipping practices, and can exclude turf from golf courses. However, it competes poorly with taller vegetation. It spreads rapidly and is easily overlooked because of its small size. Along with other Cotula species, Mexican brassbuttons has become a “C” rated noxious weed by the California Department of Food and Agriculture. Habitat Mexican brassbuttons is found in golf course greens in the counties of Sacramento, Marin, Contra Costa, and Alameda, but can be a problem in any low-mowed turf. It has the potential to become a problem in turf nurseries. Mature plant The mature plant is small and has prostrate branching stems with short rhizomes and stolons (below and aboveground creeping stems). Leaves are feathery (dissected) and have a few hairs, except for leaves that collect at branch tips, which are hairless. Flowers Green, pale flowers cluster into flower heads called inflorescences that are about 1/12 inch (2 mm) in diameter, with a hairy base (receptacle) and short stalks that about (10 mm) long. Two similar plants, southern brassbuttons, Cotula australis, and brassbuttons, Cotula cornopifolia have non-hairy receptacles. The flowers of southern brassbuttons are yellow to white and those of brassbuttons are bright yellow. Fruits Fruit are small achenes (one seeded). Reproduction Mexican brassbuttons reproduces by seed and by rhizomes (underground) and stolons (aboveground) creeping stems.

    "description": "Roughstalk bluegrass is a cool-season perennial grass. It grows in turf and disturbed moist areas in the Sierra Nevada foothills, San Francisco Bay region, northwestern South Coast Ranges, western North Coast Ranges, North Coast, and likely elsewhere in California to about 3300 feet (1000 m). It is one of the three members in the genus Poa commonly found in turfgrass sites in California. The other two are Kentucky bluegrass, Poa pratensis, and annual bluegrass, Poa annua. Roughstalked bluegrass, P. trivialis, is a less desirable turf species that does well in moist, shaded areas but lacks heat and drought tolerance and is generally considered a weed. Habitat Roughstalk bluegrass is found in alfalfa, turf and disturbed, moist areas. Mature plant Roughstalk bluegrass grows upright to 3-1/3 feet (1 m) tall from a dense tuft of short stolons (aboveground creeping stems) at the base. Stems are slightly compressed and leaves are rolled in the bud. Flowers cluster to form an inflorescence and are arranged along open branches (panicle). Roughstalk bluegrass can be confused with Kentucky bluegrass, which is sometimes used in golf course greens, and fowl bluegrass, Poa palustris. All three grasses have cobwebby hairs at the base of the florets (individual tiny flowers). However, the sheath of roughstalk bluegrass is open 3/4 of its length, while Kentucky bluegrass sheaths are open 1/2 to 3/4 and fowl bluegrass sheaths are open more than 3/4 of their total lengths. Roughstalk bluegrass is also distinctively rougher than those of the other two species. Collar The collar is wide, distinctive, hairless, and separated at the midrib. The long, pointed ligule is membranous while that of Kentucky bluegrass is short, even, and membranous. Flowers Flowers bloom from February through March. The flower clusters (inflorescence) are found along flowering stem branches (panicle) like that of other turf bluegrasses. The overall the inflorescence form is lance to egg-shaped and about 3-1/5 to 10 inches (8–25 cm) with open branches that are spreading to ascending (rise at a slant). Like Kentucky bluegrass and fowl bluegrass, florets have a tuft of cobwebby hairs. Reproduction Roughstalk bluegrass spreads by aboveground creeping stems (stolons) and seeds.

    "description": "Most species of wild blackberry, also called brambles, are important sources of food and cover for many birds and mammals. Several species, however, are also considered weeds. Two of these are non-natives, cutleaf blackberry, Rubus laciniatus, and Himalaya blackberry, Rubus armeniacus (=R. procerus, R. discolor). Himalaya blackberry is common throughout California, except in deserts, to about 5200 feet (1600 m). Cutleaf blackberry is scattered in the Cascade Range, Sierra Nevada, San Francisco Bay region, and Penisular Ranges up to an elevation of about 6200 feet (1900 m). In addition, three native species can also be weeds under certain conditions. For example, Western thimbleberry, Rubus parviflorus, competes with conifers during establishment in reforested areas, and Pacific blackberry, Rubus ursinus (=R. vitifolius) can infest areas adjacent to streams and ditches. Western thimbleberry is found throughout California up to about 8200 feet (2500 m), except in deserts, the Central Valley, and Modoc Plateau. Pacific blackberry is common throughout California up to about 4900 feet (1500 m), except deserts and the Great Basin. These, as well as western raspberry, Rubus leucodermis, can be weedy in disturbed non-natural systems such as pastures and tree plantations. Western raspberry is found in the mountainous regions of California up to about 7800 feet (2400 m), except for the coast, deserts, and Central Valley. Of these weedy species, the most common, vigorous, and troublesome is Himalaya blackberry. Typically, first year stems grow in length. In the second year, stems produce flowers, fruits, and often have leaves with a varying numbers of leaflets. Fruiting stems usually die after they put out fruit. Mature plant Of the four weedy wild blackberries, thimbleberry is the only nonvining species. It also lacks prickly stems and has a simple leaf (no leaflets). Both Himalaya and cutleaf blackberry have five-angled stems, but Himalaya blackberry can easily be distinguished from the other wild blackberries by its five distinct leaflets, each leaflet toothed and generally oval in shape. By comparison, cutleaf blackberry has five very deeply lobed leaflets and California blackberry has only three leaflets. The majority of roots grow down to approximately 1–1/2 feet (50 cm). Some may even grow down about 6–1/2 feet (2 m) deep. Flowers Flowers have five white to pinkish petals. Bloom times for these species are: Himalaya blackberry, May through September; cutleaf blackberry, May through July; western raspberry, April through July; western thimbleberry, March through August; Pacific blackberry, March through July. Fruits The blackberry fruit is an aggregate of many, tiny, fleshy, one-seeded fruit that adhere to the fruit bearing parts. Whereas raspberries, including western thimbleberry, have fruits that separate from the fruit bearing parts, to form a cap-shaped fruit. Typically, fruits disperse to great distances by animals, particularly birds. Reproduction Wild blackberries reproduce by seed, crown and rhizome (horizontal stem) sprouts, and stem tip rooting (except western thimbleberry).",

A yellowish, tiny, hooked or curved spine is attached to the back of each lobe. Fruits Fruits remain enclosed within the dried flower. They are thin walled and have five, hooked spine lobes (one hook attached to each lobe). Seed There is one seed per fruit. Seeds are egg shaped and about 1/25 to 2/25 of an inch (1–2 mm) long.

    "description": "Hare barley, frequently called wild barley, is a winter annual grass. It is found throughout California up to 3300 feet (1000 m) and inhabits agricultural land, disturbed sites, and unmanaged natural areas. It is a useful livestock forage early in the season before the flower spikes develop. However, at maturity the spikelets have stiff, barbed, needle-like awns, and sharp bases that can injure the mouth, eyes, nasal passages, ears, and skin of animals. Habitat Annual grasslands, oak savannah, open hillsides, agronomic crop fields, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, turf, managed forests, roadsides, unmanaged, disturbed sites, and moist sites. Seedling Seedlings have hairy leaf blades like wild oat, but the empty seed coat falls off (the seed coat is held on the seedling in wild oat). Collar Ligules are papery. Unlike foxtail barley and wild oat, hare barley has well developed auricles. They are characteristically long, narrow, and clasp the stem. Mature plant The mature plant can reach over 3 feet (about 1 m) tall. Stems are round in cross-section, grow erect to somewhat spreading, and often bend abruptly at the base. Leaves are flat, rolled in the bud, are generally covered with short hairs, and often reach about 8 inches (20 cm) long. Flowers Flowers bloom from April through June. The flower head is a bristly, dense spike that is 1 to 3 inches (3–8 cm) long. At maturity, it breaks into several pieces.

    "description": "Barnyardgrass is a summer annual grass that germinates from late winter or early spring to through the summer. It is found throughout California up to 4900 feet (1500 m) and inhabits agricultural land and other disturbed areas. Barnyardgrass characteristics are highly variable from plant to plant. Habitat Disturbed moist places, roadsides, ditches, irrigated crop fields, pastures, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, and margins of ponds and rice fields. Seedling The seedling stem and leaf blades resemble those of the mature plant. The leaves are rolled in the bud, blades are flat, and the base of the seedling is tinged maroon. Young plant Stems often grow outward along the ground before turning upward. Collar Barnyardgrass does not have a ligule or an auricle. It is the only common summer grass with no hairs or membranes at the collar. Mature plant Mature plants grow up to 5 feet (1.5 m) tall and are highly variable in appearance. Stems are flattened near the base. Leaf blades are flat, rolled in the bud, and the upper surface is usually hairless. The leaf sheath is usually open and more-or-less flattened. Barnyardgrass is closely related to junglerice and looks similar, except it does not have the distinctive purple bands of junglerice leaves. It also looks similar to late watergrass a plant that is generally only is found in rice fields. Flowers Flowers bloom from June through October. They range from 2-1/2 to 10 inch (6.4–25.4 cm) long and consist of branches densely clustered with knotlike flowers. Upper branches are stiff and stand erect to somewhat erect from the flowering stem. Lower branches spread farther apart than the upper branches. The flower head is held erect or droops and is sometimes purplish. Related or similar plants Junglerice, Echinochloa colona\nLate watergrass, Echinochloa oryzicola",

    "description": "Foxtail barley is a widely distributed native cool season perennial or annual grass that is found throughout California up to an elevation of 9800 feet (3000 m). It is occasionally weedy on agricultural land and other disturbed, often moist places. Foxtail barley is susceptible to the same fungal pathogens that cause black stem rust of grains and wheat rust. Habitat Fields, pastures, ditchbanks, roadsides, saline and alkaline areas, and other disturbed, often moist sites. Collar Ligules are membranous, and unlike hare barley, auricles are absent or are poorly developed. Mature plant The mature plant can reach almost 2 feet (60 cm) tall. Leaf blades are 1 to 6 inches (2.5–15 cm) long. Flowers The flowering head is a spike that ranges from 1-1/5 to 4 inches (3–10 cm) in length. Long needlelike awns, up to 1/3 of an inch (7 mm), extend from the spike, earning the plant some of its common names such as \"skunktail\" and squirreltail\".
