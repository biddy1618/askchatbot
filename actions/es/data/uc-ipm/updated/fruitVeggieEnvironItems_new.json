Frost occurring from petal fall to when fruit are about 0.33 inch in diameter may cause internal freezing of the fruit. Externally there may be no symptoms, but as the fruit matures it becomes flattened or distorted by development of internal pockets of dead tissue. On occasion, internally damaged fruit drop from trees a week or two after injury. ",

As a general rule, nitrogen should be applied annually, usually during the growing season. To improve fruit quality and color, nitrogen levels should be low but not deficient as the harvest nears. Nitrogen fertilizer can be applied in the spring or split between spring and just after harvest. Excessive nitrogen can cause softer fruit, poor fruit color, and reduced storage and shelf life; it can also increase problems with numerous pests. Typically, mature trees should receive about 3 - 5 pounds of ammonium sulfate per year or 2 pounds of urea per year depending upon soil fertility and local growing conditions. Apply well away from the trunk and water thoroughly after application. Zinc is also commonly deficient. Affected trees have small new leaves. This deficiency is best corrected by spray applications. Spray with a \"chelated zinc\" during the growing season. Repeat if new growth still shows deficiency symptoms.",

Moderately thin out the small fruiting wood throughout the tree by making small cuts in limbs about 1 inch in diameter. The natural appearance of the walnut tree is best maintained by making only thinning cuts--cuts close to and parallel with the parent limbs or next to a lateral limb. Do not leave any branch stubs.

Once hulled, rinse the shells with water to remove the surface tannins that may stain the shell. Spread the hulled nuts out to complete the drying of the kernel inside. To determine if the kernels are dry enough for storing, shell and try to break the kernel in half. If the kernel snaps cleanly rather than bending, the nuts are ready. For best long-term storage, freeze hulled nuts for 48 hours and then seal in airtight containers or plastic bags. This will kill any insect pests and their eggs and prevent loss during storage.

For spur-pruned varieties, a bilateral cordon method works well. For cane-pruned varieties, a head-trained method is suitable. In the Pacific Northwest, the 4-cane kniffen trellis system is often used for cane-pruned varieties. The difference in pruning techniques is due to variability in fruitfulness. Cane-pruned varieties bear fruit further out on the cane, on buds numbered 4 to 12. Examples of cane-pruned varieties are 'Thompson Seedless' and 'Concord'. Spur-pruned varieties are much more fruitful and by being pruned back to a two-bud spur the vine is prevented from overcropping. For spur-pruned varieties such as 'Flame Seedless', 'Ribier', or 'Tokay', one would typically leave between 12 and 14 spur positions, depending on vine vigor. For cane varieties, leave between four and eight canes, again depending upon vigor. The more vigorous the vine, the more spurs or canes you can leave. ",

        "description": "Blackberries should be trellised as soon as the canes are long enough to reach the middle wire. Early trellising will increase fruit production. Trellis systems need to be sturdy in their construction. They should be at least 4.5 feet high with the first wire about 1.5 feet from the ground and the second wire 1 foot above the first. If rows are longer than 6 feet, support for the middle of the row will be necessary to support the wires firmly. New canes can sunburn easily if left on the ground too long. Put up only the larger canes, called primocanes, and prune out the smaller ones. Small canes only produce small fruit. If your plants are spaced 3 feet apart, leave up to nine good canes per plant. Place the long canes in a fan shape to spread out the canes. The canes should be 6 - 8 feet long. Put them over the top wire, wrap once around the middle wire and then remove the tip. Tipping or removing the ends of the canes forces out the laterals on which fruit will be borne the following season. A cane that is not tipped will continue to grow. The farther the berries are from the crown of the plant, the smaller they will be. For raspberries (see diagram), during mid- to late summer, tie new vigorous canes to the top wire, leaving the lower two wires on the ground. Let the canes grow through fall and winter. During the following May, reattach the lower training wire and gather up the canes inside the training wire. By August, new canes will be growing up though the center of the fruiting canes. Remove the canes that have fruited and again tie up the new canes onto the top wire. ",

Remove the old plants when the new ones are established. If rotating with other planting locations in your garden, it is best to avoid following crop plants that are susceptible to Verticillium wilt, such as tomato, potato, eggplant, and cucurbit. Sweet corn is a good garden rotation for strawberries. If you allow a planting bed to lie dormant between strawberry plantings, plant ryegrass to reduce levels of Verticillium and to keep other disease organisms from building up. Remove old strawberry plants in late summer. Plant a winter crop of cauliflower, cabbage, or another crucifer. In spring, spread all crop residue from the crucifer over the planting area, allow it to dry and rototill it in. Solarize the soil in summer.

Pruning during the summer can control vigorous shoot growth. To prune mature trees, cut out dead wood, thin out crowded or crossing branches, and remove limbs that are lower than desired. Moderately thin out the small fruiting wood throughout the tree by making small cuts in limbs about 1 inch in diameter. The natural appearance of the walnut tree is best maintained by making only thinning cuts--cuts close to and parallel with the parent limbs or next to a lateral limb. Do not leave any branch stubs. Do not cut branches that are larger than 4 inches in diameter because large wounds are slow to close and may be an entrance point for fungi.",

Before you put down plastic mulch, check the beds at least once a week and remove all weeds that appear. Once mulch is in place, you will have a hard time dealing with weeds that emerge under it. Stretch the plastic (1.5 mil [0.038 mm] plastic is recommended) lengthwise over the bed and pull it down on the sides of raised beds, securing it with pins or soil. Cover as much of the soil surface as possible and secure the edges of the plastic with bricks, stones, or a layer of soil to keep the mulch in place. Then cut an X about 4 inches long in the plastic over each plant, pull the plant through, and push the corners of plastic back under the plant.

        "description": "Berries require a lot of water but can be damaged by standing water on the soil surface, especially in early spring. Irrigation is usually required, with the frequency depending upon the soil texture and climate. Moisture is critical when fruit is ripening and also when flower buds form. Avoid overhead watering during the ripening stage because it may encourage fruit rot. When there is no rainfall, berries need about 1 inch of water per week. In warm climate areas, irrigate every 7 to 10 days in summer with light irrigations every 3 to 4 days during the harvest period. In coastal regions, only 3 to 4 irrigations may be required up to harvest. Continue to irrigate after the harvest to ensure the development of new canes. Irrigation tips Overhead irrigation is not recommended because it promotes fruit rot and leaf rust and other disease problems. The best irrigation systems are minisprinklers or double drip lines that have numerou emitters that wet an entire band underneath the foliage. Keep the plants moist at all times without soaking and rotting the roots. A trickle hose may also work well. ",

        "description": "Long summer days, cool nights, and a mostly dry season are ideal conditions for growing fruit trees. Fruit trees require freezing or close to freezing temperatures during the winter, but generally need at least 150 days between the last spring frost and the first fall frost so that blossoms are not damaged in spring and so that the fruit will mature in the fall. Do not plant in low spots or areas that flood frequently. If you are planting on a site where the soil is shallow because of a hardpan, break through the hardpan when preparing for planting. Do not plant trees too close together, as this may cause poor growth. Most fruit trees do best in areas with full sun, good air movement, and well-drained soils at least 4 feet deep. Apples and pears do best in soils at least 6 feet deep. Plant in unshaded areas as much as possible to prevent diseases. The best soils are fertile, slightly acidic sandy loam soils free of alkali or salinity. Avoid sandy, high clay, or shallow soils, although pears can tolerate clay or wet soils better than other fruit trees can. Cherries, peaches, and nectarines cannot tolerate soils without drainage whether from hardpans, claypans, or saturated soil conditions. Chilling hours are defined as the number of hours that the temperature is below 45\u00b0 F. It is important to make sure that your area has adequate chilling hours because inadequate chilling will result in delayed foliation and uneven fruit development. Apples are best adapted to areas with adequate chilling hours for most varieties--1,200 to 1,500 hours below 45\u00b0 F to fully satisfy the chilling requirement. However, some varieties will produce with less. In areas with a maritime climate, choose low-chill varieties. Pears are best adapted to areas with adequate chilling hours for most varieties--600 to 800 hours below 45\u00b0 F to fully satisfy the chilling requirement. Apricots are best adapted to areas with adequate chilling, which for apricots is 600 to 900 hours below 45\u00b0 F. There are a few low-chill varieties that will bear with only 350 hours. Because of the early blooming habit of apricots, avoid planting where late spring frost occurs to avoid light crops. High temperatures also influence the quality of fruit. In areas of high rainfall, apricots do not regularly set fruit and are subject to many diseases. Cherries have a fairly narrow range of adaptability, however they are very popular home-grown trees and can be found in most growing areas in California. For optimum production they require moderate summer temperatures because in high summer temperature areas, the fruit tend to double or spur. Cherries will not be productive in foggy coastal areas because of disease problems. Cherries require between 800 and 1,200 chilling hours. They bloom late so tend to be less injured by late frosts. Peaches and nectarines are best adapted to areas with 600 chilling hours for low-chill varieties to 900 for higher chilling varieties. Late frosts can also damage newly developing flowers and fruit, as peaches and nectarines bloom early. Adequate heat is required in the summer to ripen fruit properly. Cool, wet climates are not typically good for growing high-quality peaches and nectarines. For plums and prunes, there are low-chill varieties including the interspecific hybrids (crosses between apricots and plums) that will tolerate warmer conditions. Japanese plums require from 500 to 900 chilling hours and European plums require 700 to 1,000 chilling hours to satisfy the chilling requirement.",

For most apples, the ground color (or the part of the apple that doesn't turn red on red varieties) changes from a bright to a lighter green color. Color does not always indicate maturity, especially in warm climates. Tasting the fruit may be the best method of determining ripeness. It should be sweet and juicy, yet somewhat firm. Apples that are not mature will taste sour and have a coarse texture. In some varieties, seeds may turn brown when the fruit is mature. Mature fruit can be picked or left on the tree for a few more days. However, do not leave mature fruit on the tree too long or it will not store well. To harvest, lift fruit with a slight upward motion to see if the fruit is ready to be picked. Fruit should snap off easily. Do not pull the stem from the apple. Put apples under refrigeration quickly after harvesting for best storage life. Check your variety to see how long, apples can be stored. Follow recommended harvest and storage procedures for each variety of apple. Keep fallen fruit cleaned up to avoid overwintering pests. ",

Irrigating every 2 to 3 weeks is usually adequate under good soil conditions and moderate climate. Grapes may require more frequent irrigation in very hot climates in inland valleys. Drip irrigation is an excellent method of watering. Generally, a fully trellised vine on a hot summer day in the Central Valley of California will require about 8 to10 gallons of water per day with drip irrigation. Vines tha t are less vigorous or untrellised will require 6 to 8 gallons per day. In Southern California, the rates should be similar to those of Central Valley climates. In areas along the coast, and in northern parts of California, the rates will be much lower. ",

However, depending upon your soil type, this amount may be divided up into several applications. Ideally, in hot summer climate zones, you may want to irrigate about every 7 to 10 days during the middle of the summer. You may irrigate your trees using a drip system with either two to four emitters per tree or using small microspray emitters. The root zone of citrus is shallow and drippers need to be placed at the base of the trunk of newly planted trees to keep the root ball moist until roots grow into the native soil.

These deficiencies can be corrected by applying a foliar application of a liquid chelated micronutrient solution as the new growth emerges in the spring. You can also apply micronutrients in the sulfated form, such as zinc sulfate or iron sulfate, to the soil. Most mature citrus require regular fertilization with nitrogen. Typically, most other nutrients are available in sufficient amounts in the soil. Nitrogen should be applied in January or February just prior to bloom. The second application then can be applied in May and perhaps a third in June. Avoid late-season fertilization as it may affect fruit quality, delay fruit coloring, and make the rind rough. Dwarf plants or trees in containers with restricted root space may require less fertilizer. Maintaining a good fertilizing program can help preserve a tree's natural resistance to fungal diseases such as oak root fungus.

Most apple trees are trained to the central leader system or modified leader system with the development of tiers radiating out from the leader. It is important to remember to have the widest tiers at the bottom and smaller, narrower tiers at the top to avoid shading the lower limbs. Pears are best trained to an open center, vase or modified vase system. Because pears are highly susceptible to fire blight, some leaders may be killed by the disease. A multiple leader system will ensure that there are replacement scaffolds present to retain fruitfulness if some are killed out by the disease. Proper tree training also can help prevent disorders such as sunburn. Apples and pears are well suited to many other training systems, including modified lorette, cordon, and espalier.

        "identification": "Plants of tropical and subtropical origin are most susceptible to chilling injury. African violet, avocado, banana, mango, okra, princess flower (Tibouchina urvilleana), tomato, and certain others can be damaged by temperatures above freezing. To help diagnose chilling as the cause of injury, learn the low-temperature tolerance of the plants grown and whether temperatures colder than plants tolerate recently occurred in the area. Many plant species can be injured by a rapid, substantial drop in temperatures. The duration of cold, minimum temperature, rate at which temperatures drop, time of year, and plant characteristics (e.g., age, hydration, part affected) influence the occurrence and severity of cold damage.",
        "damage": "Chilling commonly kills flowers, injures fruit, and causes leaves and shoots to wilt or discolor purplish to red. Other symptoms of chilling damage can resemble those observed in more cold-hardy plants after exposure to freezing or frost (\u2264 32\u00b0F).",

For information on plants\u2019 tolerance to cold, consult the California Master Gardener Handbook and the Sunset Western Garden Book. Compare the cold tolerance of the species you wish to grow to the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map, which presents the historical, minimum temperatures at your location. To increase a soil's ability to absorb heat and warm plants, control weeds and during winter rake away mulch and keep soil bare around cold-sensitive plants. Irrigate dry topsoil at least 3 days before cold weather is expected; this increases the soil's ability to retain heat. Cover sensitive plants overnight with cloth or similar material other than plastic to reduce heat loss to the atmosphere, but leave covers open at their bottom so heat from soil can help warm plants.

        "description": "Aeration is the process of air passage though pore spaces in soil to provide an adequate supply of oxygen. Because roots require oxygen for growth and the uptake of nutrients and water, insufficient oxygen in the root zone (aeration deficit, sometimes called waterlogging) results in root asphyxiation and is a serious, often life-threatening problem for plants. Insufficient soil oxygen, excess soil moisture, and root decay pathogens often act in combination to damage or kill plants.",
        "identification": "A short-term (acute) aeration deficit (for hours to days) commonly causes wilting and premature leaf drop. Sometimes the entire plant dies. Chronic aeration deficit (for weeks to months) kills roots, stunts growth, causes abnormally short shoots and small leaves, and may lead to the gradual decline and death of plants. Leaves can suddenly collapse and turn brown and branches may die back from the tips, although only a few branches or one limb may die. In some plants, chronic aeration deficit causes stem or bark cankers, resinous or gummy exudate on bark, adventitious (atypical, not normally present) roots near the basal stem, or unusually abundant and large lenticels (corky pores, or rows of narrow openings) in bark. To diagnose aeration deficit, examine soil and roots and suspect aeration deficit if Soil or roots smell like rotten eggs. Soil is bluish gray or black and roots appear discolored, rotted, or water-soaked. Water ponds (accumulates) on the soil surface or drains slowly (e.g., topsoil remains soggy). ",
        "damage": "",
        "disorder_development": "Aeration deficit is especially common in irrigated landscapes. Excess soil moisture (waterlogging) prevents adequate aeration by impeding oxygen movement through soil and leaving few water-free pore spaces for oxygen to occupy. Irrigating too frequently or applying excess amounts of water, especially when drainage is poor (slow), is the most common cause of aeration deficit. Compaction, flooding, hardpan (an impermeable soil layer), insufficient soil volume for root growth, poor soil structure and texture, a shallow water table, and surface barriers such as pavement are other common causes of insufficient oxygen for roots. Planting in too deep of a hole, especially in poorly drained soil when the hole is backfilled with amended soil, can cause aeration deficit.",
        "solutions": "To determine the cause of aeration deficit, assess drainage, check soil moisture, determine whether the grade has been changed, and especially evaluate irrigation practices. Send soil samples to a diagnostic laboratory to determine soil texture and whether excess sodium is present; movement of air and water are restricted in sodic soils. Consider measuring soil bulk density, a soil's weight per volume, by core sampling or carefully excavating specific volumes of soil, then thoroughly oven-drying and weighing them. Bulk density higher than critical levels for that soil texture as determined from published tables indicates that soil is compacted and lacks sufficient porosity for good plant growth. A percolation test measures soil drainage (infiltration rate), which is one indicator of aeration. Prevent aeration deficit through good site preparation, appropriate planting, and proper cultural practices. If periodic soil saturation is unavoidable, consider replacing flood-sensitive plants with species more tolerant of wet soils; certain plant species tolerate very low soil aeration or tolerate it during dormancy. For more information, consult publications such as Abiotic Disorders of Landscape Plants and \"Soil and Fertilizer Management\" in the California Master Gardener Handbook. ",

Damage is more likely the longer plants are exposed to excess heat and if they are moisture stressed, otherwise unhealthy, young, or a species more susceptible to high temperatures.",
        "identification": "Similar damage is caused by aeration deficit, cold temperatures, exposure to herbicide or other phytotoxic chemicals, mechanical or gas injury to roots, root-disease pathogens, severe fire blight, and acute water deficit. Fire is the most common cause of thermal injury. Fire injury can be diagnosed because it blackens bark in addition to scorching foliage. Usually the fire event itself was observed and reported. Often it is apparent that fire was the cause based on surrounding damage: one-sided injury along edges and distinct boundaries to the burn zone. Steam or heat released by equipment, vents, and blacktop paving sometimes causes thermal injury to foliage. Usually there is an observable pattern to the damage and the injury develops over a relatively short-time period. Often the source of heat is apparent, and damage is most severe closest to the heat source. Root injury can occur at soil temperatures above 105\u00baF. Root injury from heat is common in plant containers exposed to direct sun, but it is uncommon in landscapes because of the insulating effect of soil; exceptions include unshaded raised beds or when roots are near buried heat or steam pipes, usually when the pipes leak. In new plantings where soil has been overly amended with undecomposed organic matter, roots can be killed because organic matter decomposition by microorganisms can generate substantial heat; this level of heat is common in compost piles.",
        "damage": "High temperatures can cause brown, crisp foliage that appears scorched. Additionally, fire blackens bark and leaves. Trunk damage may not be seen immediately, but heat-damaged bark will separate from the underlying wood. As the trunk expands and callus develops, bark sloughs off, exposing the wood. Thermal injury can kill plants, most commonly after a fire.",
        "disorder_development": "",
        "solutions": "To avoid high-temperature injury to roots, plant properly, provide sufficient soil volume for root growth as plants mature, and irrigate adequately. Apply organic mulch on top of the soil. Shade the sides of containers and planting boxes. Avoid planting near heat sources and choose species well adapted to local conditions. For example, giant sequoia, Monterey pine, and other species adapted to cool growing conditions become damaged or killed when planted where summers are hot, as in most inland valleys of California. Before mixing organic matter into soil, compost it well. If topsoil is amended with undecomposed organic matter at more than about 20% of topsoil volume, do not plant in it until after soil has been moist and warm for 2 months or longer to provide time for decomposition.

Wind injury to fruit skins, such as abrading with twigs, can be confused with damage from other abiotic (environmental) causes, scab fungi, or feeding by thrips or certain other insects. Damage to blossoms can resemble that caused by blight fungi, old age (overmature blossoms), and rough handling. Wind breakage of limbs can cause plants to develop a highly \"sculptured\" structure.

Especially during low humidity and cold or hot weather, high winds cause bark and foliage to desiccate (dry out).",
        "solutions": "Provide plants with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation, to reduce the adverse effects of wind. If needed during their first year of growth, stake plants properly to allow young trunks to flex and develop strength. Insect pests and disease can render a tree susceptible to wind damage, weakening scaffolds or rotting the structural wood. Proper pruning and training of young trees, and controlling wood-damaging diseases and insects, will help prevent wind damage. Create a windbreak to help shelter plants. Planting several trees clumped together may lessen their damage at windy sites. Plant susceptible species in more sheltered locations, and choose species carefully for windy sites. Plants that grow fast, become tall, and have broad, thin leaves are usually less tolerant of wind. Smaller plants and those with narrow leaves with a thicker cuticle better tolerate wind. For lists of wind-sensitive and -tolerant plants, consult publications such as Abiotic Disorders of Landscape Plants. ",

        "description": "Improper water management is probably the biggest cause of poor performance and survival of trees and shrubs. Too much or too little soil moisture damages or kills plants and favors many pest problems. Overwatering (watering too frequently or applying excessive amounts during an irrigation) is especially common in established landscapes. Underwatering of the root balls is common in new plantings, which are shallowly rooted and dry out quickly between waterings.",
        "identification": "Almost every aspect of plant growth and development can be affected by inappropriate water. Water deficit. Insufficient soil moisture causes leaves to droop, yellow, wilt, or drop prematurely. Marginal necrosis in leaves is a common symptom from water deficit. Severe, prolonged water stress causes shoot and branch dieback and, in some cases, bark cracking and trunk bleeding. Sunburn, branch and trunk cankers, and overall slow plant growth can be due to insufficient soil moisture. Water deficiency promotes certain pests. Mites, certain leaf-sucking insects, and most wood-boring insects including bark beetles, flatheaded and longhorned beetles, and clearwing moths cause more damage to plants stressed from drought; once trees become severely infested by borers, they decline and usually die. The Botryosphaeria fungus commonly causes cankers and branch dieback on drought-stressed giant sequoia. Excess soil moisture. Overwatering and excess soil moisture excludes from soil the oxygen that roots need to survive. Aeration deficit, sometimes called waterlogging, is a serious, often life-threatening problem for plants. Root decay pathogens such as Dematophora and Phytophthora spp. are present in many soils, yet usually become damaging only when excessively wet soil conditions favor them. Excessive water uptake can cause trunk splitting in palms and bark splitting in certain trees (e.g., \u00d7 Chitalpa tashkentensis). Water placement. Water dripping, ponding, or spraying near the basal trunk and soggy soil around the root collar are primary causes of root and crown diseases. Wetting areas where there are no desirable plants encourages germination of weed seeds. Splashing water spreads fungal spores and wets foliage, promoting foliar and fruit diseases such as anthracnose, brown rot, leaf spots, and rusts. Seasonal timing. The seasonal timing of irrigation is important in disease development. For example, oak root fungus, Armillaria mellea, is present on dead or living roots in many soils and becomes active when soils are warm and moist. Native oaks and many other woody species are susceptible to the disease but usually are not damaged in California, where soils normally dry out as they warm during summer. However, when people water native oaks frequently during the summer or alter soils, moist roots and warm soils coincide, predisposing oaks and many other species to infection and death by Armillaria.",

Supplemental irrigation may also be appropriate if drought-adapted trees have been injured (e.g., by cutting roots) or soil moisture has been altered from historical levels (e.g., changes in drainage) and after consecutive years of abnormally low precipitation. For California native oaks and other species adapted to summer drought, irrigation should simulate natural patterns and be applied mostly during the normal rainy season (late fall to early spring), tapering off during the dry season. Exceptions where summer watering may be warranted include planted oaks, which may be adapted to summer irrigation from the start, and in certain situations where soils have been disturbed. Be aware that certain eucalyptus and non-native oaks are not adapted to summer drought and require more frequent irrigation when planted in California. ",

        "description": "Sunburn is damage to bark, foliage, fruit, and other aboveground plant parts caused by excessive exposure to solar radiation. Sunburn injury to bark increases tree susceptible to wood-boring pests and contributes to tree decline and premature death. Sunburn is usually associated with warm weather and often with insufficient soil moisture availability. Sunburn is common in new plantings that lack a well-developed root system. Restricted soil volumes, inappropriate soil moisture, or anything that makes roots unhealthy or prevents plants from absorbing adequate water may contribute to sunburn. Even in soil that is saturated with water, sunburn may occur. Sunburn often occurs on the stems or trunks of young woody plants. Their bark is thin, and they may not tolerate being exposed to direct sun in landscapes, especially if they were grown close together in nurseries where their trunks were shaded. Older trees can be damaged when bark is newly exposed to the sun because of pruning or premature leaf drop. Removing structures or trees that provided shade or adding pavement or structures that reflect light or radiate heat around established plants can also lead to sunburn.",
        "identification": "Usually sunburn injury is most severe, or present only, on the south and west sides of plants and on the upper side of horizontal branches that are not adequately shaded. Sunscald, certain canker disease pathogens, water deficit, and certain other disorders can cause bark damage that resembles sunburn. Sunburned bark may discolor, and if the injury is recent it may ooze sap. As affected tissue dries, it becomes cracked or sunken, bark may peel away, and the wood may be attacked by boring insects and decay fungi. Sunburned trunks and limbs can become cankered or girdled and killed. Sunburned broadleaf foliage may appear glazed (abnormally shiny), silvery, or reddish brown and may progress to necrosis beginning at leaf tips, margins, and between veins. Sunburned conifer needles turn black or brown or drop prematurely.",

        "solutions": "Plant where roots will have adequate soil volume and sufficient growing space as they mature. Choose plants that are well adapted to the local environment, plant properly, and provide appropriate cultural care. Avoid anything that damages roots or prevents them from absorbing sufficient nutrients or water, including irrigating too frequently. Encourage desired branch structure by properly pruning and training plants while they are young. Retain some temporary lower branches that help shade the trunk, avoid pruning during summer, and avoid pruning off more than about 20% of the plant canopy during any one year. Apply and maintain appropriate mulch to conserve soil moisture and reduce soil temperatures during summer. Minimize changes to a plant's environment unless deliberately done to improve conditions. Whitewashing trunks helps to prevent sunburn. Apply white interior (not exterior) latex paint, diluted with an equal portion of water, to the trunks of young trees and to older bark newly exposed to the sun if it is susceptible to sunburn. Interior water-based paints for whitewash are safer to trees than oil- and water-based exterior paint. Where appropriate, modify the site to provide partial shade and prevent sunburn. If leaves have not already been killed, sunburn injury to foliage can often be remedied by adequate irrigation, adding shade or shelter, and improving soil conditions.",

Loam soils generally provide the best combination of available water and adequate oxygen for roots. Loam soils are those with roughly equal proportions of clay, sand, and silt that are not compacted. This provides a wide range of pore sizes, with the smaller pores holding moisture while the larger pores drain and allow air to enter the soil.

It may be necessary to break up or penetrate hardpan, for example with a backhoe, to provide greater soil depth. Install drain pipe, drain tile, or a sump if needed to ensure adequate drainage and good plant growth. Aeration tubes, however, have not been shown to be effective in increasing soil aeration in the root zone. Before planting, mark out a planting area that is at least two to three times the diameter of the root ball. Rototill, shovel, bore, or use an auger to mix the soil within this area to the depth of the plant's root ball. Mix the soil well. Adding organic matter to the planting hole of trees and large shrubs has not shown consistent benefits. Amending the entire potential root zone of trees is generally not practical, and amending soils around established plants will damage roots. Amendments can help before planting certain shrubs such as camellias or azaleas, which are adapted to well-drained acidic soils and will do poorly without amendment. If added, organic matter should be well composted and constitute no more that about 25% of the soil volume in the upper 12 inches of the soil. Mix it well into the topsoil. A 2- to 3-inch layer of mulch also can be added to the surface after planting. Provide adequate drainage before planting. One method is to create a sump by augering one or more holes, each 1 to 4 inches in diameter, through impermeable soil or hardpan.

        "solutions": "Consider tree preservation during the planning stage of development projects. For help consult a tree-care professional, such as an arborist who is certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or registered with the American Society of Consulting Arborists. Check city or county ordinances before working around mature trees as they may be publicly owned or protected by ordinances. How to Protect Trees. Fence off individual trees or groups of trees around the drip line or beyond to provide protection zones that prevent equipment and activities from damaging roots and trunks and compacting the soil near trees. Most roots are near the soil surface and many extend much farther than the tree canopy spread. If soil must be driven on or temporarily used to store heavy materials, apply and maintain a 6-inch-thick layer of coarse, organic mulch to reduce soil compaction. Minimize changes in soil grade and drainage; compaction and changes in soil contour alter surface and subsurface water flow on which established vegetation may depend. If roots have been crushed or cut, monitor the root zone in the undisturbed area and ensure that the soil is appropriately irrigated. Use engineered soil mixes. In areas that will include both landscape and paving, such as commercial parking lots where shade trees will be planted, consider using special, structural, soil mixes. These engineered mixes can be compacted to the density required to ensure pavement integrity while still providing the air- and water-holding properties vital for root growth and health. Do not place fill around trunks. If the grade must be elevated, construct a stone or concrete well around each trunk. Before placing the fill, installing a drainage system on top of the existing soil may help provide oxygen and appropriate water to established roots once the original soil level is covered. If the grade must be lowered, construct retaining walls to preserve as much of the original grade, roots, and soil as possible, at least within the drip line of established trees. If soil is undisturbed on one side and adequate cultural care is provided, a tree may survive if soil on the other side is removed no closer to the trunk than about halfway between the trunk and drip line. If the grade must be lowered near trunks, consider removing the trees as they are likely to become diseased and hazardous and die prematurely. Assess the situation. Be realistic in assessing which trees are worth saving and likely to survive construction. When large roots are cut or injured, the tree becomes more likely to be blown over by wind, especially if the soil is wet. Remove declining or severely injured trees rather than leaving them to become a hazardous and expensive problem after sites are occupied; trees can be left to protect other trees during construction, then removed soon afterward. Consider removing trees if the drainage, root zone, or soil grade will be seriously disturbed or if species with incompatible cultural needs will be planted nearby, such as planting frequently irrigated turfgrass near native oaks. Protect roots. Avoid crushing or cutting roots, especially those larger than about 2 inches in diameter. Trench for utilities away from roots, combine utilities in a single trench, and tunnel beneath roots instead of cutting them. Instead of digging around roots, use hydroexcavation or pneumatic excavation (e.g., Air Knife or Air Spade) that remove soil but leave roots intact. Locate septic systems away from trees. Chemicals used in septic systems may leach and damage roots or roots may grow into the systems and cause damage. Use partially permeable materials (e.g., bricks instead of concrete) if extensive areas near trunks must be paved. Use caution when applying wood preservatives; they may kill nearby vegetation through direct contact or by leaching. Landscape thoughtfully. Be aware of fire hazards from natural or planted vegetation around buildings. Use good judgment by planting species with compatible water requirements in an existing landscape.

Some \u201csmart\u201d irrigation controllers use on-site, soil-moisture sensors or weather-dependent, evapotranspiration (ET) data to automatically adjust the watering schedule. For more information, see Conserve Water in Landscapes, Estimating Irrigation Needs, Irrigation Methods, Irrigation of Trees and Shrubs, Irrigation Scheduling Using Evapotranspiration (ET), and Soil Properties and Water Availability to Roots. Irrigating Fruit and Shade Trees and Shrubs provides an index to more resources. See also Abiotic Disorders of Landscape Plants and \"Water Management\" in the California Master Gardener Handbook.

Dig a shallow hole and set the plant on settled ground in the center of the hole. Make sure the top of the plant's root crown is level with or slightly above surrounding soil. Avoid poorly drained areas or places where water frequently collects. Planting too deep or too shallow are common problems. Deep planting favors root and crown diseases. Planting too shallow leads to root damage from exposure and excessive drying. Remove the container, cut any wires or rope around the root ball, and place the plant in the hole and position the main stem perpendicular to the ground. Check for roots that circle the container and gently spread them. Cut any broken or encircling roots. Do not use the plant if it is extensively rootbound. Backfill the hole after properly positioning the plant and preparing the roots. Do not cover the container soil with field soil, as the difference in texture can prevent water from penetrating into the container soil around the roots. Settle the soil after planting by watering. Keep a four foot diameter or larger area around the trunk free of turf or other vegetation. Remove any trunk wrapping that came with the new plant, as it may restrict trunk growth. In extreme situations only, prevent sunscald by applying white interior or exterior latex paint (without a solvent base), diluted 50% with water, to the trunk.",

        "description": "Salts are compounds that separate into positively and negatively charged molecules or elements in water or moist soil. These charged particles are called ions. Anions are negatively charged compounds or elements, such as nitrate, chloride, and sulfate. Cations are positively charged, such as ammonium, iron, calcium, magnesium, and sodium. Plants obtain most nutrients from dissolved ions and tolerate many types of salts in low concentrations. However, foliage and roots can be injured by exposure to high concentrations of almost any type of salt, including those in certain fertilizers, low-quality irrigation water, ocean spray, road deicing salt, and soils.",
        "identification": "Foliage exposed directly to excess sodium from irrigation sprinklers or sea spray discolors, beginning terminally and (in broadleaves) marginally. Leaves may drop prematurely. Foliar salt exposure typically produces a distinct pattern of damage, such as only on lower foliage wetted by sprinklers that apply low-quality irrigation water or on the windward side of plants facing an ocean breeze. Symptoms are more severe in sensitive plant species and as the salt concentrations increase. Buds, twigs, and entire branches may be killed, leading to witches\u2019 broom growth the next season. Severely affected plants may die. Root exposure to high sodium concentrations causes wilted foliage and stunted plant growth. This is because excessive salts in soil impede plants\u2019 uptake of water and cause plant tissues to become dry and discolored. If salt is high, but not extremely high, plants may grow slowly but not show other obvious symptoms. In broadleaves, excess salts carried with water into the plant will concentrate at leaf margins and tips, which turn yellow, then brown. Symptoms usually begin on the older foliage, which may die and drop prematurely. In evergreen broadleaves, foliage damage due to salts may be more pronounced on the south side of plants. Conifer needles turn yellow, then brown from the tip inward, then drop prematurely. Soils high in exchangeable (readily available) sodium relative to calcium and magnesium are called sodic soils, and their soil pH usually exceeds 8.5. Sodic soils are sometimes evident because of a dark or white crust on the soil surface and slow water penetration. Sodium may damage roots through direct toxicity and kill sensitive plants. High levels of sodium can destroy the aggregate structure of fine- and medium-textured soils. This decreases porosity and prevents soil from holding sufficient air and water needed for plant growth. Salt toxicity is most common in soils on the western side of the Central Valley of California, Northern California\u2019s Livermore Valley, parts of the Mojave Desert, some coastal areas in Southern California, and filled soils around the San Francisco Bay shoreline. Toxicity also occurs from irrigation with water high in salts, such as from shallow wells, surface water that passes through arid areas, treated (recycled) municipal wastewater, and where salt is applied to deice pavement. Frequent irrigation of poorly drained soils and excessive fertilization also can result in salt damage. Even moderately low salt concentrations of specific ions (e.g., boron) can damage plants. For a summary of conditions and locations where salt damage to plants is most likely to occur see this table.",
        "damage": "",
        "disorder_development": "",
        "solutions": "Because symptoms similar to those of salt damage can be caused by water deficit and certain other maladies, test soil and irrigation water to definitely diagnose whether salinity is the cause of symptoms. If irrigating with domestic water, contact the water agency to obtain its test results for salinity and specific ions. Testing for salinity. To determine whether excess sodium is present, have a plant diagnostic laboratory measure the soil\u2019s sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), the ratio of sodium to calcium plus magnesium. Total salt (salinity) in soil is usually measured by a laboratory test of electrical conductivity of an extract (ECe) of a saturated paste (soggy soil) reported in units of millimhos per centimeter (mmhos/cm), which is the same as decisiemens per meter (dS/m), since 1 mmho/cm = 1 dS/m. Plants vary greatly in their tolerance for salinity. Depending on the species, sensitive plants may be damaged if soil ECe exceeds 2 to 4 mmhos/cm, while tolerant species are not damaged unless soil ECe exceeds about 8 to 10 mmhos/cm. Salinity in irrigation water is measured as electrical conductivity (ECw), or more commonly as total dissolved solids (TDS) reported as milligrams per liter (mg/L) or parts per million (ppm). For landscape irrigation, water should generally be below about 1,000 mg/L TDS or below 1 mmho/cm ECw. Salinity remediation. Saline soils cannot be remedied with chemical amendments or fertilizers. They can be remedied by leaching, but you may first need to improve soil drainage by adding subsurface drainpipes or tiles. To leach, apply water that is low in soluble salts to move salts deeper into soil. During each irrigation apply a greater volume of low-salt water than needed to wet the root zone. The extra water is called the leaching fraction. For example, water for a longer amount of time and, if warranted, increase the interval between irrigations to avoid overwatering and waterlogging the soil. Sodic soils also need leaching, but first apply gypsum so calcium displaces sodium as water moves it through soil. If soil is high in free calcium (lime), sulfur may be applied before leaching. Before leaching sodic soil, have soil tested to determine whether it is beneficial to apply gypsum, sulfur, or other amendments, and if so, how much to apply. Salinity prevention methods. To help prevent topsoil salinity apply mulch around plants to reduce evaporation of soil moisture. Evaporation concentrates minerals near the soil surface where most roots occur. Minimize fertilizer applications where salinity is a problem because fertilizers add salts to the soil. If applying fertilizers, use products with a low salt hazard (salt index). Obtain an analysis or test the salinity of animal manures, composts, and sewage sludge before deciding to apply them. Instead of using rock salt to deice pavement, consider using alternatives such as calcium magnesium acetate (CMA) or sand. When irrigating, provide enough low-salt water to move salts below the root zone. Where salinity may be a problem, avoid planting species with a low salt tolerance. Grow salt-tolerant species. Especially when growing more salt-tolerant species, recycled water such as treated municipal wastewater can be acceptable for use in drip or flood irrigation or other ways that do not wet foliage. Foliage is more sensitive to salts than roots. Avoid using sprinklers if irrigating with salty water. If foliage is exposed to salts, rinse leaves with good-quality water if possible.

Certain vascular wilt fungi persist in plant material and soil, such as the Fusarium that infects and kills date palms. Chips from plants affected by these pathogens should not be used for mulch or allowed to enter greenwaste. Root-decay pathogens. If trees are infected or killed by root pathogens, wood chips from the branches and upper trunk of the trees generally do not pose a risk of infection. However, bark and wood from the lower trunk, root crown, and roots (e.g., from stump grinding) can be contaminated with pathogens such as Armillaria and Phytophthora spp. These plant parts should not be used beyond the already infested area unless they are treated to eliminate the pathogens. Wood from Armillaria-infected trees can be used as mulch after it has been chipped well or ground to avoid large (>2-inch) chunks and spread until it completely air-dries. For Phytophthora spp. and certain other pathogens, wood chips must be heated sufficiently through proper composting, solarization (e.g., in bags or containers), steam, or other means to ensure that any Phytophthora spores are killed. Treatments. Proper treatment includes finely chopping or grinding the wood then exposing all the material to temperatures of at least 131\u00b0F for a period of 3 days or longer, depending on the particular process. See the composting regulations at calrecycle.ca.gov for the proper methods. After proper composting or other heating methods, store the material on a clean surface and keep it covered to prevent contact with fresh debris, soil, and other untreated material that could contaminate it.

        "description": "A mulch is any material placed on the soil to cover and protect it. Mulches suppress annual weeds by limiting light required for weed establishment. Many types of landscape mulches are available. The most common are bark and other wood products and black plastic or landscape fabric materials. Other products include paper (e.g., in rolls, or sheet mulch), yard compost, hulls from nuts (almonds) or cereals (rice), municipal composts, and stones. In addition to good weed control, mulch conserves soil moisture by reducing evaporation and reducing water use by weeds. Mulch moderates the soil wetting and drying cycle between irrigations and moderates soil temperatures around roots, improving plant growth. Mulch also reduces compaction and erosion from irrigation, rainfall, and foot traffic. When mulch is promptly applied to an adequately prepared site, especially after removing perennial weeds and their propagules, occasional hand-pulling or shallow hoeing of weed seedlings and periodic reapplication of organic mulch may be the only weed management activities necessary. If perennials become established, other practices such as herbicide use may be necessary. Mulch can also be combined with a preemergence herbicide. The mulch type and thickness, herbicide placement on top versus beneath mulch, and preemergence herbicide efficacy are among the important considerations when combining mulch and preemergence herbicide. See Pest Notes: Weed Management in Landscapes for how to use mulches effectively and specific herbicide recommendations for use with mulch.",

        "description": "Plants require certain mineral elements for healthy growth. Deficiencies reduce shoot growth and leaf size and cause foliage to discolor, fade, and distort, sometimes in a characteristic pattern that can help you identify the cause. Fewer leaves, flowers, and fruit may be produced. Severely deficient plants may exhibit dieback, remain undersized, and be predisposed to other maladies. Sufficient micronutrients (e.g., iron, manganese, and zinc) are usually present in landscape soils, but they may be deficient in sandy soils. Deficient macronutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium) are more common in containers and planter boxes and when growing fruit and nut trees, palms, and profusely flowering shrubs (e.g., roses). However, except for nitrogen, most nutrient deficiency symptoms are not due to a deficiency of nutrients in soil; they usually result from other causes, commonly adverse soil conditions and anything that makes roots unhealthy. For example pH, whether soil is acidic or alkaline and how much so, affects nutrient availability to roots.",
        "identification": "Common causes of deficiency symptoms include aeration deficit and poor drainage, high pH of irrigation water or soil (especially with plants adapted to acidic soil e.g., azaleas and rhododendrons), and inappropriate irrigation. Other causes that limit nutrient uptake and can result in deficiency symptoms include mechanical (physical) injury to roots, soil-dwelling nematodes, root decay pathogens, and anything else that injures roots or restricts root growth (e.g., hard pan layers, insufficient soil volume). With certain exceptions (e.g., fruit and nut trees, palms, plants in containers, and perhaps roses and certain other heavily flowering shrubs), fertilization of established woody plants is not recommended unless specific knowledge of the local soil or a soil analysis indicates soil nutrients are insufficient. Applying nitrogen to young trees and shrubs can help plants reach a desirable size sooner, but fertilizing with nitrogen increases plants' need for irrigation and pruning and can cause plants to outgrow the available space. Adding nutrients will not improve the appearance of foliage already damaged by other causes and may divert attention from solving the true cause of unhealthy plants.",

Improve soil drainage, such as incorporate sand. Increase the frequency between irrigations to the extent compatible with healthy plant growth. Where growth on hardscapes is a problem Minimize the amount of eroding soil and water flowing over concrete or other impermeable surfaces. For example, redirect downspout water away from hardscapes. Moss prefers partly shaded locations, so its growth may be reduced by increasing light around plants, such as by thinning branches and nearby plants. However, increased light can also stimulate growth of lichens and sometimes algae. Herbicidal soaps developed specifically to control algae, lichens, and mosses can be applied where these growths are not tolerable or are creating a slipping hazard. Certain copper sprays, iron HEDTA, or certain other algaecides/herbicides (pesticides) may be applied to provide control according to product labels.

        "description": "Iron or manganese2 New broadleaf foliage is undersized and yellow to whitish, except for green along the veins when iron or manganese or both are deficient. Brown dead spots may develop at margins, tips, and between veins. Conifers\u2019 upper canopy and palms\u2019 newer fronds become yellow while lower foliage appears normal. Iron and manganese deficiency are common in plants growing in sandy soils and in species adapted to acidic soil that are grown in high-pH (alkaline) soil. Magnesium This deficiency is common in palms, especially date palms, and rare in landscape broadleaf plants and conifers. In magnesium-deficient palms leaf tips and terminals turn bright yellow, while leaf bases and along the midrib remain green. Lower (older) fronds may die prematurely when magnesium is deficient. In magnesium-deficient broadleaf plants, foliage can become chlorotic or both chlorotic and necrotic. Nitrogen Older leaves or needles become uniformly pale green to yellowish when nitrogen is deficient. New growth is sparse and undersized but is usually green. Plants grow slowly and may drop foliage prematurely. Palms develop color gradation with the oldest fronds becoming the most chlorotic and sometimes turning completely yellow or whitish. Phosphorus The young foliage of broadleaf plants becomes abnormally dark green when phosphorus is deficient. Leaves overall or veins only may be purplish, especially on leaves' underside. Conifers\u2019 older needles become dull colored or gray green and drop prematurely. Phosphorus deficiency is rare in landscapes except where topsoil has been removed such as during development. Potassium Foliage growth is sparse when potassium is deficient. Older broadleaf foliage is yellowish or brown at the tips and margins and between veins. Leaf edges crinkle or curl. Conifer needles become dark blue-green, yellow, or brown and undersized with dead tips. Older palm fronds have yellow, orange, or brown in flecks or spots or along margins, tips, and midribs. Potassium deficiency is rare in California landscapes except in container plants, fruit and nut trees grown in sandy soils, and palms. Zinc2 Broadleaf foliage becomes uniformly yellowish or pale between the veins, especially on new growth when zinc is deficient. Spring leaf flush and blossoming may be delayed. New leaves may be narrow, undersized, and growing in tufts. Older leaves may drop prematurely. Conifer needles are yellowish and undersized and may drop prematurely. Sandy soils commonly lack sufficient zinc. 1. Deficiency symptoms commonly result from adverse soil conditions and anything that makes roots unhealthy. These include conditions favoring salt damage to plants, pH problems, or salinity, or salt toxicity. Conditions that injure roots include aeration deficit (waterlogging), soil-dwelling nematodes, poor irrigation practices, and root decay pathogens). Hardpan soil layers and insufficient soil volume also inhibit plants' nutrient uptake. Note that nutrient excess can also damage plants, including excess nitrogen and boron and other specific ions. Nutrient availability to plants also varies according to soil pH. Soil pH of 6 to 7.5 is best for the growth of most plants. 2. Micronutrient deficiency symptoms especially are generally not due to insufficient nutrients in soil. ",

        "description": "Phytotoxicity is injury to plants caused by chemicals, including air pollutants, fertilizers, and pesticides. Because they are designed specifically to kill plants, herbicides pose the greatest risk of phytotoxicity when desirable plants are exposed these pesticides.",
        "identification": "Unless you definitely know desirable plants were exposed to a kind of herbicide that affects plants of that age and type, investigate whether other causes of similar symptoms are responsible. Causes of symptoms resembling herbicide damage include aeration deficit leaf spot pathogens natural leaf variegation nutritional disorders pH, inappropriate acidity or alkalinity other chemical phytotoxicity root-feeding nematodes salinity viral diseases water deficit Herbicide damage is usually most severe on plants nearest to where it was applied. Unlike with most diseases and insects, when an herbicide is the cause, often more than one plant species is damaged. Necrotic spots on leaves of a similar age may indicate drift of postemergence herbicide. Chlorosis or necrosis caused by a soil-applied, preemergence herbicide is usually most prominent in older foliage, since time has allowed the herbicide to accumulate. Symptoms are often most prominent in new growth when inappropriate soil conditions or poor root health are the cause. Inspect surrounding plants, including weeds, to observe where herbicide was applied and to determine whether injury resulted from root absorption or aerial drift.",
        "damage": "Each type of herbicide or chemical family produces characteristic damage symptoms, including malformed, distorted leaves and shoots stunted shoots and roots chlorotic, necrotic, or spotted leaves In some cases plants will be stunted, growth will be atypically slow. In the worst cases, desirable plants will die.",
        "disorder_development": "Phytotoxicity is most likely when label directions are not followed, such as applying excessive rates or exposing desirable plants that are sensitive to the herbicide. Landscapes can be injured as a result of herbicide application and movement (e.g., drift) from nearby properties, rights-of-way, or turf, and when tree roots grow in treated soil. Spray equipment contaminated with minute quantities of certain herbicides can damage plants when used later to apply fertilizers, fungicides, or insecticides. Each type of herbicide or chemical family produces characteristic damage symptoms. Some types of herbicides affect only plants of a certain age (e.g., only seedlings) or type (only broadleaves or grasses, but not both). Preemergence herbicides must be applied before seeds germinate; they kill germinating seeds for several weeks or months after application. Postemergence herbicides are applied to emerged weeds. Certain products contain multiple herbicides e.g., two or more postemergence herbicides. Postemergence herbicides. Some herbicides are nonselective (broad-spectrum); they can kill both weeds and desirable plants that are sprayed. Postemergence herbicides that are nonselective, or are selective for (designed to kill) broadleaves, are most likely to damage landscapes; avoid using them in established landscapes, or use them only when you can avoid exposing desirable plants. Some postemergence herbicides move systemically (translocate) within plants. Treating cut stumps with systemic herbicide to prevent resprouting can damage nearby plants because natural root grafts are common between adjacent trees of the same species; herbicide translocates from treated stumps through grafted roots to nearby trees. Broadleaf herbicides. Postemergence, broadleaf herbicides include 2,4-D, dicamba, and triclopyr. They can be absorbed through roots and translocate within plants, resulting in twisted shoots and leaf petioles and dwarfed, distorted, and discolored foliage. These herbicides can severely damage or kill broadleaf trees and shrubs if their roots grow under treated lawns, if droplets drift during application, or after application when warm weather causes herbicide to vaporize and move in air. Spray equipment used to apply them becomes contaminated with their difficult-to-remove residues; using the same equipment to apply insecticides or fungicides can result in phytotoxicity. Dicamba and 2,4-D are contained in some lawn \"weed-and-feed\" products. Dicamba in particular can injure woody broadleaves exposed to even very low amounts. Nonselective herbicides. Postemergence, nonselective herbicides include glyphosate, glufosinate, and pelargonic acid. Glyphosate contamination on broadleaves\u2019 basal buds, foliage, or thin or green bark can cause leaves to turn yellow or mottled green and sometimes die. Plants exposed to this nonselective herbicide in the fall or winter may not exhibit symptoms until months later when new growth appears in the spring. Plant growth is then distorted and stunted, and leaves appear needlelike, puckered, and undersized. Roses in the landscape are quite sensitive to glyphosate absorbed through green stems, and the symptoms are often delayed. Preemergence herbicides. With preemergence herbicide damage, aboveground symptoms first appear on foliage. Often, damage is observed on leaves as brown or yellow spots where herbicide granules landed and were not washed off. In plants with leaves in whorls, herbicide may accumulate in the whorls and damage will not be observed until new leaves emerge. After root exposure to preemergence herbicide, leaves may develop white or yellow veins, or veins remain green and tissue between them becomes chlorotic or pale. Sometimes chlorosis progresses to necrosis (blotchy, interveinal, or marginal) and foliage dies. Some preemergence herbicides can persist for months. If roots grow into treated soil, such as nearby fence lines or roadsides, damage can occur long after the application. Label instructions for preemergence herbicides often require adjusting the application rate according to soil type. Not knowing the specific soil type and failing to properly adjust the rate, increase the likelihood of phytotoxicity. Many preemergence herbicides are tolerated by established woody plants, especially plants with healthy, well-developed root systems. Damage sometimes occurs if preemergence herbicide is applied at high rates, incorporated too deeply into the root zone, is not labeled for the site, or is applied near poorly rooted young plants or shallow-rooted plants.",
        "solutions": "Avoid phytotoxicity by applying herbicides and other pesticides carefully, as directed on the label. Use nonchemical weed management methods when feasible. If phytotoxicity has occurred, be diligent about providing plants with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation. Incorporating activated charcoal, compost, manure, or organic mulch into topsoil and keeping soil moist when temperatures are warm can help reduce the concentration of certain preemergence herbicides through microbial degradation or because the herbicides bind to organic particles. It takes time for herbicide residues to completely degrade and new, uninjured growth to appear. If phytotoxicity is suspected, learn what herbicides have been used on-site or nearby when they were used at what rate they were applied conditions at time of application what plants are susceptible to them, and the type of damage caused by them You may be able to diagnose phytotoxicity by having a laboratory test soil for preemergence herbicides or test foliage for systemic pesticides or spray residue. Samples should be tested soon after plant exposure. Such tests are expensive, and laboratories require you to identify the specific herbicides for which you want tests. Be aware that some soil-active herbicides can affect plants at concentrations that are below the minimum detection limit of the laboratory. If preemergence herbicides are suspected, bioassays may be useful as the first step to determine whether herbicide residue is causing the problem. Collect soil from the upper 2 inches and separately from one or more deeper areas in the root zone. Separately collect uncontaminated soil that is otherwise similar. Plant seeds into small containers of these soils. Use species known to be susceptible to the suspect herbicides, such as target weeds listed on the label or sensitive, desirable species the label warns you not to spray. Provide good growing conditions and appropriate cultural care and compare the emergence or growth of plants from the different soils. Abiotic Disorders of Landscape Plants Herbicide Symptoms",

Cold injury is most likely to occur during autumn and spring, the coldest times during winter, and when temperatures decline rapidly after warm weather. Often injury is not apparent until days after a freeze and when temperatures rise. However, by the summer, new growth often replaces tissue damaged by cold during spring. Plants adapted to the local environment usually are not permanently harmed.",
        "identification": "Symptoms resembling freezing and frost injury are also caused by anthracnose and other leaf and shoot diseases, gas or mechanical injury to roots, phytotoxicity, and water deficit. Cold temperature damage causes buds, flowers, and shoots to curl, turn brown or black, and die. Foliage appears scorched because low temperatures severely dehydrate plant tissue. Bark and wood can crack or split, and whole branches or entire plants may be killed if temperatures are below those tolerated by the plant. Frost and freezing produce the same damage but occur under different conditions, and some of their management strategies differ. Freezing occurs when air temperatures are 32\u00b0F or colder. Frost occurs when air is warmer than 32\u00b0F but plant tissues drop to 32\u00b0F or below because plants radiate (lose) heat into the atmosphere, especially during cool, clear nights.",
        "damage": "",
        "disorder_development": "",
        "solutions": "Choose species well adapted to the climate and seasonal temperatures for the location. To increase a soil's ability to absorb heat and warm plants, control weeds and during winter rake away mulch and keep soil bare. When frost or freezing are expected, irrigate dry topsoil at least 3 days before the cold weather to increase the soil's ability to retain heat. When frost is expected, cover sensitive plants overnight with cloth or similar material other than plastic to reduce heat loss to the atmosphere, but leave covers open at their bottom so heat from soil can help warm plants. Remove covers during the day. During freezing, covering plants is of little help unless a heat source is provided. Placing incandescent lights designed for outdoor use in the canopy may generate enough heat to prevent plants from freezing if plants are also covered. Be sure not to create electrical shock or fire hazards. Operating misters or sprinklers to wet foliage continuously and flooding beneath plants during freezing are used in some commercial situations, but generally not in landscapes. With sprinklers, the irrigation system and plants must be able to tolerate being covered with ice, and flooding soil can damage plants. Do not combine the use of outdoor lights with flooding or sprinkling. Do not prune freeze-damaged plants until after you are certain what tissues are dead, preferably by waiting until spring or summer after new growth begins. An exception is limbs or trunks that are hazards and may fall. Replant with more cold-tolerant species.",

When fire is the cause of this thermal injury, it blackens bark in addition to scorching foliage. Wildfire results in one-sided plant injury along edges and distinct boundaries to the burn zone. Lightning strikes can also burn plants, typically isolated or tall trees at higher elevations in eastern and northern California. Proper maintenance and placement of plants and avoidance of fire-prone species dramatically reduce the likelihood that vegetation fires will burn structures. Building materials, structure type, topography, and other factors are also important in minimizing fire hazards, but only landscape plants are discussed here. Large plants provide more fuel than small plants and plants present a greater fire hazard the closer they are to structures. Unwatered (nonirrigated) landscapes generally increase the risk of fire.",

        "disorder_development": "",
        "solutions": "Provide a defensible space to reduce the risk of structural damage caused by fire. In some areas prone to wildfires, laws require a vegetation-free area around structures; consult local fire officials. Irrigation. Provide plants with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation to improve plant resistance to fire. Even drought-adapted species may benefit from watering every 1 to 2 months during the dry season, and the increased moisture may decrease their flammability. Plant placement. In fire-prone areas, keep larger plants farther away from structures and prevent large plants from contacting structures or overhanging roofs. Avoid grouping together a progression of shorter to taller plants; these provide a fuel \u201cladder,\u201d allowing a ground fire to reach the tree canopies where fire can readily spread from one tree to the next. Pruning. Properly cut off lower limbs to provide a fuel break between the ground and tree canopies. Prune out dead branches and remove dead or dying plants. Thin crowns (remove some branches) by pruning limbs that form bridges between tall plants. Sanitation. In fire-prone areas, minimize the buildup of organic litter (bark, leaves, etc.) around trees and structures. Keep flammable mulches well away from homes and other structures.

Fertilize only as needed and only if other problems have been eliminated as the cause of poor growth. Avoid overfertilization, especially with high nitrogen fertilizers. Overfertilization promotes excessive foliage that may increase populations of pests such as mites, aphids, and psyllids. Excessive growth may cause bark to crack, allowing entry of fungi. Excessive fertilizer may also kill roots and burn or kill foliage. With the possible exception of young plants and fruit and nut trees, woody species in landscapes should not be routinely fertilized. As long as woody plants exhibit normal leaf size and color and desired growth, nutrients are probably adequate. Learn to recognize symptoms of nutrient deficiencies in established plants. Deficiencies cause foliage to discolor, fade, distort, or become spotted. Fewer leaves, flowers, and fruit may be produced and these can develop later than normal and remain undersized if plants are suffering from deficiencies.",

Corn should be planted on raised beds, made by adding large amounts of sifted compost or other soil amendments so that a bed is established above the previous level of soil. Beds should be about 36 inches wide with a row of corn on each side of the bed. Plants should be 8 to 12 inches apart in the row. Plant the seed 1 to 1.25 inches deep and firm the soil well over the seed. To insure pollination, plant corn in blocks instead of long rows. Make several successive plantings for a longer harvest period. Usually plant every 3 weeks in early spring to every week in the later spring period for successive harvests.",

The process is called \"blanching.\" Blanching is done by covering the asparagus bed with heaps of shredded leaves or loose mulch or covering the bed with black plastic.

        "description": "Pruning is not always necessary. However, when pruning your tomatoes, remember these main points: Plants with two or more stems produce more tomatoes with better foliage protection from the sun than plants with one stem. However, tomatoes pruned to one leader will bear earlier but with less yield overall. Choose the stems you want to keep and pinch out the others as they develop. A dense leaf canopy may reduce the incidence of black mold and cracking but may increase the incidence of other fruit molds such as gray mold. Severe pruning to one stem will reduce your total crop greatly and also is likely to increase the incidence of some diseases or disorders. Before removing suckers or side shoots on a tomato plant, wait until two leaves develop and pinch above them.",

Various synthetic materials have become available, including vented polyethylene, spunbonded polyester, and woven plastics. Among the easiest to use are the spunbonded or floating row covers that can either be placed on top of the bed with no frames or hoops or be placed over a dome structure. Normally plant covers or cages are kept on only during the sensitive seedling and young plant stages. Place covers on seedlings early so insects will not be able to lay eggs under the cover. Once the young plant gets big enough to tolerate some damage, the cover may be removed. Covers can be left on for complete protection from birds and insects. Although protective covers may limit the ability to check on the plants regularly or to irrigate easily, unless drip irrigation is installed, they may help the manipulation of other environmental conditions such as humidity and sunlight.",

However, the resulting tubers take longer to produce and have more variation at harvest than do potatoes that are planted from seed potatoes. If planting from seed, plant on raised beds made by adding large amounts of sifted compost or other soil amendments so that a bed is established above the previous level of soil. Seed can also be started indoors in flats, peat pots, or other small containers 8 weeks before the last frost date. After the danger of frost has passed, transplant into the garden. Seed potatoes can also be planted in mulch piles or in cages. Plant seed pieces the same as above. Loosely shake mulch over the bed until it is 6 to 10 inches deep. As the plants grow, continue to add more loose straw. Keep tubers covered at all times. To plant in cages or bins or cribs, again plant the same way, covering the plants with 4 inches of soil. After the plant emerges, continue to add well-aged compost, mulch, or soil. Because the cage is above ground, potatoes dry out quickly, so this method will require more frequent irrigation. When transplanting potatoes, place the seed pieces or whole small seed potatoes into 3-inch deep furrows, spaced 6 to 12 inches apart. The closer the spacing the smaller the harvested potatoes will be. Fill the furrows to ground level with soil. Leave them until the shoots emerge from the soil. Once the shoots are about 8 inches long, gently hill them over with more soil. Leave about 4 inches of the top of the plant exposed.

Do not remove the papery covering on the bulblet. Do not break apart the mother bulb until the plant is ready to plant. Plant 2 inches deep and space 4 inches apart in the row, with 12 inches between the rows. The larger the bulblet, the larger the bulb of garlic at harvest. Onions can be grown from seed, sets, or transplants. Onions produce better from seed or transplants rather than from onion sets. Much of the energy in onion sets seems to go into producing seed stock instead of bulbs. Onion sets (small bulbs), unless properly stored, will tend to bolt rather than set a large bulb. To sow directly into the garden, plant seed about 0.25 inch deep and maintain good soil moisture. Plant more seeds than necessary and then thin plants, using the small plants as scallions or as transplants for other areas. Save the strongest transplants to produce bulbs. Space transplants about 4 to 5 inches apart and plant to cover the base of the bulb with just enough soil to anchor it in place. ",

Cultivation and handweeding selectively remove weeds from plantings. These methods can be time consuming and must be repeated frequently until the plantings become established. Careless cultivation can damage plants with shallow roots, bring weed seeds to the soil surface, and propagate perennial weeds. When cultivating, avoid deep tilling, as this brings buried weed seeds to the soil surface, where they are more likely to germinate. Frequent hand removal of weeds when they are small and have not yet set seed will rapidly reduce annual weeds. Certain perennial weeds with vegetative propagules can be spread by cultivation. Use shovels to effectively remove all roots, nutlets, and stems of these weeds. Garden and push-pull hoes can be used to cut small annual weeds and seedlings at slightly below ground level. Weeding hoes are used to cut weeds below the soil line and pull them out of the soil. Hand tines are good for loosening soil around larger weeds and cultivating weed seedlings in small areas. Once weeds are large, hoes and other tools are not very effective and weeds must be removed by hand.",

Hot temperatures, changes in soil moisture and fertility, and harvesting too late may cause fruit to become bitter or lacking in flavor. Cool temperatures, lack of light, poor soil quality, drought, or excess water may cause plants to grow slowly, not develop properly, or not emerge at all.
