        "description": "The asparagus beetle, Crioceris asparagi, and the spotted asparagus beetle, C. duodecimpunctata, may both be found in gardens. In California C. asparagi is more likely to be found. Larvae are dark green-gray grubs about 3/4 inch (9 mm) long when full grown. Asparagus beetle adults may be bluish black beetles with a red prothorax and yellow spots and red borders on wings. Spotted asparagus beetles are reddish orange beetles with black spots. ",
        "identification": "",
        "life_cycle": "Adult beetles overwinter in garden debris, especially old ferns. They emerge when spears first emerge. Beetles feed and lay dark brown eggs singly or in rows on spears. Eggs hatch in 3 - 8 days. Larvae are blue gray with black heads and feed on plant tips. Mature larvae drop to the ground and pupate just below the soil surface. A new generation of adults emerges in 1 - 2 weeks. After spears are harvested, beetles and grubs feed on ferns. There may be up to five generations a year.",
        "damage": "Adults of the asparagus beetle chew the growing tips of spears in spring leaving brown stains, scars, or blemishes. Larvae may chew ferns, causing them to appear bleached. Spotted asparagus beetle larvae feed primarily inside berries while adults do minor damage to ferns. ",
        "solutions": "Remove spears promptly. Handpick beetles or wash eggs, larvae, and adult beetles off with a strong stream of water. Clean up debris and remove and destroy ferns by proper pruning in late fall to reduce overwintering sites for adults. Avoid insecticides because of potential harm to parasites and predators, and damage is not usually serious enough to warrant it. Applications of a pyrethrin spray may be effective against larvae when they are young.",

On tomatoes, eggs are laid on terminal leaflets; in lettuce, a preferred site is the crowns of young seedlings. Eggs are spherical and are laid singly. Newly laid eggs are white, but they develop a reddish brown ring after about 24 hours. Larvae feed on fruit and leaves and drop to the soil to pupate. There are three or four generations per year.",

They destroy seedlings, bore into lettuce heads and bean pods, make deep watery cavities in fruit, and leave frass. On corn, larvae eat through kernels of ears and feed on the developing tassels in the whorls of the plant. Damage is usually limited to the first 2 to 3 inches of the ear. ",
        "solutions": "On corn: Early planted corn is not as seriously affected as is late corn. Consider not treating, and simply cutting off damaged ends of corn at harvest. Applying a few drops of mineral oil with a medicine dropper to silks just inside each ear 3 to 5 days after silks first appear may be effective. Applications of insecticides, such as spinosad must be applied on silks within 3 days after first silks appear and at 3-day intervals until silks turn brown. Bacillus thuringiensis, a biological insecticide, may be dusted on silks every 3 days after 5 to 10% silk formation for partial control. Destroy culls and plants immediately after harvest. On other vegetable crops and fruit: Handpick. Avoid spraying with insecticides. Bacillus thuringiensis, may kill 40 to 60% of the population but must be applied just after eggs hatch and before caterpillars enter fruit. Spinosad may also be effective. Plant early and harvest before late August. Disc or rototill plants immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering populations and prevent migration to neighboring crops. Important natural enemies of the earworms include Hyposoter and Trichogramma parasites. General predators also feed on eggs and larvae.",

        "identification": "Adults of buffalo treehopper are brown or green and 2/5 inch long or shorter. Viewed from above, adults have a triangular shape. They have an expanded first segment behind the head (pronotum) that forms a hoodlike covering on top the front one-half of their body. This enlarged prothorax distinguishes treehoppers from most other true bugs (Heteroptera) they resemble. Treehoppers also have rows of spines along the length of the hind tibia (longest leg segment), as do also cicadas and leafhoppers. To help you discriminate between types (families) of insects with similar-looking adults see Distinguishing Among Sucking Insects That Resemble Each Other. Eggs are 1/16 inch long and occur hidden laid in twigs. First instars are about 1/12 inch long. Nymphs are reddish brown with numerous spines on the back of the abdomen. The nymphs commonly occur in groups on plant stems, especially the younger immatures. Both immatures and adults jump readily when disturbed, such as when they observe movement nearby.",
        "life_cycle": "Treehoppers develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. They overwinter as eggs that are laid in groups in slits that females make in the upper side of twigs. Eggs hatch in spring and the nymphs drop to feed on herbaceous vegetation near where they overwintered as eggs. Adults occur during summer and fall, when the females lay the overwintering eggs. There is one generation per year.",
        "damage": "Treehopper adults and nymphs suck plant juices. This feeding generally causes no noticeable damage to woody hosts. The honeydew they produce supports the growth of blackish sooty mold, which may foul leaves and stems and surfaces underneath them when treehoppers are numerous. The egg laying slits made in small, woody twigs can give bark a roughened appearance. Egg laying injury sometimes stunts terminal growth or slows the overall growth of young hosts.",
        "solutions": "Generally no control is warranted to protect the health of hosts. Eliminating herbaceous weeds can reduce the survival of nymphs and the subsequent abundance of adults, thereby reducing their egg laying damage to twigs. On small plants buffalo treehopper can be controlled somewhat with a forceful spray of water. If treehopper populations were high on deciduous trees and shrubs the previous season and damage cannot be tolerated, horticultural (narrow-range) oil can be applied to thoroughly cover terminals during the dormant season to kill overwintering eggs. If adults or nymphs are abundant, their numbers can be reduced by spraying the exposed insects with horticultural or narrow-range oil or insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids).

Eggs are pearly white to creamy yellow. Young larvae are light buff with clusters of long, dark hairs over the body. As they increase in size, they become more hairy. Mature larvae pupate in 4 to 5 weeks, usually under leaf trash in the soil. Adults emerge in 10 days to 2 weeks, depending on weather.

        "description": "Tomato russet mites are so tiny they cannot be seen without a hand lens. You will see the bronzing they cause on leaves first. Russet mites are conical in shape and yellowish, tan, or pink.",
        "identification": "Tomato russet mites are very small  -  only about 1/5 mm long, so you need at least a 14X lens to see them. Damage would first be present mid- to late summer when plants are half-grown or longer. Damage typically begins on stems and spreads upward. Fruit are usually not attached, but defoliation may expose them to sunburn. If you see damaged leaves, check them for mites. Also check some green leaves just above damaged ones; the mites may move up the plant above the most obvious damage. Don't confuse russet mites with spider mites, which are rounder and larger, usually have two spots, and often produce webbing. Predatory mites are clear and move rapidly.",
        "life_cycle": "",
        "damage": "Leaves and stems damaged by mites develop a greasy appearance, then dry out and turn bronze. Damage starts at the base of the plant and moves upward. In hot weather when mite populations explode, plants may be defoliated.",
        "solutions": "Both sulfur dust and wettable sulfur are effective for russet mite control. Do not grow tomatoes near petunias or any solanaceous plants, such as potato, as they are other hosts of the russet mite.",

        "description": "These sucking insects (family Pentatomidae) are shield shaped. Their common name is because when disturbed they can excrete fluid with an unpleasant odor. Over 50 stink bug species occur in California. Some are beneficial predators of pest insects, including Perillus and Podisus species, such as spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris) and twospotted stink bug (Perillus bioculatus). Most stink bugs are plant feeders and most any plant can at least occasionally be fed upon by these sporadic pests. ",
        "identification": "Adult stink bugs are distinguished from other insects by the large triangle shape with a rounded rear end (scutellum) that occurs on top of the back, covering the rear of the thorax and front portion of the abdomen. In comparison with most insects, adults are wider relative to their length. Stink bug eggs are barrel shaped with circular caps and are generally laid in a group commonly on leaves. The hatching nymphs are nearly round and their coloration may or may not resemble that of adults of the species. Nymph coloration and markings commonly vary among instars. Coloration of adults and nymphs varies by the species from a mix of bright or contrasting colors (e.g., black and orange) to a relatively uniform color, such as mostly brown, gray, or green. For more photos of common species, see CalPhotos from UC Berkeley and Hemiptera (Bugs) from Orange County, California from UC Irvine. Bagrada bug. Bagrada hilaris is an introduced pest that feeds on and damages crucifers (Brassicaceae). It is particularly damaging to crucifer seedlings and leafy mustard greens. It can also be a nuisance in landscapes containing mustards or sweet alyssum. Bagrada bugs are mostly black and orange and the adults and older nymphs have white markings. Eggs are oval, and creamy white when first laid and turn orange as they age. Females lay eggs in the soil beneath host plants but may also oviposit on leaves. First instars have a bright red abdomen and thorax. Later instars are black and orangish red. In comparison with adults of the similar-looking harlequin bug (see below), Bagrada bug adults are smaller (about 1/4 inch long). Adults and late instars have white markings while harlequin bug has no white. Bagrada bug nymphs superficially resemble those of several other stink bug species including the consperse stink bug (see below) and harlequin bug. See Bagrada Bug, Bagrada hilaris and Bagrada hilaris (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), An Invasive Stink Bug Attacking Cole Crops in the Southwestern United States for more information. Brown marmorated stink bug. Halyomorpha halys is an invasive species and pest of various tree fruits and fruiting vegetables. Adults are mottled brown or gray and about 5/8 inch long. Alternating dark and pale markings along the abdominal margins help to distinguish adults from those of other stink bug species. Brown marmorated stink bug most resembles the rough stink bug, Brochymena sulcata, which is a beneficial predator. However adults of rough stink bug have two white bands on their otherwise blackish, hind legs and lack bands on the antennae. Brown marmorated stink bug adults have one white band on the hind legs and white bands on their dark antennae. Consperse stink bug resembles both of these species but has no white bands on its legs. For more on how to discriminate these three species see Brown Marmorated Stink Bug Provisional Guidelines for Apple. Consperse stink bug. Euschistus conspersus adults are about 1/2 inch long and grayish brown to green. They resemble adults of brown marmorated stink bug and rough stink bug. However, unlike the white leg bands described above for these species, consperse stink bug has grayish legs with black speckles. Harlequin bug. Murgantia histrionica adults have mostly black bodies with a variable pattern of orange, red, and yellow. Eggs are grayish yellow with two black bands. First instars have a light orange abdomen with black markings and a brown head and thorax. Later instars develop more black on their bodies with contrasting bright red and yellow. This species resembles Bagrada bug, but it lacks Bagrada bug's characteristic white markings. Adult harlequin bugs are 1/3 inch or longer, while adult Bagrada bugs are 1/4 inch or shorter. Say stink bug. Chlorochroa sayi adults and nymphs are bluish green with a paler green or whitish margin on their abdomen and thorax. Adults are 2/5 to 2/3 inches long. Southern green stink bug. Nezara viridula adults are bright green and about 1/2 inch long. Early instars are pale yellow and late instars are green. Eggs are white to pale yellow.",
        "life_cycle": "Stink bugs develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Adult females lay barrel-shaped eggs in clusters on foliage or litter on the ground. The nymphs commonly remain close together at first but scatter as they grow. They develop through five increasingly larger instars gradually developing wing pads before the adult emerges from the skin of the last instar. Overwintering is on the ground in liter. Stink bugs commonly become active beginning in late winter or spring. Stink bug infestations commonly originate when adults fly in from weedy areas, such as along creeks and sloughs where blackberries grow. In years with a lot of spring rain and late weed growth stink bugs can become especially numerous and cause more widespread damage.",
        "damage": "Adults suck and feed on plants with their strawlike mouthparts. Stink bugs attack a variety of fruits, nuts, and vegetables from beans to tomatoes and apples to stone fruits. Their sucking feeding can cause blemishes in fleshy plant parts and mar plant appearance with drops of dark excrement. Their feeding causes blemishes, dark pinpricks, and other discoloration on fruit and fleshy vegetables. Damaged tissues become pithy and white and remain firm instead of developing their normal color and tasty texture. Where stink bugs earlier fed, fruit can become distorted as it grows. On green tomatoes, damage appears as dark pinpricks surrounded by a light discolored area that remains green or turns yellow when fruit ripen. The surface of feeding spots can become discolored and tissue beneath feeding spots on fruit (e.g., apples, pears, and tomatoes) becomes pithy and brown or white and remains firm as the fruit ripens. On peaches, fruit turns brown and corky. Fed upon seedlings and leafy greens may develop a tattered appearance. Except for the fruit and nuts established woody plants are not seriously harmed by the feeding of stink bugs in most situations. Because other true bugs such as lygus bugs can cause virtually the same damage, the particular cause of plant injury may not be reliably determined unless the bugs themselves were observed feeding on the plants.",
        "solutions": "Handpick the bugs and their eggs from small plants. Eliminate groundcovers and other herbaceous vegetation such as weeds in early spring before stink bugs become abundant there and then move to alternative hosts. Insecticides are generally not recommended in gardens and landscapes for stink bugs. Commonly stink bug feeding damage does not become apparent until after plant tissues grow, by which time the stink bugs may no longer be present. Parasites and general predators can contribute to the control of some stink bug species if natural enemies are not destroyed, such as by the application of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for tips on preserving parasites and predators. If bugs are coming indoors, see Integrated Pest Management Checklist for Early Care and Education Programs (PDF) from UC San Francisco. This lists steps to take in and around buildings to eliminate or greatly reduce insects coming inside.

Adult moths are light gray, peppered with small black flecks, and can be confused with the potato tuberworm. Don't confuse leaf damage with mining of leafminers, which is narrow and meandering, with a dark line of feces threaded through it. Leafminers never fold leaves. ",
        "life_cycle": "Eggs are laid on lower surfaces of leaves. Larvae usually begin to feed in leaf mines before moving to fruit. Larvae may complete development in leaf shelters, or they may leave to enter fruit, later pupating on the ground or in soil. Adults, which emerge from pupae after a few days, are active mostly at night. Mating occurs soon after emergence and females lay most of their eggs within 2 days. There can be as many as seven or eight overlapping generations per year; the life cycle takes less than a month in summer, but may take 3 to 4 months in winter. In mild winters, development continues as long as host plants are available; there is no diapause.",
        "damage": "Pinworms cause leaf mines and folded shelters on leaves. They bore into fruit at the stem ends, creating narrow, blackened tunnels. Damage is hard to detect at first, but after larvae have been feeding for some time, a brown, granular frass usually appears at the edge of the calyx. ",
        "solutions": "Tomato pinworms are difficult to control with insecticides, and natural enemies are not effective. Disc all plants immediately after harvest. A host-free period of 3 months or more is essential to control pinworms.",

        "description": "These sucking insects (family Cercopidae) can at least occasionally be found on almost any plant. They are also called froghoppers because adults rest with their head elevated. Only about one-half dozen species of spittlebug are known in California. These include Clastoptera lineatocollis and those discussed below.",
        "identification": "Where spittlebug nymphs suck and feed on plant tissue (xylem fluid), they surround themselves with frothy white excrement beginning during the second instar. One or more nymphs can occur in a single spittle mass. Nymphs are stout and commonly pale green, orange, or yellow. Adult spittlebugs readily fly or jump when disturbed. They are stout and commonly brownish, gray, or tan insects about 1/3 inch long or less. They resemble leafhoppers (family Cicadellidae), which include sharpshooters. However, spittlebugs lack the long, continuous rows of spines found along the hind tibia (longest leg segment) of leafhoppers. Spittlebugs are discriminated from leafhoppers and other true bugs (Heteroptera) by two stout, thornlike spines along the outer length of hind tibia. Spittlebugs also have a whorl of many spines at the end of the tibia near the tarsi (feet). See Sharpshooters/Spittlebug (PDF) for an illustration comparing the leg spines of leafhoppers versus spittlebugs. To help you discriminate between these and other types (families) of insects with similar-looking adults see Distinguishing Among Sucking Insects That Resemble Each Other. Meadow spittlebug. Philaenus spumarius feeds primarily on broadleaved herbaceous plants, but it also occurs on woody, deciduous species. At least 400 hosts are known. Adults are robust and blackish, brown, tan, yellow, or a mottled mix of these colors. Females lay brown to white eggs in rows at plant nodes. Nymphs are pale green to yellow and occur mostly hidden beneath a foaming mass of spittle. Meadow spittlebug requires cool, humid or moist conditions so it historically has been common in coastal areas. Its populations have declined in recent years and this is believed due to global warming. Western pine spittlebugs. Aphrophora permutata is one of several Aphrophora species that feed on conifers and nearby herbaceous plants. It is especially common on Monterey pine and other pines in coastal areas of California. Other hosts include Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, spruce, and various herbaceous broadleaves. Nymphs are mostly black, brown, or dark greenish. Adults are dark brown to orangish and may have an indistinct diagonal white line across the back. Adults can be up to 1/2 inch long. For a detailed discussion of this pest consult The Biology of Aphrophora permutata and Some Observations on Aphrophora canadensis Attacking Monterey Pine in California.",
        "life_cycle": "Spittlebugs develop through three life stages: egg, nymph and adult. Adult females use their knifelike ovipositor to lay eggs singly into thin-barked branches and succulent, green shoots or in crevices of plants. Each female commonly lays one to several dozen eggs in or on hosts. After hatching, nymphs suck and feed on aboveground parts or near the soil line on the root crown. They begin producing and surrounding their body with spittle during the second instar and grow through four increasingly larger instars. Nymphs remain mobile throughout their life and move to feed in a different location if the quality of the plant part on which they feed declines. Each nymph feeds for 1 to 3 months. The last instar darkens and develops wing pads before maturing into an adult. Adult spittlebugs are relatively long lived, and each can feed and move among plant parts for up to 6 months. Overwintering occurs as tiny eggs on or in stems or needles. Spittlebugs commonly have one or two generations per year in California.",
        "damage": "Feeding by abundant spittlebugs can distort host tissue and slow plant growth, but this is primarily a problem on herbaceous species. On hosts such as pines the egg laying wounds of adult females when abundant can cause shoot tips to die back. Spittlebugs\u2019 obvious and occasionally abundant masses of white foam on foliage and stems may be annoying, but they do not seriously harm established woody plants in landscapes. In certain crops spittlebugs may be important vectors of plant pathogens, such as the Xylella fastidiosa bacterium that causes oleander leaf scorch of oleander and other woody landscape species, Pierce's disease of grapes, and variously named diseases in other crops. However glassy-winged sharpshooter and certain other leafhoppers are the main vectors of X. fastidiosa. The potential importance of spittlebugs in spreading this pathogen in gardens and landscapes may be unknown.",
        "solutions": "Adult spittlebugs are commonly fed upon by birds. Nymphs are preyed upon by assassin bugs, minute pirate bugs, syrphid larvae, and various harvestmen and spiders. Eggs and nymphs are attacked by various parasitic wasps. Although the importance of their natural enemies is not well known, biological control of spittlebugs is generally considered to be not important. Ignore spittlebugs or wash nymphs off with a forceful stream of water. Spittlebugs are more likely to become abundant on woody plants when they migrate from nearby herbaceous hosts. Cut spittlebug-infested weeds in the spring before the insects mature and spread. For more information see Spittlebugs of Canada (PDF), which includes many California species.

        "identification": "Correctly identify the cause of damage before taking action. The biology and management of leafrollers differs from that of other caterpillarlike insects. Various other insects can cause damage that resembles caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. Other leafroller species may occur on the same plant. Omnivorous leafroller larvae have a brown to cream-colored or greenish-brown body up to 3/5 inch long. Larvae have a black or brown head and prothoracic shield, the area just behind the head and on the top and sides of the first abdominal segment. Through the translucent cuticle (outer covering) the main blood vessel running along the back is often visible as a faint dark stripe. The mounds (tubercles) at the base of the bristles along the top and sides are chalky white. Adults are small, dark-brown moths up to 1/2 inch long with a dark band on the wing and a distinct snout. At rest adults appear bell shaped, as do those of other tortricid species.",
        "life_cycle": "Larvae develop through five increasingly larger instars (immature growth stages). Each caterpillar may construct multiple leafroll nests and at maturity pupate inside the nest or on bark in a thin, silken cocoon. Adult females lay eggs overlapping in flat masses, resembling fish scales on leaves or bark. There are up to five or six generations per year in warm interior valleys.",
        "damage": "Omnivorous leafroller feeds on many hosts, including caneberries, fruit and nut trees, grapes, and various ornamentals and weeds. When they feed between leaves and fruit, they can cause substantial fruit scarring.",
        "solutions": "Conserve natural enemies, which often keep leafroller populations low. Parasitic wasps and tachinid flies are especially common in leafroller larvae and pupae. Trichogramma parasites kill some eggs. Assassin bugs, green lacewing larvae, ground beetles and certain other beetles, and spiders are common predators. Clean up gardens by removing weeds that can be alternate hosts of leafroller larvae. Eliminate plant debris that can harbor pupae. Hand removal of webbed leaves and larvae can help control leafrollers on small plants. Otherwise healthy plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees",

Their favored overwintering hosts are alfalfa, yellow starthistle, Russian thistle, wild radish, sweet clover, wild mustard, lupine, and vetch. Adults mate in spring when the weather warms up and lay eggs on a wide range of broadleaf plants. Eggs are inserted into plant tissues flush with the tissue surface. They hatch in 1 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature, and there are five nymphal instars. The first four instars require 2 to 7 days each, and the fifth instar requires 4 to 10 days. Newly emerged females begin laying eggs in about 10 days. There are three to four overlapping generations each year.",

Remove weeds adjacent to the garden before the crop is planted or before susceptible fruit or buds appear on trees. Insecticides are not usually necessary or effective in the garden.

        "description": "Because of their relatively large size and unusual appearance, Jerusalem crickets (family Stenopelmatidae) are commonly brought to entomologists for identification. They have many common names, including \u201cni\u00f1as de la tierra\u201d (children of the earth) and sand crickets. They also are sometimes called potato bugs because they are occasional pests of potatoes, but the name \u201cpotato bug\u201d is confusing because it is applied to several different invertebrates, including Colorado potato beetle, pillbugs, sowbugs, and Jerusalem crickets, none of which are true bugs (Heteroptera). Jerusalem crickets feed and tunnel underground during the day and can occur aboveground mostly at night. They are most often seen when exposed by gardeners turning the soil or above ground after heavy irrigation or rainfall, at night, or at twilight during mild weather. They are easily recognized by their bald, round, humanoid head and fat orangish abdomen with black rings. They have long, brownish antennae and spiny hind legs and lack wings. They grow up to about 2 inches long. Nymphs (immatures) look like small adults. Jerusalem crickets hatch from eggs laid in soil and spend much of their time underground. Nymphs molt up to about 10 times before becoming reproductive adults. Their life span can be up to about 2 years. Jerusalem crickets are harmless to people and woody plants. Their food includes insects, nonwoody roots, and tubers. They only occasionally damage turf and vegetables. Aside from their alarming appearance, they generally are not pests. No control is necessary for Jerusalem crickets. They may be important food for certain vertebrate predators. If found where they are not desired, they can be scooped into a box and thrown away.

Other common flea beetles are the western black flea beetle, Phyllotreta pusilla, which is shiny black to dark olive green, and the western striped flea beetle, P. ramosa, which is black with a white or yellow curved stripe along each side of the back. All flea beetles are tiny, less than 1/10 inch long, and jump like fleas when disturbed.",
        "life_cycle": "Adult flea beetles overwinter in weeds or debris and fly into potato-growing areas in spring. Flea beetles lay very small eggs in the soil around the plant, on the leaves, or in cavities hollowed out in the stems. The larvae are small, slender, white, and wormlike and usually attack the roots but may also feed on foliage. Depending on the species, they rarely cause significant damage except on potato tubers, where they create tunnels in the flesh of tubers. The larval stage may last up to a month. Flea beetles pupate in the soil. There are one or two generations a year.",
        "damage": "Adults feed mostly on leaves, leaving tiny pits or small holes at their feeding sites. Flea beetles feeding together can cover leaves with bleached, pitted areas or ragged holes. Damage is not usually serious beyond early seedling stage. On carrots, larvae may cause sunken spots on roots. On eggplants and potato tubers, larvae feed on roots and stems and can create straight, narrow tunnels in tubers providing an entry for fungi. Small raised bumps may be on surface of tubers. ",
        "solutions": "Remove debris in the fall to remove any overwintering beetles. Seedlings can be protected with protective coverings until they are in the sixth leaf stage; older plants are less likely to suffer damage. Reflective mulches applied very soon after planting and before plants become infected can be helpful. White sticky traps can be used to monitor or trap adults. Insecticides should not normally be necessary and are not very effective when populations are high. Sulfur containing pesticides may be repellent. Often only a few outside rows will require treatment. Carbaryl sprays can provide some control where infestations are serious.",

The western spotted cucumber beetle is greenish yellow and has twelve black spots on its back; the western striped cucumber beetle is yellowish orange and has three black stripes. Cucumber beetles may sometimes be confused with predaceous lady beetles, but can be distinguished by the antennae. Lady beetle antennae are short and stubby; those of cucumber beetles are long and threadlike.

Cucumber beetles may also spread cucumber mosaic virus or wilts in cucurbits. Larvae feed exclusively on roots, but do not generally damage garden plants, although corn may occasionally be damaged.",
        "solutions": "Management of cucumber beetles is difficult. Most older plants can support substantial numbers without serious damage. The best strategy for most vegetable gardens may be to place protective cloth over emerging plants and remove it when plants are old enough to tolerate damage.

        "description": "This fungal disease of roses is usually a problem in California only in foggy or humid coastal areas. It can occur anywhere leaves commonly remain wet, such as where roses are sprinkler irrigated during the evening or night. The fungus produces black spots on the upper surface of rose leaves and stems. Spots sometimes have feathery margins, and tiny, black, fungal fruiting bodies may be visible in the spots. Yellowed areas develop around spots. Infected foliage often drops prematurely. The pathogen persists on living and dead leaves and on infected stems. Its spores are spread by splashing water. For spore production and infection, leaves must remain wet for more than about 7 hours. To reduce black spot, irrigate and hose off aphids in the morning instead of the evening or night. Do not plant roses too close together. Prune canopies to increase air circulation. Prune off infected stems during the dormant season and dispose of fallen rose leaves and stems away from rose plants. Avoid planting roses where they will not receive at least 6 to 8 hours of full sun. Choose disease-resistant varieties when planting. Miniature roses are more susceptible than other types, but a few varieties are reliably resistant to all strains of black spot. neem oil potassium bicarbonate sulfur triforine chlorothalonil Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders",

Abutilon mosaic virus causes vein-limited blotches on leaves. The leaves are heavily mottled with a bright yellow to whitish mosaic. The discolored patches are sharply delimited by leaf veins, giving blotches an angular appearance. Symptoms may vary seasonally depending on light intensity. Other viruses also can infect abutilon. Abutilon mosaic virus is naturally transmitted by an insect vector, the silverleaf or sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci. The whitefly nymphs and adults acquire the virus when feeding on infected plants. Adult whiteflies carrying the virus transmit it when they migrate and feed on other abutilon. The virus is also transmitted by mechanical inoculation (infected sap moved on cutting tools) and by grafting an infected plant part onto an uninfected host. Abutilon mosaic virus is deliberately spread by propagators to produce the bright yellow variegation on the leaves of abutilon plants for sale. Once a plant becomes infected with virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. Abutilon mosaic virus has little or no effect on plant growth, vigor, and flowering. This virus causes no apparent harm to plants. Propagators deliberately select infected plants because many people like these variegated abutilon cultivars. For more information, see Viruses.",

        "description": "Azaleas and rhododendrons are highly susceptible to petal blight, also called flower blight or Ovulinia petal blight. The causal fungus, Ovulinia azaleae, infects only petals, causing white to brownish spots that can enlarge rapidly. The biology of Ovulinia petal blight is nearly identical to that of camellia petal blight. The fungi infect wet blossoms when temperatures are mild, about 50\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F. Ovulinia azaleae persists and reproduces by forming apothecia and sclerotia described above. Ovulinia petal blight also produces colorless conidia (asexual spores) that develop on infected petals. Apothecia forcibly discharge large numbers of spores that are carried by wind onto emerging blooms where they germinate and infect flowers when they are wet. These spores also spread by movement of flower-visiting insects, especially bumble bees. The insect- and wind-borne spores allow the fungus to reproduce and spread between many blossoms within several days of an initial infection. The disease causes premature death of blossoms of Rhododendron species. Infected blossoms develop brownish or white spots that spread over entire petals and flowers. Infected blossoms become droopy, limp, and slimy and sometimes cling to leaves after they die. Sanitation is the primary management method. Remove the top layer of potting soil when new azalea or rhododendron are purchased and replace it with pathogen-free soil. Plant azaleas and rhododendrons in a well-ventilated location. Avoid over-head irrigation and instead install drip or microsprinkler irrigation. Remove and dispose of fallen, old, and infected flowers. Do not add azalea and rhododendron petals or leaves to composting piles or mulch. Even if the organic material is composted, it is difficult to expose all plant debris to the 140\u00b0F required to kill the Ovulinia propagules by composting. Each year when blossoms are no longer present, apply a fresh layer of uncontaminated organic mulch beneath host plants. Maintain about a 4-inch mulch layer to help suppress Ovulinia propagules. Keep mulch thin near the trunk or several inches away from trunks. Application of appropriate fungicides prior to bud break or before rainy weather or both can help to reduce infections. Where petal blight has been a problem, the fungicides chlorothalonil, thiophanate methyl, or triforine can be applied before disease develops. Depending on the fungicide, reapplication may be warranted every 10 to 14 days while conditions remain suitable (foggy or rainy) for the pathogen. Be aware that fungicides often provide only partial control unless they are applied preventatively in combination with the recommended cultural and sanitation practices.

If you purchase oleander and olive during late spring through fall you can see whether plants are galled; plants acquired during the rainy season may be infected but have not yet developed galls. Avoid overhead watering, which spreads the bacteria. Regular monitoring and properly pruning off galled parts help to control the disease, but prune only during the dry season, when the bacteria are inactive, and dispose of infected tissue away from hosts. It may help to limit pathogen spread if you scrub pruning blades clean and disinfect them in a 10 to 20% bleach solution before each cut, especially if plants must be pruned during the rainy season.

Prunus spp. susceptibility to P. syringae is greatly affected by the rootstock. Less-susceptible or resistant rootstocks are available for cherry, peach, and plum. Because rootstocks that are less susceptible to certain pathogens are more susceptible to others, consult publications such as Integrated Pest Management for Stone Fruits to identify the best cultivars for the common problems in your planting situation. Prune and dispose of infected twigs and branches during the dry season; new infections are less likely to occur then. Do not wet foliage with overhead irrigation. Provide good cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation. Keep roots healthy, such as by planting on a broad mound of soil where drainage is poor.

        "description": "Anthracnose is a group of diseases resulting from infection by various fungi. Often called bud, leaf, shoot, or twig blight, damage is most severe when prolonged spring rains occur during or shortly after new plant growth develops. Anthracnose symptoms vary with the host's growth stage and species, weather, and time of year. Small black, brown, or tan spots appear on infected leaves of some hosts, including elm and oak. Dead leaf areas may be more irregular on hosts such as ash. Chinese elm anthracnose, Stegophora ulmea, also called black leaf spot, is a serious disease in coastal areas of California. Fungal infection causes foliage to develop irregular, black, tarlike spots and leaves drop prematurely. Chinese elm anthracnose produces especially large cankers that can weaken, girdle, or kill limbs and trunks. Dogwood anthracnose, Discula destructiva, causes leaves and flower bracts to develop large brownish lesions with well-defined, dark, discolored margins that may be grayish or purple. Infected leaves may drop prematurely or dead gray leaves may remain on twigs in the canopy overwinter. Dogwood anthracnose can severely canker branches, especially in the lower canopy, causing branch dieback and sometimes death of the entire tree. Sycamore anthracnose, Apiognomonia veneta =Discula platani, kills sycamore shoots and leaves. Anthracnose lesions commonly develop first around the major leaf veins, but scattered shoot terminals and entire leaves and groups of leaves are often killed. Anthracnose fungi overwinter primarily in cankers and lesions in infected twigs. On evergreen species such as Chinese elm and live oaks, the fungi can occur year-round on leaves as well as woody parts. Spores are produced when infected tissue is wet. Spores spread by splashing and windborne rain to infect new twigs and foliage. Spore production and infection continue as long as new growth and wet conditions occur together. Once foliage matures and weather becomes warm and dry, disease development slows or stops. Anthracnose does not seriously harm most hosts. Exceptions are when defoliation occurs repeatedly, and certain species at some locations where branch dieback and cankering are extensive. Anthracnose fungi discolor leaves or kill portions of leaves, entire leaves, small groups of leaves, and twigs scattered throughout the canopy. Small branches can be cankered, girdled, and killed on more susceptible hosts, including some species of ash, dogwood, elm, oak, and sycamore. The resulting regrowth from lateral buds can give trees a gnarled or crooked appearance. Where prolonged spring rains or foggy conditions are common, avoid planting especially susceptible species. For example, the Bloodgood, Columbia, and Liberty cultivars of London plane are less susceptible or resistant to sycamore anthracnose, but Yarwood is commonly damaged. Prune and dispose of infected twigs during the fall or winter where practical on small trees so overwintering infections are pruned off. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and do not mulch around hosts using fresh or uncomposted leaves or flowers from plants susceptible to that same anthracnose. Increase sunlight and air circulation (for example, by pruning nearby plants to reduce shade and spacing new plants far enough apart). Pest Notes: Anthracnose",

        "description": "Downy mildews, including Peronospora and Plasmopara spp., are pathogenic water molds (oomycetes) that primarily damage foliage. Hosts include caneberries, rose, various herbaceous ornamentals, and many fruit, grain, and vegetable crops. Downy mildew causes pale green to yellow areas on the upper surface of leaves, and sometimes also discolors buds and stems. Discoloration may turn purplish red to dark brown and necrotic; its shape often depends on leaf veins, which limit the pathogen's spread. Infected leaves may drop prematurely. Where downy mildew lesions occur on the upper surface of leaves, fluffy masses of brown, gray, or purplish spores form on the underside of leaves. Because under ideal, cool moist conditions spores persist for only a few days, often no spores are visible even though downy mildew is causing damage. Downy mildew can be confused with powdery mildew, such as on roses. However, grayish downy mildew spores are almost always limited to the underside of leaves, and viewed under magnification its spores occur in branched stalks (sporangia) like tiny trees. Powdery mildew is common on both sides of the leaf and produces spores on chains, and its whitish to gray growth is typically more extensive and prominent than with downy mildew. Powdery mildews are fungi and downy mildews are oomycetes (not fungi), which partly explains why their biology and management differ. Downy mildew spores are produced only on living plants and spread mostly with air movement. Spores landing on a host germinate and infect within 8 to 12 hours if the plant is wet. Downy mildews are favored by low temperatures (40\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F) and require high relative humidity (\u226590%) or wet foliage to produce spores and infect plants. To control downy mildew, provide good air circulation and maintain low humidity; adequately space plants and prune host canopies and nearby and overhead vegetation. Avoid wetting foliage; use drip or low-volume microsprinklers instead of overhead irrigation where feasible. Promptly remove and dispose of infected foliage to reduce pathogen inoculum. Control with pesticides (mostly preventive fungicides) is difficult, and modifying environmental conditions can be more effective.",

        "description": "The fungus can infect all species of white (five-needle) pines and usually kills infected trees. Hosts include foxtail, limber, singleleaf pinyon, sugar, western white, and whitebark pines. Initial symptoms include tiny, yellow spots and yellow mottling on pine needles, which later die and remain hanging on the tree. Infected branches swell into spindle-shaped galls. Infected bark develops raised blisters and becomes rough and cankered. A honey-colored ooze, then pustules of powdery orange spores develop on cankers in the spring. Infections are most common near the ground where humidity is highest. At sites with more fog, more of the cankers are higher in trees. On the pathogen's alternate hosts, currant and gooseberry (Ribes spp.), the fungus causes slightly raised, yellowish spots on the underside of leaves and young stems. The fungus needs two hosts to survive, spending part of its life on five-needled pines and the other on Ribes. Viable spores that infect pines originate from the alternate hosts, Ribes. Trees are infected through a windborne spore landing on a water droplet on a live needle fascicle, or group of pine needles. The spore germinates and infects the tree by growing through the base of needles to the inner bark. Once in the stem or branch, the pathogen causes canker formation, and eventually girdling, which kills the plant parts outward or upward from the canker. Infected pine foliage turns yellow, then brown and dies and remains hanging on the tree. Diseased tissue increasingly encircles (girdles) the infected limb or trunk and eventually kills it. Leaves of infected Ribes may drop prematurely. Ribes generally tolerate this damage. To avoid white pine blister rust, plant resistant or nonhost pine species. Cutting off infected limbs may increase tree longevity. Promptly remove seriously diseased or hazardous trees. Do not move Cronartium-infected pines or wood off-site because some parts of California are still free of this introduced pathogen. Removing alternate hosts of the fungus (Ribes spp.) within about 500 feet of high-value white pines may help to reduce infections if trees are relatively isolated from other white pines. Ribes removal is generally not recommended because of the extensive labor required. It is difficult to completely eliminate all the alternate host plants, and Ribes regrow rapidly from seed when the soil is disturbed mechanically or after fire. Fungicides have not been found to be effective in managing this disease.

Tools used to cut, inject, or prune infected elms spread the fungi to other elms. The fungi also spread from infected elms through natural root grafts to nearby elms.",
        "damage": "Dutch elm disease has killed several thousand elms in California, mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Sacramento. Millions of elms have been killed in midwestern and eastern states since 1930.",
        "solutions": "American and European elms are highly susceptible to the disease, which originally is from Asia. Plant elms that are resistant to Dutch elm disease and elm leaf beetle. Some of these trees also resist phloem necrosis (elm yellows), a phytoplasma not yet reported in California. Alternatively, plant hackberry (Celtis spp.), hornbeam (Carpinus spp.), or other species that resemble elms but are not attacked by elm pests. Most elm species and hybrids are adapted to summer rainfall. Maintain tree vigor by providing adequate summer irrigation in areas with summer drought. Report suspected Dutch elm disease to the county agricultural commissioner. Remove infected elms immediately to eliminate them as a source of the fungi, which otherwise will spread to nearby elms. Digging a trench around infected trees deep enough to cut the roots may prevent the fungi from spreading by natural root grafts to nearby elms. Pruning. Promptly prune off and dispose of dead and dying elm limbs as they commonly are infested with the fungus-spreading elm bark beetles and can pose a limb-drop (failure) hazard. Promptly pruning off recently diseased limbs may be a management method in areas where quarantine regulations do not require the removal of the entire tree. This \"therapeutic pruning\" can be effective only if done promptly during the first season when disease symptoms appear on a tree. For therapeutic pruning to potentially be effective, the trees must be otherwise healthy and vigorous. Symptoms must be limited to one or a few limbs, and at least 10 feet of healthy wood, free of visible disease streaking, must separate the infected wood from the pruning point on the main trunk. Be aware that unless tools are thoroughly cleaned and sterilized after contacting infected tissue, DED and other vascular wilt pathogens can be mechanically spread by unsterilized tools that contact internal parts of trees, such as tools used to prune trees or inject them with chemicals. Avoid unnecessary pruning. Properly prune elms when needed, especially when trees are young and preferably during late fall and winter. Bury, chip, or (where permitted) burn freshly cut elm wood. Alternatively, seal elm logs tightly under clear plastic in a sunny location through the warm season and for at least 7 months, after which they are no longer suitable for beetle breeding. Fungicides. No fungicides have been demonstrated to be effective against Dutch elm disease in California. Based on use in the eastern United States, injection of certain systemic fungicides by a competent, professional applicator may prevent DED and help some recently infected trees to survive if properly treated while less than 5 to 10% of their canopy is symptomatic. Consider fungicide treatment only if Dutch elm disease has been discovered infecting nearby elms. Do not use fungicide alone; it has limited effectiveness, and only when combined with proper pruning and tree care. If the main trunk or many limbs show symptoms, promptly remove the dying tree to reduce pathogen spread to nearby elms. The prompt detection and removal of dead and dying elms is the most effective method for managing the disease. See Dutch elm disease by the American Phytopathological Society and the U.S. Forest Service DED website for more information.",

        "description": "Clear, brownish, or frothy viscous liquid sometimes drips from acorns of coast live oak and interior live oak. Dripping acorns have been an intermittent problem from spring through fall in coastal areas and interior valleys of California, causing a sticky mess on surfaces beneath affected oaks. Drippy acorn, also called drippy nut, is caused by Brenneria (=Erwinia) quercina, a bacterium that infects wounds in oak tissue. Bacteria commonly enter acorns injured by filbert weevils or filbertworms and certain other insects. The B. quercina bacterium causes ooze from nuts and the acorn cap, including caps that remain attached after the nut has dropped. In addition to dripping from older acorns and caps, profuse dripping or frothy exudate sometimes occurs from very young or barely developed acorns, from distortions where young acorns would be expected to occur, and from leaves or twigs where there are no acorns. This dripping has been attributed to oviposition wounds from several species of oak gall wasps that allow infection by B. quercina bacteria. However, neither B. quercina or insects or their damage have been definitely associated with some situations where the cause of oak dripping is unknown. Dripping from oak canopies can also be caused by nectar-producing oak galls of certain cynipid wasps, including Andricus, Disholcaspis, and Dryocosmus species. Aphids, oak leaf phylloxera, scale insects, whiteflies, woolly aphids, and other honeydew-excreting insects can also cause sticky liquid to drip from oaks. Liquid dripping from trees and onto surfaces beneath can be annoying and unpleasant. However, the malady apparently does not threaten tree health. No methods have been demonstrated to be effective in controlling bacterial-associated dripping from oaks. Fortunately, the malady is sporadic and does not occur every year. Where dripping is a problem, wash fouled surfaces regularly while dripping is relatively recent and easier to remove. Pruning branches to reduce canopy overhang in sensitive areas (e.g., driveways, patios) can reduce potential dripping. However, extensive pruning or removing large limbs wounds trees and allows entry of decay organisms that can weaken trees and contribute to their premature death. Pruning may not be an appropriate response to this temporary, aesthetic problem. For more information see A Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of California Oaks.

        "description": "Phytoplasmas, formerly called mycoplasmas, are minute, single-cell organisms that resemble bacteria. Phytoplasma diseases are often called yellows because chlorotic foliage is a common damage symptom. Yellows of ash, elm, and lilacs and lethal yellowing of palm are important phytoplasma diseases that so far have been reported only in the eastern United States. Aster yellows complex is the most important phytoplasma infecting herbaceous ornamentals in California, but not woody plants. Phytoplasmas commonly cause distorted, dwarfed, and yellowish leaves and shoots. Other symptoms include abnormal flower and leaf development, shortened internodes, and shoot proliferation (witches\u2019 broom). The flowers of infected plants sometimes develop green, leaflike structures, called phyllody. Phytoplasma diseases in California include peach yellow leafroll of almonds, nectarines, and peaches; pear decline of pear; and cherry buckskin, or X-disease of cherry. Phytoplasma infection gives fruit a bitter flavor and abnormal appearance and causes trees to decline. The symptoms of phytoplasmas can be confused with those caused by viruses. Some phytoplasmas cause severe decline and eventually death of the plant. Many phytoplasmas are poorly known, and their importance as pests may be underestimated. Phytoplasmas are often spread during feeding by certain species of leafhoppers. Pear decline is vectored by a psyllid, the pear psylla. The insects acquire phytoplasma during their sucking feeding on infected hosts, then spread the microorganism when they move to feed on other host plants. No chemicals are effective against phytoplasmas. Control these pathogens primarily through proper sanitation, excluding and controlling insect vectors, and using only pathogen-free stock. Remove infected plants that are a source of pathogens, including certain weeds. For example, burclover (Medicago polymorpha), clovers (Melilotus and Trifolium spp.), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) host the X-disease phytoplasma spread by certain leafhoppers. Scion and rootstock cultivars often vary significantly in their susceptibility to phytoplasmas. Seek information on resistant cultivars and plant them where phytoplasmas are a problem.",

Oaks, for example, commonly develop witches' brooms after spring weather is cool and moist and in coastal areas where fog occurs during the growing season. The witches' brooms become apparent on oak terminals by late spring or early summer. Rose rosette disease that causes witches' broom in roses is caused by an RNA virus in the genus Emaravirus. The virus is spread by a rose-feeding, wind-transported eriophyid mite, Phyllocoptes fructiphilus. This virus is common in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains but in California has only been reported in the Fresno area. Most rose viruses do not threaten plant survival; they only slow plant growth and mar the aesthetic appearance. Rose rosette virus, however, generally kills infected hosts. Provide plants with proper cultural care and a good growing environment to keep them vigorous. Where they are aesthetically objectionable, prune out witches' brooms at least several inches below where they form. This is commonly the only available management strategy, such as for most fasciations and western gall rust. Removing affected roses and replanting using clean plants is the only management likely to be effective for rose rosette disease. Infected roses cannot be cured. Control of the eriophyid mite vector of this virus can reduce the risk of the pathogen spreading to uninfected roses. But good control of eriophyids using miticides is difficult to achieve in most gardens and landscapes.

        "description": "The fungus infects branches and trunks of two- and three-needle pines. Hosts include Aleppo, Bishop, lodgepole, Monterey, ponderosa, Scots, and shore pines. Often infections are within 10 to 20 feet from the ground. Galled stems may exude sap. Galls sometimes become colonized by other fungi or insects or chewed by small mammals. Beyond the galls, foliage may become stunted and bushy, and the terminal may die back or break off. Flagging of branch terminals (needles dying and turning brown) resembles damage from pitch canker infection and certain insects (e.g., twig-feeding beetles). Western gall rust infection can readily be distinguished from other diseases and insect damage by the presence of the galls, when young each 2 to 3 inches in diameter, near the dead terminals. In spring, young galls develop orange spores on their surface. The spores are spread from pine to pine by wind and if shoots are wet infect the terminals of the youngest branches or the mainstem terminal. Needles do not become infected. The fungal germ tube (outgrowth of a spore) directly penetrates the host cuticle and epidermal cells to develop a perennial infection in living tissue. Infection of the cambium stimulates gall formation. The fungus can remain alive as long as the infected host tissue lives, which may be from a few to many years on branches to the life of a long-lived tree for basal mainstem infections. The fungus causes spherical swellings or galls, cankers, and dieback on branches in two- and three-needle pines. Some pines develop rust infection at the base of their mainstem. These trees if they live to an old age can develop a large depression on one side the lower trunk, called a hip canker. Prune and dispose of infected branches during October to January. Large galls on major limbs or the trunk can lead to structural failure; consider removing and replacing trees that may be hazardous.

        "description": "Viruses are submicroscopic pathogens that infect cells, changing some cell functions. Abutilon, camellia, Nandina (heavenly bamboo), rose, wisteria and many other woody landscape plants may show viral symptoms on occasion. Viral pathogens are named after the main or first-recognized host plant and the primary type of damage they cause. For example, Apple mosaic virus and Elm mosaic virus cause an irregular pattern of discoloration in leaves on apple and elm, respectively. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot and Prunus necrotic ringspot cause small yellow or brownish spots or blotches on the leaves of hibiscus or plants in the rose family, respectively. Viruses can be transmitted by insects feeding on plant sap or mechanically in sap that is spread by hand or grafting tools. Viruses also spread in pollen, seed, or vegetative parts of plants, such as through budding and grafting during propagation. Once a plant becomes infected with virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. Some viruses have a relatively narrow host range and apparently infect only one genus of plants. Other viruses have a broad host range, such as Impatiens necrotic spot virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus, incompletely understood tospoviruses that infect several hundred genera of mostly herbaceous plants, including many flowering ornamentals. Viruses can slow plant growth, but most do not seriously harm woody landscape plants. Herbaceous ornamentals and certain vegetables are more susceptible to serious injury or death from viruses. The variegation or other appearance changes that viruses cause are sometimes considered to be attractive, such as Abutilon mosaic virus. There is no cure or treatment for virus-infected plants in landscapes, and generally none is needed for woody ornamentals. Provide proper cultural care to improve plant vigor or replace infected plants if their growth is unsatisfactory. Purchase and plant only high-quality, certified virus-free or virus-resistant nursery stock or seeds. Do not graft virus-infected plant parts onto virus-free plants unless you want to introduce the virus. Although certain viruses are spread by aphids and other insects that suck plant juices, controlling insects is generally not a recommended or effective method of preventing virus infection in woody landscapes. It is very difficult to detect or control insects effectively at the low densities that can spread a virus, and to continually provide control throughout the life of perennial plants, especially of insects like the melon and green peach aphids that spread Cucumber mosaic virus in Nandina and feed on many different plant species.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/DISEASES/vertwilt.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Many deciduous trees and shrubs are susceptible to infection by Verticillium dahliae. Hosts include ash, box elder, camphor, catalpa, Chinese pistache, coral tree, dracaena, dodonaea, elm, fuchsia, hebe, Indian hawthorn, maple, mayten, olive, pepper tree, redbud, rose, syringa, and tulip tree. Various flowering herbaceous plants and garden vegetables are also susceptible to Verticillium wilt. Flower hosts include chrysanthemum, dahlia, geranium, gerbera daisy, impatiens, Marguerite daisy, marigold, peony, petunia, snapdragon, sunflower, and vinca. Vegetable hosts include brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, cantaloupe, cucumber, pumpkin, squash, watermelon, eggplant, pepper, potato, and tomato. Verticillium wilt is a fungal disease that damages a plant's vascular system. It causes foliage to turn faded green, yellow, or brown and wilt in scattered portions of the canopy or on scattered branches. Shoots and branches die, often beginning on one side of the plant, and entire plants may die. Small plants may die from Verticillium wilt in a single season, but larger plants usually decline more slowly. Mature trees may take many years to die and may suddenly recover if conditions become favorable for plant growth and poor for disease development. Symptoms of Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt can be indistinguishable. Determining which is the cause of damage may require submitting samples to a plant diagnostic laboratory that cultures the fungus for positive identification. Verticillium persists as microsclerotia in soil. When soil is cool, microsclerotia produce hyphae (vegetative growth structures) that infect roots of susceptible hosts. The pathogen then spreads upward in the current year\u2019s growth and inhibits the plant\u2019s nutrient and water transport. In some plants, but not all (e.g., olive), peeling off the bark on newly infected branches may reveal dark streaks following the wood grain. Depending on the plant species, the stains are dark black, brownish, gray, or greenish. Infection can occur during the spring but not become apparent until warm weather when plants are more water stressed. Keep plants vigorous by providing them a good growing environment and proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation. Applying modest amounts of slow-release fertilizer to promote new growth can increase infected plants\u2019 likelihood of survival. If chronic branch dieback develops, prune off any dead wood and have an arborist certified by the International Society of Arboriculture or registered with the American Society of Consulting Arborists inspect trees for possible hazards (e.g., risk of limb drop). Trees affected by Verticillium wilt may need to be removed. Where Verticillium wilt has been a problem, plant only resistant species because the pathogen persists in soil. For example \"FNV\" on a plant label means the plant is resistant to Fusarium (F), nematodes (N), and Verticillium (V). Before replanting, soil solarization during the summer then keeping the site plant free for at least 1 year can help reduce pathogen inoculum in soil and improve the establishment and growth of subsequent plantings.

Mites cause blistered leaves or galled twigs and occur in yellow to orange felty masses in depressions on the underside of blistered leaves. No felty masses of mites are found on the undersides of leaves infected with Taphrina spp. However, Taphrina produce masses of pale spores on leaf surfaces that resemble the felty mass caused by erineum mites. Taphrina spores (asci) can occur on either leaf surface; the felty colonies of erineum mites usually occur only on the underside of oak leaves. Microscopic examination may be required to distinguish confidently between erineum mites and Taphrina spores. The minute eriophyid mites are about 1/50 inch long, about one-fourth the size of spider mites, and a 15 to 20\u00d7 hand lens or preferably a binocular dissecting microscope is needed to distinguish them and determine whether eriophyid mites are present.",

        "description": "These fungi are named for the dry to gelatinous, orange, reddish, or yellowish fruiting bodies and spore masses that many species form on infected tissue. Rusts infect many hosts, including birch, cedar, cottonwood, cypress, fuchsia, hawthorn, juniper, pear, pine, poplar, rhododendron, and rose. Rust fungi and their damage usually occur on fruit, green stems, and leaves of broadleaf plants or on the bark or needles of conifers. The host species and characteristics of the damage and fungal fruiting bodies and spores are used to identify rusts. Many species of rust have four or five types of fungal spores that differ in appearance and the time of year when they are present. Chrysanthemum rusts and rose rust cause discolored spots on leaves, which may drop prematurely. Gymnosporangium rusts on cedar, cypress, and juniper cause bunchy shoot growth (witches' brooms) and colorful raised growths or spots on foliage. On their alternate hosts in the rose family, Gymnosporangium rusts primarily cause leaf spots, but on pear sporadically damage fruit. Pine rusts may discolor only the leaves or needles, cause symptoms mostly on bark, or affect both bark and foliage depending on the species of host plant and rust fungus. Western gall rust and white pine blister rust cause cankers, galls, ooze, and roughening on bark. Foliage outward or upward from infected bark can become yellowish, then brown or reddish and drop prematurely. Rusts infect hosts when plant surfaces are wet and temperatures are mild, mostly during the fall to spring or almost any time of the year in coastal locations. Rust fungi are spread primarily by windblown spores and when infected plants (e.g., from a nursery) are moved. Each species of rust is specific to certain hosts. Most species of rust fungi have several different-looking life stages and complex life cycles, alternating generations between two hosts in different plant families. Others, such as rose rust, Phragmidium mucronatum, and western gall rust are restricted to one host genus and spread, respectively, from rose to rose or pine to pine. Infected foliage on broadleaf hosts may become spotted, turn yellow or brown overall, and drop prematurely. Infected conifers may develop bushy growth (e.g., witches' brooms), cankered, galled, and oozing bark and limbs, and spotted needles. Many rusts have minimal affect on plant health, but certain rusts can kill their hosts. The importance of rust damage varies greatly, such as depending on local environmental conditions and the abundance and nearness of other hosts that are sources of infectious spores. Avoid overhead watering. Collect fallen, infected leaves and needles and dispose of them away from host plants. Cut off and dispose of diseased shoots and branches as soon as they appear, except do not prune woody parts so extensively that plants are seriously damaged. Removing nearby alternate hosts of the fungus may help to reduce new infections in certain situations. Healthy Roses Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders",

        "description": "Rose mosaic virus may be a complex of more than one pathogen including Apple mosaic virus and Prunus necrotic ringspot virus. Virus infection causes yellow, white, or brownish lines, bands, rings, vein clearing or yellowing, oak-leaf patterns, or blotches on leaves. Sometimes only a portion of the plant is affected. Roses can also be infected by other viruses. A group of diseases that mimic some of the symptoms of Rose mosaic virus include rose spring dwarf and rose leaf curl. Rose mosaic virus and most other rose viruses are not spread by insects or pruning tools. They infect roses through budding, grafting, or rooting cuttings from infected plants. Roses infected during propagation can be symptomless until after they are planted and begin growing in landscapes. Once a plant becomes infected with virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. Virus-infected plants may grow more slowly, produce delayed or fewer flowers, and become more susceptible to frost damage. The severity of damage varies with the host cultivar. Some infected roses exhibit no damage symptoms. There is no cure or treatment in landscapes for eliminating the viruses that cause rose mosaic disease. Replace infected roses if their performance is unsatisfactory. Purchase and plant virus-indexed plants, roses that have been tested and certified to be free of known rose viruses.

        "description": "Rose flowers sometimes develop green, leaflike structures. This uncommon abnormality is called phyllody. Certain rose varieties (e.g., floribundas) more often develop phyllody. Green, vegetativelike structures develop where rose flower parts such as pistils and stamens normally occur. When roses have both normal and abnormal flowers but foliage growth and color look healthy, the cause is probably abiotic, due to adverse environmental conditions. When mild weather returns, the subsequent flowers should develop normally if the cause of phyllody is abiotic. Phytoplasmas and viruses can also cause phyllody in many plant species, but not commonly in roses. If phyllody occurs on roses with stunted growth or foliage that is yellow or otherwise unhealthy, a phytoplasma or virus may be the cause. Phyllody apparently is due to a plant hormone imbalance when flower buds are forming. In roses, usually hot weather or drought stress during flower bud formation are the cause of hormone imbalance. Infection by phytoplasmas or viruses can also disrupt plant hormones in roses and affect flower appearance. Because these pathogens typically alter foliage appearance, whether or not leaves appear healthy indicates whether the cause of phyllody is abiotic or pathogenic microorganisms. Phyllody does not seriously harm plants. The atypical appearance of blossoms can be aesthetically undesirable. Phyllody in Roses (PDF) Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders",

        "description": "Several dozen species of native or introduced rust fungi attack conifers in California. Western gall rust and white pine blister rust are important canker and gall diseases, but most pine rusts are usually of minor importance. The host species and characteristics of the damage and fungal spores are used to identify rusts. Needle rusts. Coleosporium spp. and others cause brown, reddish, or yellow bands or spots on needles. Needles often turn brown or yellow and develop tiny, pale or dark spore-forming bodies, usually in winter or spring. Most Coleosporium spp. affect only the youngest needles and sporadically so during years when abundant rainfall coincides with new growth. Aster rust, Coleosporium asterum =C. solidaginis, is one of the most common pine needle rusts. It is found mostly on the foliage of lodgepole pine and its alternate hosts. Stalactiform rust. Peridermium stalactiforme causes rough bark (blisters) and cankers mostly on the lower branches and lower trunk of yellow (two- or three-needle) pines, including Jeffrey, lodgepole, and ponderosa pines. On the alternate hosts, stalactiform rust causes discolored blotches and orangish spores on leaves. To complete their life cycles, most rusts must alternate between the pine and a host in a different plant family. An exception is western gall rust, which spreads from pine to pine. The aster rust alternate hosts are asters and goldenrods (Asteraceae). The alternate hosts of stalactiform rust are figworts (Scrophulariaceae), especially Indian paintbrush, Castilleja spp. Most rust fungi have four or five types of spores, which appear in a definite succession. The pycniospore and aeciospore are usually produced on the conifer needle. The urediospore (or uredospore), teliospore, and basidiospore are produced on the alternate hosts. The fruiting (spore-forming) structure of the fungus occurs below the cuticle or epidermis, or in blisters or fungal tissue covering the host tissue. The infective spores are windborne to the alternate host, where they germinate, penetrate the leaf tissue, and cause disease. Needle rusts occur only sporadically in landscapes and forests. Damage to pines is usually negligible, except in nurseries and Christmas tree plantations. Most outbreaks involve a single season, and then years may pass with no new infections occurring. Stalactiform rust causes trunk cankers, which can kill trees by girdling. Tree death is uncommon except in seedlings or where two or more cankers coalesce. Infected branches are occasionally killed, but this usually has no significant affect on the growth of otherwise healthy trees. An interaction of host, pathogen, and environmental factors determines rust outbreaks. Although unsightly, most rusts usually do not seriously harm their hosts. Preventing pine rust damage is difficult or infeasible in many situations. See western gall rust and white pine blister rust for management of these important diseases.

Diplodia quercina kills small branches (usually those less than 1 inch, but up to 4 inches in diameter), causing leaves to turn brown, wilt, die, and remain attached in the canopy. Oak branch dieback outbreaks follow years of below-average rainfall. Diplodia corticola (named Botryosphaeria corticola during its sexual stage) causes crown thinning (leaves that are pale and smaller and less abundant than normal) and bark bleeding, cracking, and staining on the main trunk of coast live oak in southern California. Trunk symptoms of D. corticola infection (called bot canker) resemble damage caused by goldspotted oak borer. Disease caused by Diplodia spp. often can be distinguished by the masses of tiny, roundish, raised, black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) on bark of infected hosts. Peeling off bark around fruiting bodies and cankers reveals dark brown to black dead wood, commonly with a well-defined border between dark diseased and light-colored healthy wood.",

The specific amount and frequency of irrigation vary greatly, depending on factors such as environmental and soil conditions. Be aware that frequent irrigation during the dry season promotes Armillaria root disease (oak root fungus) and Phytophthora root and crown rot. Protect trees from other pests and injury and provide proper cultural care. No other specific management is known for D. corticola.

Unless they were raised with irrigation (e.g., planted oaks), avoid irrigating native oaks during the dry season; irrigate during the winter, if needed, when rainfall has been below normal. Avoid applying fertilizer, which can favor excessive shoot growth, leading to a denser, slower-drying canopy more susceptible to these diseases. Pruning may help to control the disease, but this may be feasible only for a few small or specimen trees with limited infections. Prune infected twigs during dry weather in the summer or early fall; make cuts properly in healthy tissue below infected twigs. Some systemic fungicides provide control if applied within 1 week after pruning. Fungicides alone are not as effective. Dead twigs and leaves remain on the tree, and the tree's appearance does not improve until these drop or are pruned out. Other pathogens and certain insects cause similar damage, so correctly determine the cause before attempting any control.",

Cercospora needle blight, Cercospora sequoiae, affects coast redwood after warm, wet conditions. Elytroderma disease caused by Elytroderma deformans affects only pines, commonly those grown alongside lakes and streams. Unlike other needle cast fungi that develop in foliage, Elytroderma infection becomes systemic and persists in branch tissue, and it can seriously damage pines. All conifers are susceptible to brown felt blight, or \"snow mold.\" Needles buried under snow die in dark brown to gray masses matted together with fungal mycelium. Brown felt blight of pines is caused by Neopeckia (=Herpotrichia) coulteri. In other conifers, Herpotrichia juniperi (=H. nigra) causes brown felt blight.",
        "life_cycle": "These fungi often have life cycles that are timed with the growth and development of the host and may require 1, 2, or more years to complete. Sporulation, spread, and infection by these fungi are frequently restricted to a specific season, such as spring, summer, or fall. Successful infection depends on favorable conditions. For example, in some needle casts, infection is frequently restricted to the newly developing needles, and sporulation is timed to coincide in spring with needle development.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "To minimize needle blights, choose a planting site with good air circulation and avoid planting conifers too close together. Provide appropriate cultural care to encourage vigorous plant growth. When irrigating, use drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinkling and avoid irrigating in the late afternoon or evening. Generally, no other management is practical or necessary.",

        "description": "Many woody species are susceptible to coral spot fungus (Nectria cinnabarina), European canker (N. galligena), and other Nectria spp. Cankered limbs are more susceptible to breakage and may be hazardous.",
        "identification": "Nectria spp. infection of branches and twigs causes leaves and shoots to wilt, often beginning in spring. Infected branches and twigs may die back and cankers (discolored, sunken, often elliptical areas) commonly develop in woody parts. Nectria spp. infection is often overlooked until clusters of the fungal fruiting bodies erupt from bark, usually during spring and summer. Each of these spherical orange or red sporodochia and perithecia (the coral spots) are about 1/50 to 1/16 inch in diameter and later turn pale or become covered with white spores. Where these fungal growths occur, cutting away bark reveals a margin separating dead (dark brown, necrotic) and healthy (cream-colored) wood. The green, living cambial layer found just beneath healthy bark is absent where cankers occur. There are many other common causes of cankers, including other species of canker fungi.",
        "life_cycle": "Nectria fungi infect woody species through weakened or wounded tissue, such as leaf scars and pruning wounds. Plants are especially susceptible to infection when unhealthy or stressed, such as from recent planting. Plants infected when young may die, but Nectria spp. rarely, if ever, kill older plants. Callous tissue developing around wounds often limits canker spread and prevents girdling of the trunk or limbs.",

        "solutions": "Proper cultural care and good growing conditions are the most important management methods. Plant only species well adapted to local conditions and especially provide appropriate irrigation. Avoid wounding or pruning plants, especially if they are growing poorly. Unless pruning must be seasonally timed to avoid other problems, prune if needed during early summer to reduce the likelihood of Nectria infections. No fungicides cure Nectria infections. If plants are heavily infected or susceptible species are newly planted, the frequency of new infections may be reduced by thoroughly spraying a fixed copper or a freshly prepared Bordeaux mixture during early leaf drop, just before the rainy weather. If leaf fall is prolonged by warm fall weather, a second application may be warranted when three-fourths of leaves have dropped.",

        "description": "In California, at least two viruses occur in heavenly bamboo, Nandina domestica. The Cucumber mosaic virus and Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (formerly Nandina mosaic virus) mostly cause a mottled red discoloration of heavenly bamboo leaves. Leaf reddening in heavenly bamboo can also be due to other causes such as high light intensity. Cucumber mosaic virus infection causes wine red discoloration of new spring growth in nandina. Leaves may be thinner (more narrow in width) than normal and cupped downward. There may be fewer flower buds and berries on infected plants. Plantago asiatica mosaic virus causes a relatively mild mosaic; the reddening of foliage may not be very intense or extensive. There may be stunting and leaf distortion of infected Nandina. Plantago asiatica mosaic virus spreads mechanically during propagation and pruning. The virus can be introduced into plants on cutting tools contaminated with sap from an infected plant. Cucumber mosaic virus, infects a variety of agricultural and ornamental plants and annual and perennial weeds. It can be transmitted mechanically. In the field, Cucumber mosaic virus is often spread by aphids, especially the melon aphid, Aphis gossypii, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Aphids acquire the virus while feeding on infected plants and transmit it when they move and feed on other plants. Once a plant becomes infected with the virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. There is no cure or treatment for virus-infected plants in landscapes. Replace affected plants if their performance is unsatisfactory. Purchase and plant only Nandina that has been virus-tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

        "description": "In landscapes in forested areas, several host-specific strains of Heterobasidion annosum can infect almost any native conifer. Certain broadleaves are uncommonly infected, including almond, apple, madrone, maple, oak, and poplar. Also called Annosus root and butt rot, the disease kills the basal trunk, root crown, and roots of infected hosts. Hosts commonly show no aboveground symptoms for 1 year or more after they are infected. More than one-half of the root system of a tree may be killed before aboveground symptoms become apparent. Dying trees will have browning and yellowing foliage, needles growing in tufts, undersized foliage, and reddish to purplish, discolored bark. Diseased hosts are highly susceptible to being blown over by wind. In pines, major indications of Heterobasidion root disease are bark that separates easily from the wood of recently dead roots and silvery white flecks of fungus present at the interface between bark and wood. In firs and certain other hosts, a stringy white rot beneath bark and the presence of fruiting bodies are the most important signs of disease presence. The fungus produces button-shaped, white fruiting bodies about 1/2 inch wide. Other of its fruiting bodies are leathery, several inches wide, and bracket shaped, seashell shaped, or irregular. The upper surface of these larger conks is blackish, brown, or reddish with a white margin. The lower surface is cream colored or white. These perennial fruiting bodies commonly envelop needles and debris near the ground as they grow, a characteristic feature of this fungus. The fungus spreads by airborne spores that infect wounds around the trunk base and especially freshly cut stumps. If plants of the same species grow near each other they can naturally form root grafts through which Heterobasidion can spread from plant to plant. Groups of hosts often die in a gradually expanding clump as they are infected through root contact with the initial host. The fungus can survive for several decades in the roots of killed trees. The pathogen infects and kills the basal trunk, roots, and root crown of conifers and occasionally certain hardwoods. Pines and true firs are often killed within several years of their initial infection. Hosts such as Douglas-fir, hemlock, incense-cedar, larch, and spruce are not commonly killed outright, but their heartwood and sapwood decay, increasing the likelihood of insect attack (e.g., bark beetles) and tree failure (e.g., tipping trunk, wind breakage). Infected trees cannot be cured. Prevention is the only effective management strategy. Avoid wounding trees, especially near the soil line. Promptly cut down dying and dead conifers. Apply a registered borate fungicide such as Tim-Bor to freshly cut pine and true fir stumps and perhaps to stumps of other conifers. This prevents Heterobasidion spores from infecting stumps and spreading the fungus to nearby hosts through root grafts. See Heterobasidion annosum from North Carolina State University and Pests of the Native California Conifers from the University of California for more information.

        "description": "Various host-specific forms of Fusarium oxysporum can kill infected plants. Susceptible woody ornamentals include albizia (mimosa), certain cacti (e.g., prickly pear and saguaro), date palm, hebe, and pyracantha. Herbaceous ornamental hosts include aster, carnation, chrysanthemum, cyclamen, daffodil, dahlia, freesia, and gladiolus. Other hosts include asparagus, bean, cabbage, cantaloupe, pea, tomato, and watermelon. Symptoms commonly appear first on one side of a plant. Fusarium wilt causes foliage to yellow, wilt, then turn brown and die. Older leaves generally discolor, wilt, and die first, followed by death of the entire plant. Cutting into infected vascular tissue (e.g., wood xylem) can reveal that conducting tissue has turned brown, commonly all the way from the terminal shoot to the soil line. Cross-sections of basal stems may reveal brown rings. Masses of spore-bearing stalks are sometimes visible on dead tissue and may look like small pink cushions. Symptoms of Fusarium wilt and Verticillium wilt can be indistinguishable. Determining which is the cause of damage may require submitting samples to a plant diagnostic laboratory that cultures the fungus for positive identification. Fusarium hyphae (vegetative growth structures) germinate from long-lasting survival structures (chlamydospores) in the soil. The fungus infects plants through rootlets. It invades the xylem and eventually spreads throughout the plant's vascular system. Pathogen spread within and between plants is favored by warm temperatures. Fusarium has many special forms (called forma specialis, or f. sp.) or subspecies, each specific to certain plant hosts. Fusarium does not spread from one host to infect plants in other genera. However, those other genera may be susceptible to different Fusarium f. sp. Most forms of F. oxysporum attack only herbaceous ornamentals and vegetable crops. There is no effective fungicide or other cure for Fusarium wilt. The pathogen nearly always kills infected hosts. Prevention and exclusion are the only effective management strategies. Avoid this problem by replanting at that site using species from different genera than plants previously infected there by Fusarium. Fusarium propagules persist in soil and will cause disease if the same plant genus is replanted at that site. Grow cultivars resistant to Fusarium if available for that plant species. For example \"FNV\" on a plant label means the plant is resistant to Fusarium (F), nematodes (N), and Verticillium (V). Obtain new plants from a reliable, high-quality source. Avoid planting in poorly drained soil; planting on mounds or raised beds is one remedy for this. Provide plants a good growing environment and proper cultural care. Especially do not overirrigate as this encourages shallow, surface rooting and shallow roots are more easily wounded and infected. Avoid using undecayed organic amendments around Fusarium hosts. Avoid excessive fertilization especially with urea, which may promote development of Fusarium wilt. Keep mulch, other debris, and other plants away from the base of hosts, especially palms, because nearby plants and their management can wound palm roots. Promptly remove and dispose of Fusarium-infected plants to reduce pathogen spread to nearby hosts. Soil solarization before planting may be effective in reducing or delaying infection of subsequently planted hosts.

        "description": "Rosellinia species fungi, most commonly R. necatrix, cause Dematophora or Rosellinia root rot, also called white root rot. Although relatively uncommon in landscapes, when it occurs it quickly kills hosts. Foliage symptoms as described below are generally the first clue that a root disease is present. Rosellinia also produces cobwebby mycelia that may be visible on the lower trunk, in soil over infected roots, growing from infected roots, or beneath bark of the root crown and major roots. These whitish growths of Rosellinia are much smaller and more scattered in comparison with the fanlike mycelia of Armillaria root disease found under bark. Mycelia of Rosellinia also lack the characteristic mushroomlike odor produced by fresh mycelia of Armillaria. In comparison, Phytophthora root rot produces no whitish mycelia. When Rosellinia root rot is the cause of disease, exposing roots and removing the cortex (outer layer) of infected roots will reveal a whitish, fluffy layer of fungal mycelia. Older mycelia of Rosellinia can become blackish, brown, or tan and may occur crustlike on dead roots or the root crown. Dark cankers may be present in the lower trunk and main roots of infected hosts. When Rosellinia-infected bark or root pieces are sealed in a moist chamber such as a plastic bag or jar for a few days, abundant, white mycelia are produced. Tiny, stalked spore-forming structures (coremia) with fluffy white growths on the end may also be produced and visible with a hand lens. If Rosellinia root rot is suspected, it may be best to quickly seek an expert to confirm its presence. Prompt removal of the infested host may be warranted before the fungus spreads to nearby hosts. The fungus lives as mycelia in roots of infected plants. Rosellinia can also persist in soil for several years in dried pieces of infected bark and wood. When the soil is moist and especially if soggy and of moderate temperature, the mycelia grow from infected roots and spread through the soil. If mycelia contact healthy roots of a host, they penetrate them and cause infection. Once inside a root the fungus spreads throughout the entire root system. Infected roots die rapidly. If plants of the same species grow near each other they may naturally form root grafts through which R. necatrix can spread from plant to plant. Over 300 species of woody plants can be infected by Rosellinia species. Hosts include apple, avocado, ceanothus, cotoneaster, holly, pear, poplar, privet, and viburnum. Note that cause of Rosellinia root rot in avocado is Rosellinia bunodes. See Fungal Databases from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of Rosellinia hosts. Aboveground symptoms of Rosellinia root rot are the same as those of various other root and crown rots including Armillaria root disease and Phytophthora root rot. Root rot initially causes foliage yellowing and wilting throughout the entire plant or in just a portion of the canopy. Leaves are undersized and sparse. Branches that are killed often retain dry foliage. Hosts generally die relatively quickly when infected with R. necatrix. There are no effective fungicides or other cure for hosts infected with R. necatrix. Prevention is the only available management strategy. Obtain high-quality nursery stock that is pathogen-free from a reputable source. Minimize the likelihood of Rosellinia root rot by preparing the site well before planting. Good soil drainage and appropriate irrigation are especially important. For example, if soil drains poorly, plant on soil mounds or raised beds. Provide established plants a good growing environment and proper cultural care. Especially avoid excess irrigation and aeration deficit, or waterlogging (soggy soil). If a plant died from Rosellinia root rot, uproot and dispose of it. If the same species grows nearby, trench around the infested site to break any root grafts that can naturally form between the same species growing near each other. Before replanting, remove as many root pieces from soil as possible. Establish a dry (unirrigated) zone where the Rosellinia-killed plant grew and prevent soil movement or water runoff from the infested site. Do not replant the site with hosts of R. necatrix.

Avoid planting susceptible cypress in warm areas. Grow species that are resistant or not susceptible. Poplar hybrids that show some resistance to Cytospora include Easter, Mighty Mo, Nor, and Platte. If cankers are limited to one or a few limbs, during the growing season, remove (cut out) cankers and destroy dead or damaged wood. Pruning during the growing season allows you to better identify branches with cankers. To ensure that all the disease is removed, cut several inches to one foot below any canker symptoms into healthy wood. Check the cut surface of damaged limbs to ensure that all the disease has been removed. Incomplete canker removal wastes time and is little to no benefit in disease management.",

Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes galling principally on the basal stem and root crown, at the soil line or just below the surface. Galls sometimes also develop on limbs, trunks, and roots.

However, when cut with a knife, crown galls are softer than normal wood and lack the typical pattern of annual growth rings. Galls can be tiny and smooth on young plants but usually are rough and sometimes massive on older trees.",
        "life_cycle": "The bacteria reproduce in galled tissue and may slough off and survive in soil for long periods. Bacteria in soil enter plants through wounds, commonly caused during handling in the nursery or when transplanting. The bacteria can also infect newly emerging roots, growth cracks, and wounds caused by sucker removal or string trimmers or other equipment.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Where crown gall has been a problem, plant resistant species, including birch, cedar, coast redwood, holly, incense cedar, magnolia, pine, spruce, tulip tree, and zelkova. Purchase and plant only high-quality nursery stock and avoid injuring trees, especially around the soil line. Dipping seeds or roots in the nursery in a solution of the biological control agents K-84 or K-1026 [nonpathogenic strains of A. tumefaciens (=A. radiobacter)] may reduce infections by most strains of pathogenic crown gall bacteria but not the strain commonly affecting grape. Solarization, covering moist, bare soil with clear plastic for 4 to 6 weeks during the sunny, dry season before planting may reduce crown gall bacteria in the upper soil. Galls can be removed by cutting into healthy wood around galls and exposing the tissue to drying. Cut out galls only during the dry season and minimize the removal of healthy tissue. At least on certain fruit and nut trees, gall regrowth is frequently avoided by using a blowtorch to briefly heat and sterilize the edges where galls were removed. Do not burn or char tissue and use caution to avoid fire or injury. If galls encompass much of the crown area, cutting them out causes other problems or tree death. Replace extensively galled trees if their growth is unsatisfactory.",

The surface of cankers usually has little obvious callus growth along the margins and commonly appears sunken, dark, and flattened, or covered with discolored or flaky bark. Black fruiting bodies may occur on the wound surface. Cutting into cankered cambium, phloem, and sapwood reveals dark discoloration, typically bluish black. When a dead branch or trunk is cut in cross-section, wood is often stained in a pie or wedge shape with the tip toward the center of the limb. Stained wood is not soft or rotted, but secondary pathogens may invade and cause wood decay.",
        "life_cycle": "No insect vectors of this fungus are definitely known in the United States. Infections at new locations are almost always the result of pruning or other mechanical injuries to trees caused by people. Ceratocystis produces sticky spores that remain infective for a month or more. Spores spread readily from one tree to another on tools or equipment, including pruning saws that contact infected trees. The fungus also may spread through natural root grafts from infected sycamores to nearby hosts.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Good sanitation and proper cultural practices are the only management methods. No chemicals effectively control this disease. If symptomatic trees are found in areas where the pathogen has not been reported, send samples of freshly infected wood to a diagnostic laboratory. Prevent injuries to bark from lawn mowers, string trimmers, and anything that wounds trunks or shallow roots. Within several feet of trunks, keep soil bare or apply mulch to avoid the common problem of lawn mower blades or string trimmers scraping the root crown or basal trunk. Where turfgrass or ground covers grow under tree canopies, irrigate properly to encourage deeper root growth. Use relatively infrequent, deep watering when needed instead of frequent shallow sprinkling. Where the fungus is known or suspected to occur, after pruning any Platanus spp. or using equipment that impacts trees, immediately scrub tools clean with detergent and water and soak them in a 10 to 20% bleach solution. Avoid unnecessary pruning. Except to remove hazardous limbs or dead trees whenever they appear, prune only during dry weather in December and January, when the cold inhibits fungal development. Promptly remove infected trees and dispose of the wood away from other Platanus spp. Consider trenching at least 2 to 3 feet deep around stumps to eliminate any natural root grafts to nearby Platanus spp.\n",

        "description": "These fungi infect junipers in some urban areas and cedar, cypress, and juniper in cool, moist areas of their native growing range such as the Sierra Nevada. Rosaceous species alternate hosts of the fungi (e.g., pear and serviceberry) can also be infected. The most conspicuous symptom on conifers is the presence of dark green, tight bunches of shoot growth (witches' brooms) on perennially infected branches. The brooms are often scattered throughout the canopy of the tree or shrub. The largest and oldest brooms usually occur in the lower canopy. Some brooms can grow more than 3 feet in diameter. Small, round, reddish cushions that form on conifer needles in spring also indicate infection by Gymnosporangium spp. Later in the year, when these cushion-like, spore-forming bodies mature and become wet, they appear as orange, gelatinous masses. On the fruit, green stems, and leaves of the rosaceous species alternate hosts, groups of small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies containing orange fungal spores appear as pustules and are symptomatic of infection. Certain mistletoes could be confused with the witches' brooms caused by Gymnosporangium rusts. For example, Phoradendron juniperinum =P. libocedri, infects incense cedar and junipers; when viewed from a distance it resembles brooms caused by Gymnosporangium rusts. The mistletoe is distinguished by the presence of leafless, green shoots growing in rounded, clusters. The mistletoe's green shoots appear to be leafless because its leaves are only 1/10 inch long and lie scalelike along stems. Gymnosporangium spp. require two hosts in different plant families to complete their life cycle. Most have four or five spore stages. The fungus on its conifer host produces spores in spring and summer. These spores disperse in air to infect the young tissues of the alternate host, a Rosaceae. The fungus grows in the alternate host and eventually produces airborne spores that infect the conifer host, usually in late summer or fall. Incense cedar rust, Gymnosporangium libocedri, also called cedar broom rust, alternates between incense cedar and mainly serviceberry, Amelanchier spp. Apple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, and quince are also alternate hosts. Gymnosporangium rusts cause galls, stunted and bushy branches (e.g., witches' brooms), stem dieback, and orange gelatinous spore masses on conifers. The damage usually has minimal effect on plant health. Young infected conifers are often deformed and sometimes die, but larger trees are seldom killed, even though some growth reduction and brooming occur. Only when trees are heavily infected or exhibit extensive brooms do they suffer growth reduction and mortality. The lumber quality is degraded in trees grown for harvest. On their rosaceous species alternate hosts (e.g., apple, hawthorn, and pear), Gymnosporangium rusts cause nonlethal swellings and colorful spots on fruit, leaves, and twigs. The rosaceous hosts usually suffer little damage. An exception is when pear fruit become infected and deformed by G. libocedri, a disease named pear rust, or Pacific coast pear rust. Prune and dispose of infected conifer twigs and limbs in the fall, before spores are produced in the spring. Remove galls by making cuts in healthy wood below swollen, infected tissue. Avoid overhead watering. Removing nearby alternate hosts of the fungus may help to reduce new infections. Consult Diseases of Pacific Coast Conifers (PDF) or Pests of the Native California Conifers for more information. ",

        "life_cycle": "Ciborinia camelliae produces dark, hard, irregular-shaped sclerotia at the base of infected flowers, where they replace the calyx lobe. Depending on the extent to which nearby sclerotia unite, they typically range in size from 1/12 to 1 inch. Sclerotia can lie dormant for several years on or near the soil surface. During winter and spring when camellias blossom, sclerotia produce light brown saucer-shaped apothecia (inverted mushroomlike bodies) about 1/5 to 3/4 inch in diameter. Apothecia forcibly discharge large numbers of spores that are carried by wind onto emerging blooms, where they germinate and infect flowers when they are wet. Pathogen development is favored by wet or humid conditions and mild temperatures (about 59\u00b0 to 70\u00b0F) during bloom. Outbreaks are initiated by sclerotia-infested soil received with new plants and by sclerotia persisting beneath established plants that have previously been infected. Sclerotia continue to produce apothecia for 3 to 5 years after being introduced into soil and the pathogen cannot be eradicated once present.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Prevention is the best control. Remove the top layer of potting soil when new plants are purchased and replace it with pathogen-free soil. Plant camellias in a well-ventilated location and avoid overhead irrigation. Pull off infected flowers as they appear and collect fallen blossoms and dispose of them in a covered location away from camellias. Do not add camellia petals or leaves to mulch that will be used around camellia, even if it has been composted. It is difficult to expose camellia debris to the 140\u00b0F required to kill all of the Ciborinia propagules by composting. Each year, when blossoms are no longer present, apply a fresh layer of pathogen-free organic mulch and maintain a 4-inch layer of organic mulch beneath and somewhat beyond plants to suppress pathogen spore production. Remove fallen petals and other camellia debris before applying fresh mulch, but otherwise avoid moving or disturbing existing mulch where fungi may be present. Keep mulch thin near the trunk or several inches away from the trunk. Spraying an appropriate fungicide during bloom can help to reduce infections. Depending on the fungicide, reapplication may be needed every 10 to 14 days while conditions remain suitable for the pathogen. Use fungicides only in conjunction with recommended sanitation and cultural practices.",

        "description": "Gray mold is named for the brown, gray, or tan fungal spores that develop on infected tissue when conditions are humid or moist. The tiny, stalked spore-forming structures give rotted tissues a fuzzy appearance when viewed with the naked eye. Various Botrytis and Botryotinia species cause gray mold, most commonly Botrytis cinerea. Disease often presents initially as tiny, almost translucent spots. These infected spots turn brown and appear water soaked. Infected fruit, leaves, petals, and succulent stems become dark, soft, and wilted and die. Succulent tissue of most plants is susceptible to Botrytis blight. Landscape hosts include azalea, bird of paradise, cacti, coast redwood, fuchsia, giant sequoia, hydrangea, rhododendron, and rose. Spores germinate and produce new infections only after plants have been continuously wet for 6 or more consecutive hours or when relative humidity has been higher than about 90% for 6 or more hours. In greenhouses or outdoors in coastal areas Botrytis and Botryotinia diseases can be a problem almost any time of year. Away from the coast, gray mold generally is a problem only during the late fall through early spring rainy season. However, Botrytis blight can occur anywhere plants are frequently wetted by overhead irrigation, especially those growing under crowded and shaded conditions where air circulation is poor. Azalea petal blight and rhododendron petal blight and camellia petal blight when these hosts are involved can resemble Botrytis blight. However, Botrytis blight is a drier rot that also affects dying or inactive green tissue. Azalea petal blight, camellia petal blight, and rhododendron petal blight infect and kill only blossoms. When humidity is high or plants are wet for at least 6 hours, declining or dying, soft tissues can become infected by airborne spores of Botrytis and Botryotinia species. Healthy, actively growing green plant parts are seldom infected directly by these fungi. However, once petals or dead or weakened tissues are infected the fungus can move to invade adjacent, healthy green tissue that contacts diseased tissues. Gray mold fungi do not infect woody parts. Botrytis and Botryotinia species can grow on almost any moist or decaying herbaceous vegetation. Weeds and plant debris are common sources of gray mold spores, which are produced in enormous numbers and readily spread in air to nearby plants. Gray mold is particularly troublesome under high humidity and moderate temperatures (70\u00b0 to 77\u00b0F), but it is also active over a broader temperature range. Infection by Botrytis and Botryotinia species causes herbaceous plant parts to decay, discolor, and wilt. Affected plants develop spotted flower petals and leaves and infected buds can fail to open. When infected tissues are wet, commonly grayish fungal spores develop on the decaying tissue and give the tissues a fuzzy or woolly appearance. Infected terminals may die back. On roses large, diffuse, target-like lesions can form on green canes. Provide proper cultural care to keep plants vigorous. Use good sanitation practices and modify environmental conditions where feasible. Remove and dispose of old blossoms, declining green plant tissue, plant debris, fallen leaves, and weeds. Avoid wetting foliage, such as by using drip or microsprinkler irrigation. Improve air circulation around plants. For example, adequately space plants, prune canopies to eliminate some branches and foliage, and cut back nearby and overhead vegetation. Where gray mold has been a problem, the fungicides chlorothalonil, thiophanate methyl, or triforine can be applied before disease develops. Fungicides are only preventative and generally are not very effective in landscapes when conditions (e.g., susceptible plant material and wet conditions) favor gray mold development. Many gray mold populations are resistant to certain fungicides.

        "description": "Adelgids (family Adelgidae) are aphidlike insects that suck plant juices from conifers. At least eight species occur in California. Hosts include Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, larch, pine, and spruce. Adelgids commonly occur beneath cottony white or grayish wax they secrete or inside of galled plant tissue. The adelgids themselves are small, dark, soft-bodied, oval insects. The insects can look different depending on the host, and several different-looking stages of the same species can occur together. Balsam woolly adelgid. Adelges piceae has seriously damaged or killed tens of thousands of true fir trees in the eastern United States. Inadvertently introduced from Europe, it more recently has become established in Oregon and northwestern California. This adelgid occurs only on Abies species and does not alternate hosts in the United States. The round, dark purple to black adelgids are 1\u204425 inch long or less. They occur under cottony wax on fir twigs and trunk bark. When infested, shoots become stunted and develop globular galled wood (gouting) around buds and branch nodes. Infested shoots and limbs die back and the firs gradually decline and commonly die. If you find an adelgid-infested dying fir or suspected balsam woolly adelgids, report the location to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. For more information see Balsam Woolly Adelgid from Utah State University. Cooley spruce gall adelgid. Adelges cooleyi feeds on spruce and Douglas-fir and some populations alternate generations between these hosts. Nymphs produce a white, cottony tuft where each individual settles and feeds on cones, needles, and shoots. High populations cause needles to become distorted, spotted, and drop prematurely. Cooley spruce gall adelgid feeding can cause spruce terminals to distort into a gall that eventually encloses a group of the insects. The galls are 1/2 to 3 inches long and light green to purple. About midsummer, the nymphs emerge from galls and molt into winged adults. The empty galls harden, turn brown, and die and may persist for years. Cooley spruce gall adelgid produces galls on spruce only when Douglas-fir is nearby because this alternate host is the source of the adelgid\u2019s gall-forming stage. Galls in California are mostly seen along the North Coast and in mountainous areas where Douglas-fir is common. For more information and an illustration of its host-alternating life cycle, see Cooley Spruce Galls from Colorado State University. Pine bark adelgids. The pine bark adelgid (Pineus strobi), also called the pine bark aphid, and the pine leaf adelgid (Pineus pinifoliae) produce abundant pale wax where they feed on pine bark and twigs. Some populations migrate between pine and spruce. On spruce twigs infested by Pineus species galls form and are typically smaller and less prominent than the galls of Cooley spruce gall adelgid. Adult female Pineus species are dark blue to purplish black, soft-bodied insects that lay yellowish pink eggs in cottony, wax-covered masses. The mobile first instars (crawlers) that emerge resemble tiny pepper grains on the cottony egg masses. Settled nymphs (immatures) are brown, dark blue, or greenish and occur under wax. Adelgids develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Most adelgids have several generations per year and a complex life history that can include several types of adults with differing appearance. Their biology can include generations alternating between two different conifer species. Adelgids suck and feed on conifers and inject saliva that can cause host tissue to distort. Adelges and Pineus species cause white cottony tufts on the bark, branches, cones, needles, or twigs. Heavily infested trees may seem covered with snow. Cone-shaped galls or swollen twigs may develop on infested fir and spruce. High adelgid populations cause foliage yellowing, early drop of needles, and drooping and dieback of terminals. Prolonged high populations can retard plant growth. Vigorous plants tolerate moderate populations and most adelgid species are unlikely to seriously harm trees. Exceptions are balsam woolly adelgid introduced in Northern California and hemlock woolly adelgid in the eastern United States. Be alert for these serious pests and any unusually damaging adelgid problems on hemlock, true fir, or spruce. If suspected balsam woolly adelgids or hemlock woolly adelgids are found where not known to occur report the location the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. Usually no control is needed to protect the health of established trees. An exception is the balsam woolly adelgid. See the balsam woolly adelgid section in Managing Insects and Diseases of Oregon Conifers (PDF) from Oregon State University for strategies to control this pest. Predators of adelgids are especially important in natural forests, where most adelgids are uncommon. Adelgid predators include brown lacewings, green lacewings, the small maggotlike larvae of aphid flies and predaceous midges, and adults and larvae of several species of small lady beetles. Replace some spruce with other species to reduce adelgid populations that alternate hosts. A forceful stream of water directed at the cottony masses on conifers, especially on trunks, dislodges and kills many adelgids. On spruce, to restore the plant\u2019s aesthetic quality and provide some control, break off or clip and dispose of infested foliage when the galls are green and before the insects have emerged. Avoid excess fertilization and quick-release fertilizers, which can promote adelgid abundance. High adelgid populations, especially on young trees, can be controlled by applying horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids), or certain other insecticides in the spring when crawlers are abundant. Be aware that oil spray may remove the desirable bluish color from foliage of certain conifers (e.g., blue spruce), but this does not affect tree health. Avoid residual, broad-spectrum insecticides (e.g., carbaryl and pyrethroids), which can cause an increase in spider mite populations unless a miticide is added. Insecticide sprays are more effective when a wetting agent is added and applications are made with high-pressure equipment so that the spray penetrates the insects\u2019 waxy secretions. Certain systemic insecticides (e.g., imidacloprid) can be effective. Insecticide sprays are not effective in preventing galls unless application is correctly timed based on careful and frequent monitoring. Examine the base of terminal buds on spruce and locate the overwintering females. Inspect females regularly during late winter and spring to determine when they begin to increase greatly in size and start to produce waxy strands; at this time thorough spraying with insecticide can provide control.

        "description": "Larvae of this moth (family Lyonetiidae) are probably the most common species among the many leafminer species that can feed on oaks. First instars (larvae) form circular white cocoons on leaves. The last (third) instar forms an elongate, cigar-shaped cocoon with distinct longitudinal ribs. These pupal (last instar) cocoons can occur on oak bark and leaves and on nearby objects and plants. Larvae are green, olive-green, or yellowish with rows of pale spots. They have distinct segments and a small, pale brown head. The mature larva and its pupal cocoon are about 1/4 inch long. Adults (moths) are mottled brown, tan, and silvery to whitish. They have a wingspan of 1/3 inch. When wings are spread, numerous hairlike setae line the rear margin of wings, especially the hind wings. Oak ribbed casemaker overwinters as a prepupa or pupa in an elongate cocoon. Adults emerge in the spring and after mating females lay eggs on leaves of various oak species. First instars mine inside the leaf. The second and third instars feed externally on the lower leaf surface then pupate. The summer generation adults emerge and mate and the females lay eggs. The hatching larvae feed until they form the overwintering pupae. There are two generations per year. Larval chewing inside oak leaves or on the leaf underside causes damaged foliage to appear brown, translucent, or tan. First instars form pale, narrow, linear mines inside leaves. Late instars chew on and skeletonize the underside of foliage causing circular discolorations. The oak ribbed casemaker in California occurs on at least California black oak, coast live oak, interior live oak, and valley oak. The chewing of its larvae discolors oak foliage. However, even extensive leaf chewing and mining appear not to threaten the survival of otherwise healthy oaks. No control is generally warranted to protect the health of oaks. If leaf mining damage is intolerable, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) can be applied to thoroughly cover the underside of leaves using a high pressure sprayer. Time applications for when the roundish cocoon of first instars appears on foliage. Because Bt is of short persistence and not all larvae are in a susceptible stage at the same time, a second application about 7 to 10 days after the first can be made. Other types of insecticides are not recommended because they may adversely affect the natural enemies that keep many of the numerous oak-feeding insects under good biological control. For effective control on large oaks, a professional applicator must be hired. For tips, consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. For example, tell the company the particular insecticide that you want applied, Bacillus thuringiensis.

        "description": "This phloem-sucking soft scale (Coccidae) is a pest on citrus and hackberry in the Central Valley of California. The tiny crawlers (mobile first-instar nymphs) are yellow with short legs. On leaves, the newly settled first-instar nymphs are flat, translucent, and barely visible with the naked eye. First instars become yellowish and plump by late summer. In the fall, nymphs become mottled brown second instars on leaves or twigs. In late winter (about March), the second instars on twigs enlarge and become mottled gray. Mature females are mottled dark brown to gray, convex, oval shaped, and about 1/4 inch long. Brown soft scale, Coccus hesperidum, resembles citricola scale. The mature brown soft scale is smaller, about 1/6 inch or less, and yellow or dark brown, not gray. Because brown soft scale has several overlapping generations per year, different-sized life stages commonly occur at the same time. Citricola scale has only one generation per year, so most individuals are about the same size, except when the crawlers are emerging from beneath females. Citricola scale occurs on leaves or twigs depending on the life stage and time of year. Females on twigs each lay several eggs per day beneath their body during a 1- to 2-month period in May through July. Eggs hatch after 2 to 3 days, and the mobile crawlers emerge. In northern California, citricola scale crawler density peaks at about 635 degree-days above 52\u00b0F accumulated from March 1. Crawlers settle to feed mostly on the underside of leaves. In severe infestations, crawlers also settle on the upper leaf surface and on twigs. First instars grow slowly during the summer. In the fall, nymphs molt into second instars and migrate to twigs. In late winter, the second instars enlarge and mature into adult females by late April or early May. There are no males. Citricola scales suck phloem juices from leaves and twigs and excrete honeydew on fruit and leaves. Dark sooty mold grows on the honeydew and along with the sticky honeydew can be annoying. High citricola scale populations over several years may kill twigs and reduce tree vigor, flowering, and fruit set. Citricola scale is well controlled by parasites in south coastal California, but not in California\u2019s Central Valley. Conserve natural enemies where they are present. If applying horticultural oil, spray the underside of foliage during about late July through early September, after monitoring indicates that most crawlers have emerged and settled. Alternatively, hackberry can be sprayed with oil after leaves drop during the dormant season. Pest Notes: Scales The Scale Insects of California Part 1: The Soft Scales (PDF)",

        "description": "At least three cochineal scale (Dactylopiidae) species occur in California. These sucking insects feed only on cacti, usually on prickly pear (Nopalea, Opuntia, and Platyopuntia spp.). Scale presence is undesirable on prickly pears planted as drought-tolerant ornamentals and thorny living fences and for their edible fruit and pads. Settled stages of Dactylopius spp. have a bright red body. Adult females are 1/16 to 1/4 inch long. Except for the pinkish crawlers and adult males, cochineal scales are immobile and covered with pale, sticky, wax. Their red color often is not visible unless the body cover is pierced. The delicate adult males have one pair of wings and two long thin tail filaments. California cochineal scale, Dactylopius confusus, females are imbedded in more profuse white wax secretions than the other Dactylopius spp. Once settled and feeding, it generally is not possible to distinguish one individual California cochineal scale from another. Opuntia cochineal scale, D. opuntiae, usually occurs in groups around the bases of prickly pear spines. The white covers secreted by each female are separate. Tomentose cochineal scale, D. tomentosus, produces much less wax than the other California species. Its wax is more transparent and consists of relatively straight filaments. The body of settled tomentose cochineal scales generally is visible through the wax filaments. Similar-looking species include the cactus spine scale, Acanthococcus coccineus, and A. dubius. Both Acanthococcus spp. form white egg sacs on cactus, which resemble the white covers of Dactylopius. The cactus mealybug, Spilococcus mamillariae, also forms white egg sacs on cactus. Its body fluid color is gray rather than bright red. The spinose mealybug, Hypogeococcus spinosus, resembles Dactylopius spp. It has a reddish body, but it is not as bright red. Spinose mealybug is seldom encountered in California outside of plant nurseries. All species of Dactylopius have several generations per year. Female scales develop through three life stages (instars). Males have five instars. Female cochineal scales lay eggs, which hatch into mobile first instars (crawlers), each less than 1/25 inch long. Female crawlers are covered with elongate, stiff bristles that enable the insects to disperse on the wind. Once settled, females feed in the same place for the rest of their life and secrete wax that covers the body. Females molt (shed their skin) twice, and after the second molt are mature and ready to mate. Each mated female can lay hundreds of eggs over a period of several weeks. Male crawlers have fewer and shorter bristles than females, but can be wind dispersed. The immature males spend several days feeding and moving on the plant before secreting a waxy, open-ended, hollow cocoon. Inside the cocoon, the male molts into a stage sometimes called a pupa, although scale insects do not have a true pupal stage. Males then molt into a winged adult, which leaves the cocoon and flies to find a female to mate. Adult males live only a few days and do not feed. Cochineal scales when abundant can stunt the growth of prickly pear and cause chlorosis where they feed in groups. In addition to their fouling of plants with sticky wax and the red staining when their body is squished, prolonged feeding by abundant cochineal scales can cause severe decline and eventually the death of prickly pear. If a plant is heavily colonized by cochineal scales, you can prune off and discard the most\u00ad damaged pads, use a forceful spray of water to wash away scales' waxy covering, and spray insecticidal soap on the exposed scale bodies. Beneficial uses of cochineal scales Cochineal scales have been deliberately introduced in locations around the world. Biological control of weedy cacti. These scales help to biologically control introduced prickly pear. These cacti are undesirable where they displace forage plants needed for livestock and wildlife. At least four Dactylopius spp. were introduced into South Africa (PDF) to control invasive cacti. The opuntia cochineal scale was introduced on Santa Cruz Island, California, to control prickly pear that outcompete native vegetation needed by desirable wildlife. Natural dye. In Mexico and South America, the cochineal insect, Dactylopius coccus, has been cultured for centuries as the source of the bright red carmine dye. The cochineal industry was lucrative for several hundred years and peaked around 1876, when as much as 7 million pounds of cochineal were produced. The development of synthetic (petroleum-derived), aniline dyes caused a dramatic decline in cochineal production. Subsequent concern that synthetic red dyes may pose health human health hazards have renewed interest in cochineal scale production. Cochineal insects are still cultured for their carmine dye in the Canary Islands, Mexico, and Peru.

        "description": "This sucking insect (Monophlebidae, formerly Margarodidae) can occur on many woody species. Its common hosts include citrus, cocculus, nandina, and pittosporum. The female body is orangish brown, and at maturity it is distinguished by its elongated, fluted, white cottony egg sac, up to 1/2 inch long. Eggs are oblong and red. The crawlers (mobile, first-instar nymphs) are red with dark legs and antennae. Once crawlers settle and begin feeding, they excrete a covering of yellowish to white wax. All nymphal instars are reddish shortly after molting, before they produce cottony secretions. First- and second-instar nymphs settle on twigs and leaves, usually along leaf veins. Third instars occur on branches. Mature female scales occur mostly on large branches or the trunk. The loose, white cocoon of immature males and the minute, red, winged adult male are rarely seen. Cottony cushion scales retain legs and can move throughout their life. The scale has two to three generations per year. Cottony cushion scale sucks phloem sap from the leaves, twigs, branches, and trunk. The scale usually occurs at very low densities unless its natural enemies are disrupted, for example, by application of certain insecticides. An exception is on laurel-leaf snailseed, Cocculus laurifolius, which often is highly infested with cottony cushion scale; the scale-eating vedalia lady beetle avoids this plant. When infestations are extremely heavy, feeding by the scales can result in defoliation and dieback of twigs and small branches and severely reduce the yield of citrus trees. Cottony cushion scales excrete honeydew, which causes blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants. A parasitic fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae (Cryptochaetidae), and a lady beetle, the vedalia, Rodolia cardinalis, are the most important natural enemies of cottony cushion scale. Both Cryptochaetum and vedalia are common where the scale occurs in coastal California. Vedalia predominates in inland areas. The red and black adults of vedalia feed voraciously on cottony cushion scales. The young, reddish vedalia larvae feed on scale eggs; more mature larvae feed on all scale stages. The orangish larvae of the parasitic Cryptochaetum feed within the scale; later their dark, oblong pupal cases may be seen there. This fly produces up to eight generations per year. Conserve natural enemies by controlling ants and dust and by avoiding use of broad-spectrum, residual insecticides, which can have a severe adverse effect on vedalia. If scales cannot be tolerated until natural enemies become abundant, apply horticultural oil to deciduous hosts during the dormant season or spray foliage when the tiny, reddish scale crawlers and young nymphs are the predominate stages. See Pest Notes: Cottony Cushion Scale for more information. For photographs of each life stage, consult Stages of the Cottony Cushion Scale (Icerya purchasi) and its Natural Enemy, the Vedalia Beetle (Rodolia cardinalis) (PDF).",

        "description": "More than one dozen species of Neodiprion sawflies (Diprionidae) feed openly on conifer needles. The species are named for a preferred host, most commonly a particular pine species. More than 20 species of Acantholyda sawflies (Pamphiliidae) feed within silk nests on pines and other conifers. These are called webspinning sawflies, or false webworms. Arborvitae, cypress, Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, juniper, larch, and spruce are also hosts of Acantholyda or Neodiprion species or both. Cypress sawfly and other Susana species (Tenthredinidae) feed on arborvitae, cypress, and juniper.",
        "identification": "Sawflies are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the adult female\u2019s sawlike abdominal appendage for laying eggs in plant tissue. Most conifer sawfly adults are 1/3 inch long or less and brownish to black overall. They have two pairs of wings with prominent veins and a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae are commonly brownish, green, or yellowish green overall and resemble caterpillars (larvae of butterflies and moths, Lepidoptera). Larvae commonly have a black or brownish head and increasingly develop contrasting stripes or spots on the body as they mature. Neodiprion larvae, especially when young, will feed several to a needle, often with their heads pointed away from the twig or their bodies wrapped around the needle. Larvae tend to disperse and feed singly as they mature. Larvae of Neodiprion have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two through eight (seven pairs) and their rear end is clasperlike. Five or fewer abdominal segments have pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. It may not be possible to distinguish Neodiprion larvae to species; what appear to be the same species may be a complex of multiple species. Look-alike species can be given varying names, such as that named both balsam fir sawfly and Douglas-fir sawfly. Acantholyda larvae spin nests or silken webs on conifer foliage. They feed inside the silk in groups or singly, varying by the species. Unlike openly feeding sawflies, these webspinning species have no abdominal appendages except for the clasperlike rear end.",
        "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages. They hatch from an egg, grow through several increasingly larger instars, pupate, and emerge as an adult. Adult females lay eggs in niches (notches) in needles. The sawflies overwinter as eggs in plant tissue or as mature larvae (prepupae) or pupae. Neodiprion species pupate inside a thin, papery cocoon in litter or topsoil. Acantholyda species generally pupate in an earthen cell in topsoil. These sawflies require one or more years to complete one generation. Some individuals may remain in the cocoon or soil cell as resting-stage (diapausing) prepupae (mature larvae) or pupae for more than one year; these individuals may be active and feeding on foliage during only one several-week period over a time span of 2 to 3 years.",
        "damage": "Neodiprion larvae chew foliage during either spring to summer, or fall to winter, varying by the species. Young larvae feed in a group on the outer tissue of mostly older needles, leaving the central ribs that later turn yellow brown and may break off. Later instars consume most of the needle. Infested trees have sparse foliage and only shoot terminals may remain green. Acantholyda form and feed within \"nests\" on foliage during late spring and early summer. The nests are composed of cast skins, chewed needles, and frass (excrement) webbed together with silk. Nests often persist after larvae are no longer present. Some species occasionally become very abundant and extensively defoliate hosts, most commonly small trees in forested areas and tree plantations. Otherwise-healthy conifers can be killed by a single complete or extensive defoliation. Widespread outbreaks sporadically occur in forests and can kill numerous trees. In California, sawfly numbers are low during most years and their feeding commonly is innocuous to moderate and not threatening to plant health. Although their defoliation is occasionally very noticeable, sawfly feeding alone rarely kills or seriously harms conifers in landscapes.",
        "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on a small portion of the plant. Species that feed openly are relatively easy to control if sprayed with almost any insecticide applied to achieve good coverage, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars.

        "description": "This exotic thrips (family Thripidae) was discovered in Los Angeles and Orange counties of Southern California in 2015. It was previously introduced into Hawaii and much of the Southern United States. Based on the environments of its occurrence elsewhere, chilli thrips is expected to spread throughout most of California. ",
        "identification": "Plant damage is generally the first indication that this tiny insect is present. The foliage discoloration and distortion caused by its feeding resembles plant damage caused by broadleaf herbicides (e.g., 2,4-D, dicamba), broad-spectrum herbicide (glyphosate), or another herbicide. Feeding damage of chilli thrips also resembles that of broad mite and other Tarsonemidae and aphids when they infest and distort shoot buds and tips. Chilli thrips in the field cannot be identified to species. It resembles several other common thrips including avocado thrips and citrus thrips (both also Scirtothrips species, onion thrips, and western flower thrips. Confidently distinguishing chilli thrips requires expert preparation of specimens and examination of microscopic characters. When the tiny insects themselves are observed, a distinguishing characteristic is that unlike most other thrips they resemble, they do not drop as mature larvae to pupate on the ground. The prepupae and pupae of chilli thrips are generally found on leaves and in the axils of leaves, in curled leaves, or under the calyx (flower sepals or green whorl of leafy material on top of a fruit). Adult chilli thrips have a mostly yellow body with pale brown wings and bands on top of the abdomen. They are about 1/20 inch long, about one-half the size of adults of the other thrips named above. Larvae are pale yellow to whitish, as are the immatures of many other thrips species. Distinguishing characteristics of adult chilli thrips include antennae that are eight-segmented with segments I\u2013II pale and III\u2013VIII dark. The head is pale with three pairs of setae (tiny hairs) near the three, red eyespots (ocelli); one pair of which occur between the hind pair of ocelli. On top of the abdomen are three setae near the outer margin of each segment.",
        "life_cycle": "The life stages of thrips are egg, first and second instars (larvae or nymphs), prepupa (or propupa), pupa, and adult. Adult females insert their eggs inside plant tissue, commonly in buds and the underside of leaves. Each female lays about 60 to 200 eggs during her lifetime. The eggs hatch in 6 to 8 days. The 2 larval stages last about 6 to 10 days, during which they actively feed on hosts as do the adults. Mature larvae develop into prepupae for about 1 day then pupae for 2 to 3 days during which they do not feed. Chilli thrips can complete 1 generation from egg to adult in 2 to 3 weeks when temperatures are warm. There are multiple generations per year.",
        "damage": "Chilli thrips mainly feeds on buds and young leaves. However, all above ground parts of its host plants may be discolored or distorted by its feeding. Injured buds, fruits, and tender leaves commonly turn blackish to bronze in color. Damaged leaves curl and distort. Infested leaves and heavily infested plants can be atypically undersized. Feeding on buds may cause them to become brittle and drop. Some hosts, when heavily infested, prematurely drop many or all of their leaves. Chilli thrips is principally a garden and landscape pest. It can infest more than 200 plant species in 70 plant families, most of them ornamentals. Hosts include aucuba, begonia, camellia, chrysanthemum, coleus, crape myrtle, English ivy, euonymus, geranium, Indian hawthorn, marigold, petunia, pittosporum, podocarpus, poinsettia, privet, pyracantha, rhododendron, rose, schefflera, star jasmine, viburnum, and zinnia. Chilli thrips can also attack certain food plants including blueberry, chili, eggplant, grape, pepper, strawberry, and tomato. But elsewhere in the United States it generally has not been a serious crop pest. There is more than one strain of chilli thrips and the hosts can differ depending on the strain.",
        "solutions": "If you suspect that you have chilli thrips on your plants, it can be helpful to collect samples for expert identification. Seal infested plant parts in a zip-lock bag and take them for identification and advice to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner or University of California Cooperative Extension. Do not move suspected chilli thrips across county borders unless they are dead. If moving them across borders is needed to obtain an identification, to kill the thrips place the container with the them in a freezer overnight. Chilli thrips are not easily controlled. Where they occur, use good sanitation to reduce thrips habitat. Remove weeds, plant debris, and old flowers and seal them in plastic bags for disposal. Do not compost debris from plants infested with chilli thrips as the insects can survive and move to infest hosts. Obtain new plants from a quality, commercial supplier to reduce the likelihood of introducing thrips or other pests. If plants are grown in a greenhouse, screen openings with screen size of less than 1/32 inch (0.8 mm) to reduce thrips movement into the greenhouse. Because airflow is obstructed by screens of small pore sizes, the screened surface area must be increased to compensate. Biological control agents available for purchase and application to manage thrips include entomopathogenic fungi (e.g., Beauveria bassiana), predaceous mites (e.g., Amblyseius and Neoseiulus species), and minute pirate bugs (Orius species). These natural enemies must be released early before thrips are abundant or their damage has occurred. Natural enemies will not control an existing high population of thrips. To allow natural enemies to potentially be effective Avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides for all pests. Control ants because they attack natural enemies. Minimize dust that interferes with the activities of parasitoids and predators (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs). Plant flowering species (insectary plants) to provide nectar and pollen to feed adult natural enemies. See Natural Enemy Releases for Biological Control of Crop Pests and Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. No insecticides provide complete control of chilli thrips. Potentially effective insecticides include those with systemic or translaminar (entering the plant through the leaf surface) movement including acephate, imidacloprid, and spinosad. However insecticide resistance is common in chilli thrips. Chilli thrips are generally resistant to pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, permethrin, and other \"-thrin\" insecticides); pyrethroids are not recommended for control. When damage is noticed the thrips may no longer be present, because damage from thrips feeding does not become apparent until later when plant tissue has expanded and grown. It may be best to delay any insecticide application until the following growing season and then make the application when new growth appears on hosts that were damaged by thrips the previous growing season.

        "description": "These insects (family Cicadidae) are known for the loud, shrill buzz or click sounds males of many species make to attract females. At least 65 species in 8 genera occur in California, including at least 36 Okanagana species and 18 Platypedia species. Unlike in the eastern United States, aside from their sporadic noise making cicadas are generally not pests in California landscapes.",
        "identification": "Adult cicadas are robust insects up to 1-1/2 inches long with mostly clear wings. They are commonly blackish or dark brown, although some species have green, orange, or red markings. To help discriminate between types (families) of insects with similar-looking adults see Distinguishing Among Sucking Insects That Resemble Each Other. See CalPhotos for more pictures of more cicada adults and nymphs. Eggs are narrow, whitish, and several times longer than they are wide. Eggs occur in groups hidden in twig bark. Where oviposition occurred bark can appear punctured or repeatedly cut into with a blade. Nymphs occur hidden in soil where they feed on roots. They are pale and stout and appear hunchbacked.",
        "life_cycle": "Cicadas develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Adult females lay eggs in tender bark of twigs, commonly twigs about the diameter of a pencil. The hatching nymphs drop to the ground and use their enlarged clawlike forelegs to burrow into soil. Each nymph sucks and feeds on the xylem fluid of roots for several years as it develops through about five increasingly larger instars. The mature last instar then emerges from underground, climbs an object, sheds its skin, and becomes an adult. Adults seek mates and the mated females lay their eggs. One generation commonly requires several years with almost the entire life span spent as nymphs feeding underground.",
        "damage": "The loud, shrill buzz and click of male cicadas can be annoying. But each male lives only a few weeks and those of a species commonly all emerge and die during roughly the same time. Females can cause terminal dieback where their insertion of eggs into woody shoots girdles the stem, killing twigs and small branches. However, reports of cicada damage are uncommon in California. ",
        "solutions": "Predators of cicadas include birds, moles, other vertebrates, predaceous wasps (e.g., family Sphecidae), and spiders. However, it's believed that natural enemies generally have little effect on cicada populations in part because most of their life cycle is spent in soil where nymphs can occur on roots as deeply as two feet below the surface. Except for preventatively netting young woody plants to exclude insects, cicada control efforts generally are not effective. Within a few weeks after they emerge, the relatively short-lived adults will die. In California, these noisy insects generally are not pests and do not warrant control efforts.

Spot treat where aphids are most abundant to preserve natural enemies elsewhere. Repeated soap sprays may wash away stickiness and exposed cast skins.

        "description": "At least four species of wax scales (Coccidae) occur in California. Irregular wax scale, Ceroplastes irregularis, and tortoise wax scale, C. cistudiformis, generally are not pests. Barnacle scale, C. cirripediformis, is a pest primarily in southern California on gardenia. It also feeds on citrus and many other hosts. Chinese wax scale, C. sinensis, along the South Coast and in the San Francisco Bay Area is sometimes a pest on Australian willow, Escallonia, and mayten. Occasionally it is abundant on other hosts, including California bay, coyote brush, holly, Mahonia, and pepper tree. Wax scale females are hemispherical and covered with thick, oily wax. Their predominant color is pale gray. Mature females range in size from 1/12 to 1/3 inch long. Their bodies have waxy ridges and white or dark-colored indentations or speckles. Nymphs are reddish, but their body is partially to almost completely covered with conical, stellate (star-shaped), or rosette-shaped, wax plates. Barnacle scale adults are present from late July through winter. Early instar nymphs usually occur on the upper side of leaves. Third instar nymphs move to twigs where they mature into females and lay eggs beneath their body. Chinese wax scale adult females are present from May through September. Egg hatch is most abundant in autumn. Males occur but are rare. Wax scales apparently have one generation per year. Crawlers are most abundant during fall but may be present anytime from summer through winter. Wax scales are occasional pests of various ornamentals. These Ceroplastes spp. can create a gooey mess on many different hosts by excreting copious honeydew. These infestations rarely, if ever, threaten plant health. Female scales commonly are killed by parasites, as evidenced by the round emergence holes in their body. Control ants, which attack the natural enemies of scale insects. Conserving natural enemies and applying horticultural oil or certain other insecticides are primary tactics for managing scales. If applying oil, thoroughly spray infested plant parts when crawlers and early-instar nymphs are the predominant stages.

        "description": "Larvae (caterpillars) of various moth species are called webworms because of the profuse silk they form on foliage where they feed.",
        "identification": "Webworms typically feed on silk-covered leaves near the terminals (tips) of branches. This helps to distinguish them from tent caterpillars, which usually web inner foliage around the juncture (crotch) of branches. Cotoneaster webworm. Athrips rancidella (Gelechiidae) larvae feed during spring and summer, mostly on cotoneaster foliage in at least the San Francisco Bay Area. Larvae are dark brown and grow up to 1/2 inch long. They web together groups of leaves and skeletonize their underside while feeding within silken tubes on branches and foliage. Larvae overwinter within silk on plants and in the spring pupate and emerge as adults. The adult is a brown to dark-gray, night-active moth with a wingspan of less than 1/2 inch. Cypress leaftier. Epinotia subviridis (Tortricidae) is a significant pest of ornamental arborvitae and cypress; it also feeds on junipers and often occurs with the cypress tipminer. The cypress webber on arborvitae, cedar, and cypress and the juniper webworm on junipers cause similar damage. Cypress leaftier larvae are blackish pink and grow up to 1/2 inch long. They feed singly on foliage inside a cocoonlike shelter that includes gnawed leaves and twigs. Adults are mostly brown to gray moths with black and orangish markings. Cypress webber. Hypsopygia (=Herculia) phoezalis (Pyralidae) feeds on various broadleaved shrubs and trees. It is a pest mostly on ornamental arborvitae, cedar, and cypress in southern California. The larvae are blackish, grow up to 3/4 inch long, and feed in a group in loosely webbed, silk tunnels. The adult is a mostly dark brown moth with a wingspan of about 1 inch. Fall webworm. Hyphantria cunea feeds on more than 100 deciduous species of broadleaf ornamentals and fruit and nut trees. The hairy larvae in California populations are commonly gray, orangish, or yellowish brown and feed in a group on shoot terminals. They form increasingly larger, silken tents that become apparent relatively late in the growing season. Juniper webworm. Dichomeris marginella (Gelechiidae) feeds on junipers. Larvae are mostly yellowish brown with a black head, prothoracic shield, and legs. Older instars have three, dark brown, lengthwise stripes. Young larvae tunnel inside needles and older instars web and chew externally on foliage and grow up to 3/5 inch long. Adults are 1/4 inch long with a wingspan of 2/3 inch. They are coppery-brown moths with a white, longitudinal band on the inner and outer margin of each forewing. Mimosa webworm. Homadaula anisocentra (Galacticidae) is an occasional or sporadic pest in the Sacramento Valley. It feeds on mimosa (Albizia spp.), and less-often on honeylocust (Gleditsia triacanthos). Young larvae feed in groups covered with silk, causing foliage to turn brown and die. Larvae vary from blackish brown to gray to olive-green and have five, longitudinal, white stripes on the body. Larvae grow up to 2/5 inch long, feed singly, and pupate on hosts in a silken cocoon. The adults are gray to whitish moths with numerous black spots on the forewings and a wingspan of 1/2 inch. Palo Verde webworm. Faculta inaequalis (Gelechiidae) occurs in Southern California and the Southwestern United States. It feeds on Parkinsonia spp., most commonly on foothills Palo Verde, P. microphylla. Larvae grow up to 1/2 inch long and feed in a group in or on silk tubes or rolled webbing. Adults are about 1/4 inch long and brown to gray moths with markings of black, orange, or both.",
        "life_cycle": "Webworms develop through four stages - egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult (moth). The time of year each life stage is present and the number of generations can vary by the location and species of host plant. Cypress leaftier. Female moths lay pale, disklike eggs singly on the scalelike leaves of hosts. The emerging larvae feed singly in a cocoonlike nest and can be present most any time of the year. Larvae may periodically abandon their feeding nest and form a new nest on undamaged shoot tips. Most of the larval feeding and foliage browning occur during spring and early summer as larvae mature. Overwintering is as larvae, which pupate during late winter to spring. Adult females can be present and laying eggs anytime from March through September, mostly during April through June. There appears to be two, overlapping generations per year. Cypress webber. Overwintering is as larvae, which pupate in the spring. By late spring, the adults emerge and mate and females lay eggs in a group on the terminal leaves of hosts. There is one generation per year. Juniper webworm. Early instars tunnel and feed inside foliage. Older instars feed externally and overwinter in webbing on foliage. Larvae resume feeding in late winter and pupate by late spring. There is one generation per year. Mimosa webworm. Larvae overwinter and pupate in a whitish cocoon on bark or in litter beneath trees. The adults emerge and mate and females lay eggs in spring. The mimosa webworm usually has two generations per year in California.",
        "damage": "The caterpillars chew leaves and form silken tents or webbing on host trees. Their feeding causes foliage to turn brown, die, and drop prematurely. When abundant, larvae can consume all the leaves on a tree. Vigorous and otherwise-healthy plants generally tolerate extensive leaf chewing and moderate defoliation. Most webworm species are not abundant during most years and commonly their presence is innocuous. Mature larvae of mimosa webworm drop from trees on a silk strand before pupating, When abundant, the strands annoy people and foul surfaces and vehicles under infested trees. Larvae move after dropping from hosts and pupate in white cocoons on buildings or other structures. Sometimes larvae enter homes to pupate.",
        "solutions": "Webworm abundance is sporadic in part because they are fed on by many parasites and predators. To preserve the effectiveness of these natural enemies, rely on pruning and selective insecticides if feasible when control action is warranted. Regularly inspect host plants for silken webbing; prune out caterpillar-infested foliage if limited to small portions of the plant. If webbing containing live caterpillars is abundant and cannot be pruned off or tolerated, apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad with a high-pressure sprayer to penetrate webbed foliage. The addition of a wetting agent to increase penetration of the silk by the insecticide enhances control. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. The somewhat-selective spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply it to plants that are flowering. If caterpillar-infested trees are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. Request they apply caterpillar-selective Bt, or spinosad if the plants to be sprayed are not blossoming. High populations of the cypress leaftier and juniper webworm may not be well-controlled by Bt or spinosad; these insecticides are not persistent and the webworms emerge and feed over an extended period. A broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticide such as carbaryl can be applied in the spring when larvae and the egg-laying adults are present. Do not apply carbaryl if bees are present; carbaryl is very toxic to bees and most natural enemies. Because it poisons parasites and predators, applying carbaryl may increase the frequency or likelihood of webworms becoming abundant again later or cause a secondary outbreak of spider mites.

        "description": "Agave weevil, Scyphophorus acupunctatus, and yucca weevil, S. yuccae, can occur throughout California where host plants grow. These weevils are pests primarily in southern California. They resemble each other, and except for differing hosts have much the same biology and management. Adults are most commonly observed on hosts from late winter through summer. They are up to 3/4 inch long and have long, narrow, snoutlike mouthparts and a small, elongated head. Adults are black with a smooth, finely punctured thorax and lengthwise grooves on the wing covers. Mature larvae are up to 1 inch long. They are cylindrical, legless, and white or yellowish with a brown head. Larvae feed hidden in the apical meristem (central growing point) of hosts, the base of green flower stalks, and in roots. Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After mating, adult females chew an egg-laying tunnel in the base of hosts. After hatching from an egg, larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars as they feed and tunnel in plants. Mature larvae generally exit hosts to pupate in topsoil; pupae can also occur in the base of plants. One generation egg to adult can be completed in less than 2 months when temperatures are warm. There can be 4 or 5 generations per year. Adults feed on host sap and this does not threaten plant health. Adult feeding causes discolored, punctured spots or small holes in the foliage. Larvae bore in the base of hosts, causing plants to decline and facilitating entry of plant pathogens. Larval feeding in combination with decay microorganisms that colonize wounded tissue commonly cause infested plants to collapse and die. Agave weevil larvae infest various Agave spp. They bore in the plant base and upper roots of large species of agave that have wide leaf blades and bluish or gray leaf coloring, such as century plant (A. americana). The more narrow-leaved, smaller agaves are less commonly infested. Yucca weevil larvae infest chaparral yucca, or Our Lord\u2019s candle, Hesperoyucca (=Yucca) whipplei. Direct control of agave and yucca weevils is difficult; even with regular inspection of hosts, the insects are often not observed until the plant starts to collapse. Preventive measures are the only effective controls. Provide plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care. Agave and yucca require well drained soils, full sun, and little or no irrigation after they become established. Plant on a mound or raised bed to improve soil drainage. Where feasible, before planting amend soil with sand or other porous materials to improve drainage. Minimize irrigation of established hosts. After any irrigation, allow topsoil to dry between watering events. To help protect nearby hosts, remove dying hosts and the immediately adjacent soil where larvae may be pupating. Promptly dispose of infested material in ways that prevent weevils from emerging or escaping. Where agave weevil has been a problem, consider planting the smaller, narrower-leaved agave species. If applied BEFORE plants become infested, certain systemic insecticides (e.g., imidacloprid) may provide control.

Insect parasitic wasps, or parasitoids, are smaller than their host and develop inside the host's body. The immature stage of the parasite feeds on the host and it kills only one host during its development. The parasitic wasp, Trissolcus basalis, has been imported from Europe and released in several locations throughout the state. The most common parasitic flies are in the family Tachinidae. Adult tachinids often resemble houseflies, and their larvae are maggots that feed inside the host they parasitize. ",

        "description": "This soft scale (family Coccidae) can occur on many deciduous trees, usually on well-shaded plant parts. Liquidambar is the preferred host in California. Occasional hosts include apricot, box elder, maple, plum, and walnut. The mature female is globular and about 1/4 inch in diameter. Living adult females have mottled (calico) coloration; they are black or dark brown with four rows of white or yellow blotches. Small patches of woolly wax can occur on the pale spots. The nymphs are dark brown, flattened, and covered with thick, elevated, plates of pale wax. Calico scale develops through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Overwintering is as second instars, which in late winter mature into adult females that lay eggs beneath their body. During spring the eggs hatch into crawlers (mobile first instars), which move to settle and feed on leaves. Nymphs molt to the second instar during summer. In the fall, the second instars move to overwinter on twigs. There is one generation per year. Scale nymphs and adult females suck phloem sap from twigs. While feeding they excrete sticky honeydew on which grows blackish sooty mold. Low populations are not damaging to plants, but liquidambar (the host preferred in California) may decline if the scale is abundant during several consecutive years. Calico scale is rarely abundant enough to warrant control, except on liquidambar. If this soft scale is damaging hosts or its honeydew is not tolerable, infested branches and shoots can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil during the dormant season, except not on plum and walnut which may be damaged by dormant-season oil. Oil is also effective if sprayed when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time oil application.

        "description": "This introduced (exotic) sucking insect (Coccidae) is a serious pest in the San Francisco Bay Area on tulip tree, Liriodendron tulipifera, and on deciduous magnolias. Its other hosts include gardenia and linden. Mature females are up to 1/3 inch long, irregularly hemispherical, and variably colored, usually brown or gray with irregular black blotches and markings of green, orange, pink, red, or yellow. Older females are more uniformly brown and resemble certain lecanium scales, Parthenolecanium spp. However, the lecanium females mature earlier and by late June are dead and dried out; female tuliptree scales are alive through the fall. Male tuliptree scale nymphs mature into adults within gray to white, puparia (hardened skins of the older nymphs). Puparia are about 1/10 inch long, flat, and broadly oval. The delicate adult male has a red body and one pair of wings. Crawlers (mobile first instars) are reddish. Settled first instars and early-second instars are about 1/24 inch long, oval, chocolate brown, and very difficult to see. Large colonies of tuliptree scale commonly have a distinctive, strong, musky odor. Females mature in late spring and are alive throughout the summer and fall (they exude liquid when their body is squashed). Males develop into adults in spring, mate, live only a brief time as adults, and do not feed. Adult females produce crawlers from August through November and give life birth to nymphs. First instars settle to feed on leaves and young twigs. Overwintering is as dark, second-instar nymphs on twigs. There is one generation per year. The scales suck phloem sap and excrete copious, sticky honeydew, which results in blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants. Heavy infestations weaken or kill young trees. Feeding on terminals can cause shoot dieback, leading to bushy regrowth. On older trees, feeding by prolonged high populations causes limb dieback and the decline and sometimes death of tulip trees. Control ants, which attack scale parasites and predators, interfering with biological pest control. If applying horticultural oil, spray overwintering nymphs during late winter (delayed-dormant season, as buds begin to swell) or spray foliage and shoot terminals during September or October, after most crawlers have emerged. Applying a systemic insecticide is the most practical method for managing this difficult-to-control pest on large trees. Because systemic insecticides can move into nectar and pollen, to minimize toxicity to pollinators and natural enemies that visit flowers, make the application after plants have completed their seasonal flowering.

        "identification": "Each cynipid wasp larva during the second generation feeds inside a brown, oblong swelling that is 1/10 inch long.

Affected flower parts turn into small reddish or brown galls, that when cut reveal pale larvae feeding inside. Second-generation larvae form galls after hatching from eggs laid in the veins of leaves. The wasps overwinter as pupae in galls, which often drop from the leaf. Gall wasp abundance varies naturally from year to year, although these population fluctuations may not be obvious because live oaks can retain galled and scorched foliage for several years.",
        "damage": "Twohorned oak gall wasps kill only portions of each leaf; leaf margins beyond each gall often discolor and die. Each leaf with galls remains partly green, and discolored leaves will be on the same twig as unaffected leaves.",

        "description": "These insects (family Membracidae) suck and feed on various hosts. At least 40 treehopper species occur in California.",
        "identification": "Treehopper adults are commonly brown to greenish but some species have colorful markings. Adults are 1/2 inch long or shorter. They have an expanded first segment behind the head (pronotum) that forms a hoodlike covering over the front, top one-half of their body and may include a thornlike projection. This enlarged prothorax distinguishes treehoppers from most other true bugs (Heteroptera) they resemble. To help you discriminate between types (families) of insects with similar-looking adults see Distinguishing Among Sucking Insects That Resemble Each Other. Treehopper adults and nymphs also have rows of spines along the length of the hind tibia (longest leg segment), as do also cicadas and leafhoppers. Nymphs have numerous spines on the back of the abdomen. Both immatures and adults readily jump when disturbed, such as when they observe movement nearby. Buffalo treehopper. Stictocephala bisonia adults and nymphs are brown or green with a yellowish underside. Adults and last instars are about 2/5 inch long. Nymphs have prominent spines on the back, which is characteristic of treehopper nymphs. Host plants include ash, elm, fruit trees, hawthorn, locust, poplar, and many herbaceous plants (e.g., tomatoes and peppers). Oak treehopper. Platycotis vittata is common in the spring on the lower branches of deciduous and live oaks and occasionally on birch, chestnut, and certain other broadleaf trees. Individuals commonly aggregate in rows on twigs. Adults are bronze to olive-green with reddish bands. The surface of their pronotum is covered with tiny pits. The nymphs are black with red and yellow markings and have two soft, black spines on the back. The spring generation of nymphs is especially colorful. Threecornered alfalfa hopper. Spissistilus festinus adults are about 1/5 inch long and green without distinct spines on the back. Nymphs are greenish with 12 pairs of hairy spines on the back and a protruding tail-like process at the rear of the abdomen. Hosts of adults and nymphs include various legumes, herbaceous weeds, and certain low-growing plants grown as cover crops. Threecornered alfalfa hopper feeding in grapes vectors Grapevine red blotch associated virus.",
        "life_cycle": "Treehoppers develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. After hatching from an egg, nymphs develop through several (commonly five) increasing larger instars. Late instars develop wing pads and the last instar sheds its skin to emerge as an adult. Treehoppers have one to several generations per year, varying by location and species.",
        "damage": "Treehopper feeding damage in landscapes is generally slight and not threatening to plant health. They excrete sticky honeydew on which blackish sooty mold grows. This fouls leaves and twigs and surfaces underneath infested plants. Most treehoppers injure plants primarily by making numerous, small slits or punctures in bark where females lay eggs. Egg punctures cause bark to appear roughened and oviposition-injured twigs may die back. Where terminal dieback occurs regrowth can be crooked or distorted. On herbaceous hosts, treehopper feeding and egg laying sometimes girdles and kills green stems. Mature woody plants tolerate extensive egg laying damage, but the growth of heavily infested younger plants may be slowed.",
        "solutions": "For species known to feed on many different plants (e.g., buffalo treehopper and threecornered alfalfa hopper), removing some of the alternate hosts (e.g., herbaceous weeds) may reduce treehopper feeding on more-valued plants. A forceful stream of water can provide some control on small plants. If treehoppers were abundant on deciduous trees, shrubs, or vines the previous season and damage cannot be tolerated, horticultural (narrow-range) oil can be applied to thoroughly cover terminals during the dormant season to kill overwintering eggs. During the growing season, high populations of nymphs and adults may be reduced by spraying exposed insects with horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids), or another insecticide.

        "description": "Sycamore scale (Steingeliidae) feeds only on Platanus spp., such as London plane and the native California sycamore, P. racemosa. Sucking feeding by the scale causes numerous, small, yellow spots on leaves. Infested leaves can become distorted, discolored, and may drop prematurely. Anthracnose and powdery mildew fungi also commonly cause discoloring and premature drop of sycamore leaves. Distinguish sycamore scale by the tiny, discolored leaf spots it causes and by the scales' cottony wax, especially on bark. The insects themselves are brown or yellow and less than 1/12 inch long. Except for the crawler stage, sycamore scale does not resemble most other scales. Adults resemble immature (wingless) thrips. The nymphs and resting-stage preadults, called cysts, are elliptical and resemble insect eggs or tiny footballs. During certain stages, nymphs produce whitish wax and resemble whitefly pupae. Male cocoons, mature females, and egg masses can also be covered with cottony white tufts. Sycamore scales can occur on foliage from leaf flush through fall and on tender bark anytime of year. They overwinter on and beneath bark, where eggs hatch during late winter. The crawlers (mobile first instars) move from bark to feed on leaves. Some scales develop on bark or move between leaves and bark during summer. Sycamore scale causes small, yellow spots on leaves. Infested leaves can become distorted and stunted and may turn brown and die or drop prematurely. Prolonged high populations of the scale can stunt tree growth and cause dieback of twigs and small branches. On young trees, infestations can cause abnormal bark roughening and sloughing off of bark. Provide appropriate growing conditions and cultural care and protect trees from injuries. Healthy trees are better able to tolerate pest damage, such as premature leaf drop. Lady beetles that feed on sycamore scale include the twicestabbed lady beetle and Exochomus quadripustulatus, which is black with four orange to yellow blotches. Foliar sprays are not recommended because trees are often large and it is difficult to thoroughly wet the underside of leaves where scales feed. If scales were abundant the previous season and damage cannot be tolerated, apply narrow-range oil or another insecticide during bud break.

The spruce spider mite, O. ununguis, can occur on virtually any conifer, including arborvitae, Chamaecyparis, coast redwood, Douglas-fir, fir, giant sequoia, juniper, spruce, and occasionally pine. These tiny mites have an oval, unsegmented body. Depending in part on the host plant and mite species, these mites can be brown, green, or pink. The spruce spider mite produces webbing, especially around the base of needles; neither O. subnudus nor O. milleri produces obvious webbing.",
        "life_cycle": "Spider mites and the predatory mites (Phytoseiidae) that prey on them develop through five life stages. Eggs hatch, producing six-legged larvae. The two nymphal stages and adults have eight legs. Spider mite populations are relatively low on conifers during the winter. Oligonychus subnudus is most abundant in the spring. Oligonychus milleri can be abundant anytime from spring through fall. Spruce spider mite is usually most abundant in the spring and fall, and populations stop reproducing under prolonged high temperatures.",
        "damage": "Feeding by Oligonychus spp. mites causes conifer foliage to become bleached or discolored bronze, reddish, or yellow. Mite damage is usually not as serious as it looks. Most plants tolerate extensive leaf bleaching and stippling without being seriously harmed.",
        "solutions": "The most important management actions are to conserve natural enemies of mites and provide trees with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation to keep plants healthy. Drought-stressed plants experience more mite outbreaks and are less able to tolerate pest feeding. Regularly sprinkling foliage and washing plants during hot weather helps control some mites, in part by removing dust and improving the environment for predaceous mites. High-levels of nitrogen in foliage can favor outbreaks of some mites by increasing their reproduction. Do not apply nitrogen unless fertilization is truly necessary. Avoid applying high rates of nitrogen and use less-soluble forms, such as urea and most organic fertilizers. Natural enemies, especially predaceous mites, frequently control plant-feeding mites. Avoid using broad-spectrum, residual pesticides (e.g., carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) for mites or other pests. Even though their labels may say they control mites, these pesticides kill mite predators. Also, they can induce physiological changes in mites or host plants and, especially during hot weather, sometimes cause dramatic outbreaks of mites. If spraying is warranted, use selective miticides (also called acaricides) or horticultural oil. Be aware that applying horticultural (narrow-range) oil can remove the desirable bluish cast on foliage of certain spruces; this does not damage tree health. Feeding on young foliage may not produce obvious damage until months later, when foliage matures. Therefore, the effectiveness of any current treatment (e.g., thoroughly covering foliage with narrow-range, horticultural oil) may not become apparent until the following season. See Pest Notes: Spider Mites and Mites Associated with Pine Foliage in California for more information.",

        "description": " Obscure mealybug Pseudococcus affinis Identification tip: Obscure mealybug adults are light gray to white, covered with a powdery wax, and have distinct filaments around the body. They occur on many hosts. Longtailed mealybug Pseudococcus longispinus Identification tip: The longtailed mealybug is commonly a pest only on nursery stock and indoor ornamentals. It is distinguished by its two tail filaments, which are longer than its body. Citrus mealybug Planococcus citri Identification tip: Citrus mealybug is a pest of citrus and some indoor ornamentals. It has short, waxy filaments of equal length all around its margin; a dark stripe may be visible down its back. Cypressbark mealybug Ehrhornia cupressi Identification tip: The cypress bark mealybug occurs beneath bark plates on cedar, cypress, and juniper in Pacific Coast states. Nymphs and adults are round, bright red or orangish, and are surrounded by a ring of white wax. Ground mealybugs Rhizoecusspp. Identification tip:Ground mealybugs commonly live in the soil and feed on the roots of many different plants. They may be covered with white wax and their short antennae and legs may be visible, but they do not have obvious filaments along their sides and tail. Gill mealybugs Ferrisia gilli Identification tip: Gill's mealybug causes problems on pistachios, almonds, grapes, stone fruits, and many deciduous ornamentals. They have pink bodies and are covered in white wax. They are also sometimes covered in crystalline filaments, giving the appearance of having long glassy rods. Pink hibiscus mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus\nIdentification tip: The pink hibiscus mealybug is a major problem of many plant species, including citrus, grapes, fig, mulberry, hibiscus, coral tree, and orchid tree. Adults are small, pink, and covered with a waxy secretion. They have very short waxy filaments, often covered by the white mealy wax. Golden mealybug, Nipaecoccus aurilanatus\nIdentification tip: Golden mealybugs infest pine and other araucarias. They have dark purple bodies with a yellow stripe on their upper surface. Coconut mealybug, Nipaecoccus nipae\nIdentification tip: Coconut mealybugs infest palms, avocado, and some flower species. Adult females are oval with yellowish orange bodies and yellow wax. Pyramid-shaped wax tufts surround the body. Comstock mealybug, Pseudococcus comstocki\nIdentification tip: The Comstock mealybug primarily occurs on lemons in the San Joaquin Valley and has a thicker wax cover than the citrus mealybug. In addition, it has two spines at the posterior end, about one-quarter the length of the body. Vine mealybug, Planococcus ficus\nIdentification tip: Vine mealybugs are small (adult females are about 1/8 inch in length), soft, oval, flat, distinctly segmented, and covered with a white, mealy wax that extends into spines (filaments along the body margin and the posterior end). The vine mealybug has a pinkish body that is visible through the powdery wax. Grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus\nIdentification tip: The grape mealybug and the obscure mealybug closely resemble each other. One method of distinguishing them in the field is to poke a female with a sharp point (without puncturing the body) to elicit the release of a defensive excretion. If the color of the fluid excreted is reddish orange, then it is most likely grape mealybug. Solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis\nIdentification tip: The solenopsis mealybug has a wide host range, feeding on various broadleaf species such as tomatoes, eggplant, melons, and potatoes. Adult females have oval bodies covered with a waxy covering with dark bare areas on the thorax and abdomen. ",

        "identification": "The elongate larvae chew circular mines in foliage. Larvae are 1/5 inch or less in length and distinctly wider immediately behind the head. When larvae are present in foliage, they can be observed by examining infested leaves such that foliage is backlit. Adults (moths) are about 1/5 inch long and silvery and tan with black, brown, red, white, or combinations of these. At least nine species of Coptodisca occur in California and are distinguished by their host plants. Photos of the adults and maps of where they have been found are presented by the Moth Photographer's Group of Mississippi State University: Current shield bearer (C. ribesella) feeds in wax current (Ribes cereum). Madrone shield bearer (C. arbutiella) mines the foliage of madrone, manzanita, and strawberry tree. Mountain mahogany leafminer (C. cercocarpella) feeds in Cercocarpus ledifolius. Oak shield bearer (C. quercicolella) infests Quercus species. Poplar shield bearer is an undescribed species that lacks a Latin name. Powell shield bearer (C. powellella) infests coast live oak. Resplendent shield bearer (C. splendoriferella) feeds in various woody plants in the Rosaceae family such as apple and cherry. Walnut shield bearer (C. juglandiella) mines walnut foliage. Willow shield bearer (C. saliciella) infests Salix species. The poplar (cottonwood) shield bearer (Coptodisca sp.) can be abundant on Fremont cottonwood and other Populus species. See Unnamed and Little-Known Insects Attacking Cottonwood in Southern California for more information on this pest.",
        "life_cycle": "Overwintering is as mature larvae (prepupae) or pupae inside of mined tissue that the mature larvae cut from host plants. Adults emerge in spring, mate, and females lay eggs into leaf tissue. After hatching, the larva chews a circular- to oval-shaped leaf mine bordered by the larger veins. Each larva consumes most of the leaf tissue in a spot about 1/5 inch in diameter or less, leaving only the thin, translucent upper and lower leaf epidermis. The mature larva then cuts the remaining epidermis layers within which it fed. It ties the edges of the circular pieces together with silk to form a case (the \"shield\"). The larva drops on a silken thread and carries away its cut portion of the mine and pupates inside the case in bark crevices or litter on the ground. Varying by species, shield bearers have one to several generations per year. For example, the madrone shield bearer has one generation per year. The cottonwood or poplar shield bearer apparently has up to three generations per year. ",
        "damage": "Shield bearer larvae chew and feed in a circular manner within foliage. While feeding, they cause mined foliage to become translucent. At maturity, each larva cuts away the epidermal layers between which it fed, leaving a circular hole in leaves up to 1/5 inch in diameter. There can be up to several dozen holes in a leaf and sometimes most of the leaves on a tree or shrub are affected. However, even high populations of shield bearers appear not to threaten the survival of otherwise healthy plants.",
        "solutions": "Plants tolerate even abundant leafminers and no control is necessary to protect plant survival. If it does not entail removing too much of a plant's foliage, pick and dispose of infested leaves on small plants where damage cannot be tolerated. No other control is known or recommended.

Sawflies vary greatly in feeding habits. Willow gall sawflies feed inside tissues and cause the host to develop colorful swellings. Raspberry horntail bores in stems of caneberries, roses, salmonberry, and thimbleberry, causing shoot dieback. Species with larvae that chew openly on foliage include California pear sawfly, certain conifer sawflies, cypress and juniper sawflies, pear sawfly, and rose sawflies (roseslugs). Some species web foliage on which they chew and feed. Hosts of other sawfly pests include alder, birch, oak, and poplar.",
        "identification": "Adults are usually 1/2 inch long or shorter and blackish or brownish overall with orange, red, or yellow. Their abdomen is broadly attached to the thorax; most other types of adult wasps have a narrow \u201cwaist\u201d between the abdomen and thorax. In addition to three pairs of legs on the thorax, larvae of sawflies that feed exposed on plants have six or more pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on their abdomen. There are five or fewer pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage.",
        "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After hatching from an egg, larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars (growth stages), then pupate and emerge as an adult. Most sawflies in California overwinter as eggs in plant tissue or as mature larvae (prepupae) in litter, topsoil, or on hosts. Depending on the species and location, sawflies have from one to several generations per year.",
        "damage": "Sawfly feeding varies greatly by species and includes larvae that chew openly on foliage, feed within leaves they roll or web with silk, or tunnel inside leaves or stems. Healthy trees and shrubs generally tolerate moderate defoliation, galling, or mining without significant loss of flowering, fruit yield, or plant growth. Species that sporadically become abundant and extensively defoliate hosts may cause decline and occasionally the death of conifers and plants that are young or already unhealthy from other causes.",
        "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on or inside a small portion of the plant. Most sawfly larvae that feed openly on foliage are relatively easy to control if thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides including carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). See the sawflies named above for more information on those species.

        "description": "This armored scale (family Diaspididae) can be a serious pest of nut and stone fruit trees and has numerous other hosts. Crawlers (mobile first instars) are bright yellow, about the size of the sharp end of a pin, and have well developed antennae, eyes, and legs. After settling to feed, crawlers lose their appendages and become immobile. Settled first instars soon secrete a white cover (the white-cap stage), which later darkens (the black cap). The cover of adults and older nymphs is gray or brown and gray with a raised, gold-colored nipple (skin of earlier nymph) near the center. As they grow the cover of males becomes elongate whereas the cover of females remains round. Female covers are 1/25 to 1/12 inch in diameter at maturity. The female body remains beneath the cover and is roundish or deltoid shaped, smooth, and yellow. At maturity the elongated male covers are smaller than covers of females. The adult male emerges from beneath its cover and is a delicate, orange insect with long antennae and one pair of wings. The cover of female San Jose scales resembles that of olive scale (Parlatoria oleae), except that the female olive scale\u2019s body beneath its cover is purple. Both species can occur on many of the same hosts, but olive scale is under excellent biological control and is rarely abundant unless its natural enemies are disrupted. Walnut scale (Diaspidiotus juglansregiae) also resembles San Jose scale, except that under its cover, the margin of the female\u2019s yellow body has distinct indentations. Walnut scale is often found in daisy-shaped groups that develop when male crawlers settle under the margin of the circular female cover and begin forming their elongated covers adjacent to their mother. Walnut scale is usually abundant only on ash, birch, and walnut. San Jose scale overwinters on bark mostly as the black cap (older first instars). In the spring, the scales grow and the roundish females become distinguishable from the elongated, immature males. Males molt four times, whereas females molt twice. Winged adult males begin emerging in March and April and females produce a sex pheromone that attracts the adult males. About a month after mating, the first generation of crawlers appears in about May. San Jose scale has 3 to 4 generations per growing season, taking about 7 to 8 weeks per generation during warm weather. San Jose scale generally is a serious pest only on nut trees and stone fruits. It sucks juices from limbs and twigs and injects a toxic saliva. When abundant, its feeding causes a loss of tree vigor, growth, and productivity and the death of limbs. If scales are abundant and not controlled, they can kill fruit spurs and scaffold limbs within 1 to 3 years and cause trees to decline. After deciduous plants drop their leaves in the fall, brown dead foliage often remains on heavily infested branches that were killed by the scale. A red halo is produced around a feeding site on 1-year-old green wood. San Jose scale can also be a pest on roses, generally only when the roses grow near infested fruit or nut trees. Hosts on which San Jose scale is generally not abundant enough to cause damage include acacia, aspen, cottonwood, maple, mulberry, poplar, pyracantha, and willow. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of hosts and references for more information. Numerous parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on San Jose scale as listed at ScaleNet. The twicestabbed lady beetle, a dark, pinhead-sized nitidulid beetle (Cybocephalus californicus), and tiny parasitic wasps, including Aphytis and Encarsia species, are important natural enemies of San Jose scale. To conserve (preserve) natural enemies and improve biological control of scales, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. If spraying insecticide is warranted, use horticultural or narrow-range oil or another insecticide least disruptive to biological control. Horticultural oil can be sprayed during the dormant season, except not on plum and walnut which may be damaged by dormant-season oil. If spraying during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers beginning in April with double-sided sticky tape and spray 2 to 3 weeks after the bright yellow, pin-point-sized scale crawlers are first observed in the tape traps. Alternatively, on high-value trees, use pheromone traps and degree-day monitoring to time applications as described in the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Almonds. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time applications using sticky tape traps.

        "description": "Nematodes are tiny (usually microscopic) unsegmented roundworms. Root knot nematodes are the most common nematodes attacking annual and perennial landscape plants, especially in warm, irrigated, coarse-textured soils (sand, sandy loam, and loamy sand). Many landscape tree and shrub species are hosts of root knot nematodes, as are many herbaceous ornamentals and common weeds. More than one root knot nematode species can occur at the same site. A plant species resistant to one species of root knot nematode may still be susceptible to other Meloidogyne spp. Root knot nematodes cause galls or swellings on roots of many broadleaf plants. Some infected plants, especially annual grasses and certain legumes, may exhibit no galls even though nematodes still reproduce on them. When roots infected with root knot nematodes are washed they may appear gnarled and restricted. Beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria often form nodules on the roots of beans and other legumes, but these rub off roots easily, while galls caused by root knot nematodes are truly swellings of the roots. Also, a thumbnail can easily be pressed into a nitrogen-fixing bacterial gall, but not into a root knot gall. There are many other causes of plant galls. Plant-feeding nematodes develop through six stages: egg, four juvenile stages, and adult. Many species can develop from egg to egg-laying adult in as little as 3 to 4 weeks when the soil is warm and moist. Root knot nematodes spend most of their active life cycle in galls on roots. First-stage juveniles stay in the egg. The second stage hatches from the egg and moves through soil to invade new sites, usually near root tips, causing root cells to grow into giant cells where the nematodes feed as second-, third-, and fourth-stage juveniles. As feeding continues, the plant produces a gall around the infected area. Mature females produce eggs in a small gelatinous mass on the root surface or inside the root. Adult females remain in roots and produce an egg mass. Males leave and move through soil to seek and mate with females. Boxwood, rose, and most fruit and nut trees can be damaged in landscapes by Meloidogyne spp. Many other species are hosts. Roots infected by nematodes may become attacked by other pathogens, including those causing crown gall, root and crown decays, and certain vascular wilt diseases. Root knot nematodes usually cause distinctive swellings on the roots of affected plants, which damage the water- and nutrient-conducting abilities of the roots. Galls can crack or split open, allowing entry of disease-causing microorganisms. Aboveground symptoms of a root knot nematode infestation include wilting during the hottest part of the day even with adequate soil moisture loss of vigor yellowing leaves other symptoms similar to a lack of water or nutrients Infested plants grow more slowly and produce fewer and smaller leaves and fruits. Damage is most serious in warm, irrigated, sandy soils. To confirm a root knot nematode infestation, you must collect appropriate root and soil samples and send them to a laboratory that can provide positive identification of the infesting species. Nematodes are difficult to manage because in most landscape situations you cannot directly reduce their numbers. The following practical nematode management methods are preventive: Use good sanitation to avoid introducing or spreading nematodes. Grow plant cultivars or species that are nonhosts or are resistant or tolerant to nematode damage. Provide good cultural care and appropriate growing conditions to reduce stress on plants and increase their tolerance of infestations. To avoid introducing nematodes into landscapes, use only amendments, soil, and plants obtained from a reliable supplier that presumably are free of pathogens. Do not allow drainage or irrigation water from around infested plants to run off onto soil around healthy plants as this spreads nematodes. Do not transfer soil from around infested plants to healthy plants. Thoroughly wash soil and plant parts from all equipment and tools used around infested plants before leaving that site. Work first in uninfested areas before working around plants or soil suspected of being infested with nematodes. Consider replacing severely damaged plants and replant with species or cultivars more tolerant of the specific nematodes present; for example, do not replant the same plant genera into the old site. See Pest Notes: Nematodes for more information.",

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/roundheadbore.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Most any woody species can become infested by longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae), also called roundheaded wood borers. The larvae chew inner bark and sometimes the wood of limbs, trunks, and main roots. Most species of longhorned beetles primarily attack trees that were already injured or stressed.",
        "identification": "Oval-shaped or round emergence holes in bark and cracked, stained, or oozing liquid on limbs or trunks are common symptoms of infestation by roundheaded wood borers. Exceptions include California prionus, Prionus californicus, which chews the surface of roots, then bores inside roots and pupates in soil; no bark damage or emergence holes may be evident aboveground. Foliage may discolor and wilt, limbs may die back, and branches or entire plants may die when infested by roundheaded wood borers. There are many causes of similar damage, including aeration deficit, cold temperatures, root-disease pathogens, water deficit and other types of bark- and wood-boring insects. To help distinguish the cause, assess whether plants are experiencing other maladies e.g., those named above. Examine unhealthy limbs for adult borer emergence holes, or cut beneath damaged or discolored bark and look for tunnels with frass (insect excrement) or the insects themselves. Adult roundheaded borers are medium to large, elongate, cylindrical beetles. Their long antennae (\"horns\") are often longer than their body length. Their body color varies by species. Adults can be dull brownish or gray, brightly colored, or a mix of pale and dark colors in a banded or spotted pattern. The larvae typically are creamy white, cylindrical in cross-section, elongate, and distinctly segmented. Species of Cerambycidae. Important introduced (exotic) species include eucalyptus longhorned borers and the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), which is established in the eastern United States and has been spreading westward. Several native longhorned beetles resemble ALB; they all are black and white patterned. Submit any suspected ALB to the county agricultural commissioner. The native poplar borer (Saperda calcarata) infests unhealthy aspen, cottonwood, poplar, and willow. The banded alder borer (or California laurel borer), California prionus, nautical borer (Xylotrechus nauticus), and Neoclytus conjunctus attack dying or recently killed oaks and other woody species. The roundheaded fir borer (Tetropium abietis) attacks and kills weakened firs that might otherwise have survived. For identification help, contact your local UC ANR Cooperative Extension office or consult A Photographic Catalog of the Cerambycidae of the New World by the California Department of Food and Agriculture and Screening Aid for the Cerambycidae of the Western U.S.A. (PDF) by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and U.S. Forest Service.",
        "life_cycle": "Females lay eggs in bark crevices, and the emerging larvae bore into the inner bark and sapwood. Some species bore deeper into the heartwood. Larvae chew increasingly larger mines as they grow, and pack their mines with frass and coarse wood debris. After pupation, the adult leaves a round or oval hole in the surface of the bark or wood. Longhorned beetles can take one or more years to complete one generation, but this can vary by beetle species, host quality, growing location, and time of the year. For example, during the spring and summer eucalyptus longhorned borers may complete their life cycle in 3 to 4 months; eggs laid during the fall and winter may require up to 9 months to develop into adults.",
        "damage": "Native species of roundheaded borers attack mostly damaged or dying plants; vigorous trees are rarely attacked. Certain introduced species can be serious pests, attacking and killing trees that appeared to be healthy before becoming infested by borers. The wood-boring larvae can be serious pests because their chewing damages plants\u2019 vascular system. Larval tunneling weakens limbs and trunks and can kill branches or entire plants.",
        "solutions": "Prevention is the primary method of preventing damage by longhorned beetles. Plant trees that are well adapted to the site conditions, provide proper cultural care, and protect trees from injuries. Appropriate irrigation is particularly important; plants are seriously damaged by irrigating too frequently or by providing too little water. Prune off dead limbs during the season when adult borers are not active. Promptly remove dead or dying trees. Do not store freshly cut wood near trees. Debark or solarize logs beneath clear plastic in the sun to prevent beetles from emerging from the wood and attacking nearby hosts. Except for pruning and general cultural practices that improve tree vigor, little can be done to control most boring insects beneath bark once trees are already significantly damaged or unhealthy. Larvae of the larger, shallow-boring species can sometimes be killed by probing tunnels with a sharp wire. This method is practical only on a small plant, and it is often difficult to know whether the wire has sufficiently penetrated the tunnel and killed the larva. For certain borers, especially valuable trees may be protected from further attack by a well-timed application of a broad-spectrum, persistent insecticide to bark, or in some instances certain systemic insecticides. However, unless trees are monitored regularly so that borer activity and attack can be detected early, and the type of boring insect is identified so an effective treatment method can be selected, pesticide use is likely to be too late and ineffective. Do not substitute insecticide applications for proper cultural care. Most borers are attracted to trees that are already unhealthy from other causes, and relying only on insecticide can allow trees to die from those other causes unless the growing environment and cultural practices are improved.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/raspberryhorntail.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This sawfly (Cephidae) mines inside the terminals of caneberries (e.g., blackberries and raspberries) and roses, causing shoot tips to wilt and die. This insect differs from the wood-boring horntails (Siricidae), although both groups are wasps (Hymenoptera).",
        "identification": "Cane terminals that wilt, then discolor and die are the obvious symptom of this pest's presence. Shoot dieback can also be caused by inappropriate irrigation, poor soil drainage and aeration deficit, root-decay pathogens, and certain other disorders and pests. It is important to correctly distinguish the cause because some maladies causing look-alike damage can kill affected plants. To determine whether raspberry horntail is present, examine stem terminals especially where the second and third leaves from the tip attach to the cane. This is where female wasps insert their eggs and cause a small, circular discoloration of the cane. Canes may also become slightly swollen when a larva has fed inside. Cut open the affected area to expose any tunnel with brown, granular frass (excrement) and sometimes an immature raspberry horntail or its cast skin. Larvae are cream-colored to white and cylindrical with distinct segments. The head is pale brown and at the rear end is a short spine. Larvae have three pairs of true legs immediately behind the head and grow up to 9/10 inch long. Raspberry horntail larvae have no prolegs (leglike appendages on the abdomen), unlike the six or more pairs of prolegs of sawfly larvae that feed openly on plants. Adults are broad-waist wasps, 1/2 to 3/4 inch long with elongate, cylindrical bodies. The females are mostly yellow and orangish with black. Males are mostly black with some yellow and orange. Eggs are 1/16 inch long, curved, oval, pearly white, and somewhat flattened with a point at one end. Several eggs can be laid in one stem, but only one larva per terminal survives.",
        "life_cycle": "Adults emerge and mate beginning in March and the females lay eggs that hatch within several days. The young larva feeds spirally just beneath the surface, girdling the terminal and causing it to wilt. The larva then chews and lengthens a tunnel in the cane as it feeds and develops through four or five, increasingly larger instars (immature stages) during spring and summer. The mature larva chews downward into cane pith and forms a silk-lined cell where it overwinters as a prepupa. In late winter to early spring, it pupates into an adult and chews a round, emergence hole in the cane. There is one generation per year in most locations. In some locations there may be two generations per year.",
        "damage": "Infested terminals wilt and discolor during the spring, then die back by late summer and sometimes break if not pruned off. Infestation may reduce the abundance of blossoms and fruit. Raspberry horntail does not seriously threaten the long-term health or survival of infested plants. ",
        "solutions": "Inspect canes regularly during spring and summer and prune off and dispose of wilted terminals. Make the cuts below wilted leaves and any stem swelling and discolored, egg-laying wound in canes. Pruning off damaged shoots greatly reduces the subsequent abundance of raspberry horntails and their damage, and within 1 or 2 years may eliminate an infestation. Insecticide sprays are not recommended. See The Cephid Stem Borers of California (PDF) for more information.

        "description": "At least three species of sawflies (Tenthredinidae) are occasional pests of roses in California. The most common is bristly roseslug (Cladius difformis). Occasional pests are the curled rose sawfly, or curled roseslug (Allantus cinctus), and the roseslug (Endelomyia aethiops), also called American, European, or common roseslug.",
        "identification": "Adults are stout, 3/8 to 2/3 inch long, and mostly black with orange or yellow, varying by gender and species. Adults have two pairs of wings with distinct veins and a broad waist, unlike most wasps (Hymenoptera) that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on at least six abdominal segments; unlike the five or fewer abdominal segments with prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. Take care to distinguish roseslugs from beneficial syrphid larvae that feed on rose aphids. Roseslugs occur near chewed or scraped leaves, while syrphids occur among aphids and do not chew on plants. Syrphid larvae have no true legs, while roseslugs have three pairs of short legs on the thorax. Bristly roseslug. Bristly roseslug in California occurs mainly in cooler areas, such as near the coast. Larvae are pale green or yellowish green with a brown head. They grow to about 3/4 inch long and have many, tiny, hairlike bristles. Young larvae chew off the surface of the underside of leaves, leaving windowpanelike damage. Older larvae chew holes through leaves. Curled rose sawfly. Larvae are green with rows of pale, short, stout projections (tubercles). The head is pale brown to yellowish with a black eye spot on each side. The larvae grow up to 3/4 inch long and often coil their bodies while feeding. They mostly chew entirely through leaves along the edges, leaving mostly veins. They may chew half-moon-shaped cuts in leaf edges that resemble the foliage clipping by leafcutting bees. At maturity, larvae of curled rose sawfly chew into stems and form a pupation chamber in pith. Roseslug. Larvae are mostly green on top and yellowish along their sides. They have a brown head and grow up to 1/2 inch long. The larvae of all ages chew off and scrape the upper surface of leaves, causing windowpanelike damage; they do not chew holes entirely through foliage.",
        "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Females insert small eggs in the margin of rose leaves. Larvae hatch and grow through about five, increasingly larger instars (growth stages). Depending on the species and situation, rose sawflies pupate in cocoons on leaves, in organic litter beneath plants, or in a cell in twigs or the stub end of cut roses. Rose sawflies in California have one or more generations per year.",
        "damage": "Larvae chew and scrape the leaf surface, chew entirely through foliage, or both varying by the age and species. Feeding by sawfly larvae can make foliage unsightly and when severe may reduce the subsequent blossoming, but does not threaten the survival of otherwise-healthy roses.",
        "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Handpick larvae or clip off and dispose of infested foliage if rose sawflies are on a small portion of the plant. Larvae are relatively easy to control if they are thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms.

        "description": "Holes in rose blossoms can be caused by chewing insects including Fuller rose beetle, hoplia beetle, and rose curculios. The rose curculio (Merhynchites bicolor) and western rose curculio (M. wickhami) feed on caneberries and roses. Adult rose curculios are red and black, hard-bodied, snout beetles (weevils) about 1/4 inch long. They have an elongated head and mouthparts, distinct antennae, and long, black legs. Eggs are oval, about 1/25 inch long, and occur hidden in the bracts and buds of flowers. They are white to yellowish, then darken before hatching. The legless, plump larvae have distinct segments and are pale orange to whitish with a brown head. Larvae grow up to 1/4 inch long and occur hidden in flower buds and rose hips (fruit). Larvae of rose curculio resemble those of the rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga. However, rose midge larvae grow to only 1/16 inch long and are rarely pests in California. Adults emerge from soil beginning in the spring and seek young flower buds. The females chew small holes in the rose buds or hips to feed and lay eggs there. Adults can be present from about April through July. Eggs hatch within a few days of being laid and the larvae feed hidden within bud tissues. Larvae develop in buds that remain on the plant and in buds that fall to the ground. Later in the season larvae also feed in rose hips. Mature larvae emerge from buds or fruit on the plant, drop to the ground, and burrow into top soil. Overwintering is as inactive, mature larvae (prepupae) in a cell in soil. In late winter or early spring when soil warms, larvae pupate and adults soon emerge. Rose curculios have one generation per year. Rose weevil adults chew and puncture feed on rose buds, calyxes, and peduncles (flower stems). Injured parts may drop prematurely or remain on the plant. If damaged buds remain viable enough to open, the petals show distinct rounded holes and ragged areas. Unless buds are inspected regularly, damage occurrence can be overlooked until the buds open and display the damaged petals. Adults also chew petals of opened blossoms. If blossoms and flower buds are not plentiful, adult rose curculios may feed on the tips of new rose shoots, causing the death of terminals. Adults may also chew the stem of buds, causing the buds to wilt and die. Adult females lay their eggs in buds and the larvae feed on the petals and receptacle area. Larval infested buds commonly drop instead of maturing into flowers. Where rose curculios have been a problem, consider avoiding and replacing cultivars that have been most susceptible to damage. Handpick adults and dispose of infested buds. Rose buds or entire rose bushes can be protected with netting; choose a material that allows sunlight and water to penetrate but excludes insects. Certain insecticides can also provide control. Hand picking is very effective for controlling adults. Once rose buds appear, inspect them regularly for the presence of adult weevils and their damage. Because rose curculios prefer certain cultivars (commonly yellow and white blossoms), keep records of which plants the weevils are found on and focus subsequent monitoring on those. Regularly clip off and dispose of damaged buds, rose hips, and spent blossoms to reduce the abundance of weevil larvae that may infest them. If alternative hosts such as blackberries, boysenberries, and raspberries are present, also monitor their buds and handpick any weevils and clip and dispose of damaged buds and fruit. Adult weevils commonly drop from plants when disturbed. Hold a wide-mouth container half full of soapy water beneath infested parts and shake or touch the plant where the weevils are feeding. This induces weevil adults to drop down into the soapy water and drown. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter, sandy) and not compacted or high in clay content. Soil must be warm (at least 60\u00b0F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. Late summer and fall may be the most effective application times. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) to soil or trunks may control both adults and larvae. Foliar sprays are generally not recommended. If plants are especially susceptible to damage and handpicking is inadequate, a persistent, broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied, such as carbaryl mixed with horticultural oil.

        "description": "The poplar and willow borer (a weevil, family Curculionidae) tunnels in and kills limbs of alder, birch, poplar, and willow.",
        "identification": "Adults are about 1/5 to 1/3 inch long and a mottled mix of whitish and black or brown or both. The rear one-third of the wing covers is bright white. The oval body is hard and bumpy on the top and sides. The small head is hidden when viewed from above. The head extends into a slender beak, which is characteristic of weevils (also called snout beetles). The oval eggs are white and about 1/30 inch (0.8 mm) in diameter. The legless larvae have obvious segments. They are whitish with a shiny reddish-brown head. Larvae grow to 1/4 inch long and when exposed are commonly curved or C-shaped. The oblong pupae are white and about 1/4 inch long. ",
        "life_cycle": "Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults emerge from galleries (tunnels) during spring through early fall and chew and feed innocuously on the bark of young shoots. Adults are active mostly in the evening and are inactive during warm parts of the day. When disturbed, they commonly feign death by folding their legs and dropping to the ground. Adults seldom fly and the females commonly lay eggs on the same plant from which they emerged after feeding inside as larvae. Adult females lay one to several eggs at the bottom of holes chewed in bark which are the depth of their beak. Females then pack the hole with frass (excrement). There are two periods of peak egg laying, about March through April and from July through September. After hatching and overwintering beneath bark, larvae develop through 4 or 5 increasingly larger instars. Young larvae mine partly around the stem, and then upward in the wood for up to 3 inches. Frass initially is expelled from holes in the stem, but later the frass accumulates packed in the galleries. Mature larvae pupate behind a fibrous frass plug at the opening of their tunnel. Development from egg to reproductive adult takes 1 to 3 years.",
        "damage": "This pest prefers willow but also infests alder, birch, and poplar. Adult weevils innocuously chew bark and lay eggs on current-year green shoots. The hatching larvae mine in the host stem, first girdling the phloem then tunneling into the woody xylem. Small-diameter stems can be completely girdled and killed. Lateral shoots commonly grow from where stems were killed, giving shoot terminals a bushy, crooked appearance. Stems not directly killed by larval mining are weakened, increasing their susceptibility to breakage. Irregular splits commonly develop in bark over the sites of larval feeding. Irregular holes may also be visible in bark. These tunnel entrances may contain a mixture of sap and moist, reddish brown and white frass. Frass may also be found in bark crevices and on the ground underneath tunnel entrances. Some infested stems become deformed with callused (rough) areas of bark, gall-like swellings, and dead bark. Other boring insects such as bark beetles and clearwing moths and certain plant pathogens such as canker and wood decay fungi are more likely to be present after the attack of poplar and willow borer.",
        "solutions": "Several parasitic wasps develop in and kill the borer larvae. Ants and birds commonly feed on the adults and larvae. But it apparently is not known whether natural enemies help to suppress the pest's abundance. Because the borer adults are sedentary and seldom fly, cultural and sanitation practices can minimize damage. Prune off and destroy infested stems to reduce the emergence of beetle adults, but do not remove too much of a plant's foliage and wood. After pruning out infested limbs, where the beetle's damage is intolerable, bark can be sprayed with a persistent, broad-spectrum insecticide such as permethrin or another pyrethroid (insecticides ending in \"-thrin\") during March and again in July. Potentially effective products are available only to professional pesticide applicators and one must be hired to make the applications. For how to get the services you want, consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. Reapplication of insecticide may be warranted in subsequent years to be effective because of the borer's extended life cycle and movement from other infested hosts. Note that some insecticides move after application and contaminate surface water, adversely affect aquatic organisms, or poison bees and natural enemies.

        "identification": "From a distance, palm leaf skeletonizer damage appears as brown splotches on the leaves. Close examination reveals that caterpillars have fed on the underside of fronds, leaving the veins intact. As feeding expands, the brown splotches enlarge. The pale-brown or cream-colored larva grows up to 3/5 inch long and feeds hidden with up to 100 other larvae in a tube of dark brown excrement. The gray to yellowish brown, night-flying moths are 1/4 inch long and as with the tiny eggs are easily overlooked.",
        "life_cycle": "The adults (moths) live 3 to 10 days, and they do not feed on palm leaves. Female moths lay masses of eggs in pinnae (leaflets) or segment folds of newly expanding leaves. The caterpillars (larvae) feed on and chew the surface of leaf tissue, causing skeletonization. As larvae feed, they spin a tough, long, silk tube in which and outside of they deposit their fine, brown frass. The caterpillars live in colonies of 35 to 100 individuals within a common tube. They are present throughout the year and can complete five generations per year in warm areas like Florida.",
        "damage": "Palm leaf skeletonizer attacks various palms, including Phoenix and Washingtonia spp. Larvae chew the surface of palm leaves, causing dark discolored blotches on leaves. Infested fronds become dry and brown and eventually die. Infested palms may appear unsightly, but are rarely killed by caterpillar feeding.",
        "solutions": "In an effort to eradicate this pest, palms are monitored and infested fronds are pruned off, sealed securely in plastic bags, and properly disposed of. After pruning off infestations, palms are sprayed with insecticide. Buy only pest-free plants from reputable local nurseries. Because the palm leaf skeletonizer likely arrived in California on nursery stock shipped from the southeastern United States, be especially vigilant looking for this pest on imported plants. If you find suspected palm leaf skeletonizers, report this to the county agricultural commissioner.

        "description": "At least ten Pissodes species of conifer twig weevils, or bark weevils, chew and feed on conifers in California. Hosts differ by the species of weevil and include Douglas-fir, pine, spruce, and true fir. Monterey pine weevil, Pissodes radiata, and certain other Pissodes spp. as larvae mostly feed beneath bark of the root crown and basal trunk of conifers that are already injured, severely stressed, or dying from other causes. Species such as white pine weevil, P. strobi, that feeds on young pine and spruce mainly bore in and kill shoot terminals of otherwise healthy hosts. Adults and mature larvae of Pissodes species are 1/6 to 1/4 inch long. Adults have an elongated head and mouthparts and distinct, bent antennae. Adults can fly, unlike those of certain other weevils. Adult white pine weevils are blackish with reddish-brown and white blotches and spots on the wing covers (elytra). Adults of some other Pissodes species are mostly brownish overall, have differently colored markings (e.g., yellow), or both. The oblong eggs are pale yellowish and occur under bark. The larvae are white to pale yellowish with a brown head capsule and occur under bark. When disturbed or exposed they commonly have a C-shaped posture. Note there are numerous potential causes of bark cankers and dying conifer shoots. See the table of symptom comparison in Pest Notes: Pitch Moths to help discriminate the likely cause(s) of damage to pines. To confirm that larvae of white pine weevil or other Pissodes spp. are the cause, cut or peel off bark from affected shoots and look for the presence of the insects, their tunnels, or the pupal chambers covered in wood fiber that persist after the adults emerge. Feeding by woodpeckers and their flaking off of bark can indicate that boring insects are present. Weevils develop through four life stages: adult, egg, larva, and pupa. In about April and May, adult white pine weevils puncture feed on terminal growth of the preceding year. In May and June, the females lay eggs in these terminals. The developing larvae feed beneath bark and the twig-boring species girdle and kill the main terminal (leader), but not until the new growth of the current year has elongated considerably. Small areas of oozing pitch may be visible on infested terminals. By late summer, the infested shoots wilt, then needles turn reddish and may drop prematurely. From August through fall, new adults emerge, chew and feed on shoots, then overwinter in organic litter on the ground. Some portion of the population may overwinter as mature larvae beneath bark, then in spring pupate and emerge as adults. There is one generation per year. Multiple life stages can be present at the same time during much of the year. Adults of Pissodes species chew foliage of small shoots, generally causing only minor damage. Larvae of white pine weevil feed and chew in the terminal shoots of pine and spruce that are about 6 to 30 years of age. These larvae bore in inner bark, vascular tissue, and the centers of small branches, stems, or treetops, killing the most-recent 2 years of terminal growth and stunting plant growth. Side shoots become new main terminals, resulting in severely distorted, bushy plants of reduced aesthetic quality. Some other twig-boring Pissodes kill only the current year's terminal growth, so the plant is less severely affected. Species that primarily feed under trunk bark are generally not the primary cause of tree damage; trees stressed or injured from other causes become attractive to the egg-laying adult females, which oviposit in bark near the soil line. The emerging larvae chew and bore in the root crown and trunk, causing unsightly cankers on bark. Provide valued plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care. When Pissodes infest the lower trunk, identify and if feasible remedy whatever is the primary cause of unhealthy conifers that caused trees to become attractive to bark weevils. To help control white pine weevil and other shoot-boring Pissodes, prune off and dispose of infested terminals before the weevils mature and emerge as adults. In plantations of pine and spruce, such as Christmas tree farms, spacing trees more closely during planting can reduce the proportion of terminals that become infested. Insecticide application is generally not recommended for these pests in landscapes. See White Pine Weevil from Oregon State University for more information and photographs.

        "description": "These sucking insects are occasionally bothersome but usually do not damage landscape plants in California. About one dozen planthopper families (e.g., Acanaloniidae, Delphaci\u00addae, Flatidae, Fulgoridae, and Issidae) and more than 100 species occur in California. Planthoppers are usually 1/2 inch or less in length and have several large spines on the hind legs. Adults commonly have a keel, ridge, or snoutlike projection on the front of the head. Nymphs of some species excrete pale wax on plant parts where they feed. Adult females of some species also cover their egg laying sites with white wax or other excretions. Planthoppers can be difficult to distinguish from many leafhoppers and spittlebugs, but in comparison planthoppers generally are broader with flatter sides. The location of antennae (below each eye on the sides of the head) distinguishes planthoppers from most other sucking insects. For example, leafhopper, spittlebug, and treehopper antennae occur between or in front of the eyes. Australian torpedo bug. Siphanta acuta is a harmless, exotic species established in at least southern California. Adults and nymphs are green and up to 1/4 inch long. At rest the adult wings are nearly triangular and the green wings have a pinkish outer margin. The nymphs excrete pale wax from their rear end. Spotted lanternfly. Lycorma delicatula is a damaging, exotic species to look out for that has established in the eastern United States. Adults are red and white with black spots and have a wingspan of nearly 2 inches. Early instars are black with white spots. The last (fourth) instar is black and red with white spots. The oblong eggs are brownish and laid end-to-end in groups of adjacent rows, but eggs can be obscured by a covering of wax deposited by the female. When abundant, their honeydew and white wax can accumulate at the base of infested plants. For more information see Spotted Lanternfly. Report any suspected findings of spotted lanternfly in California to the office of the local county agricultural commissioner. For more information see Lycorma delicatula (Hemiptera: Fulgoridae): A New Invasive Pest in the United States, Spotted Lanternfly, and Spotted Lanternfly: A Colorful Cause for Concern. Planthoppers develop though three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Adult females lay eggs in incisions they make in succulent plant parts. After hatching from an egg, planthoppers develop through four or five increasingly larger instars. Wing pads can be distinctive on the last instar, although the coloration may blend with the color of their body. Planthoppers can have several generations per year. Most planthoppers sucking feed on plant phloem. They can secrete sticky honeydew, whitish wax, or both, which may foul plant parts. The invasive spotted lanternfly that's not yet reported in California can cause plants to die back. It feeds on at least 70 species of plants and can become annoyingly abundant in landscapes. Tree of heaven, Ailanthus altissima, is an especially favored host on which the pest reproduces in great numbers. Crop hosts include apple, apricot, cherry, grape, hops, peach, and plum. Native planthopper species in California generally cause little or no noticeable damage to garden and landscape plants and are not pests. No control is recommended.

        "description": "Pit scales are named for the roundish depression that commonly forms in plant tissue where each scale nymph feeds. At least eight species occur in California. Most damaging are Asterodiaspis (=Asterolecanium) species of oak pit scales that feed on and can severely damage Quercus species. Pittosporum pit scale, Planchonia (=Asterolecanium) arabidis, damages and prefers ceanothus and Pittosporum tobira, but has a long host list. These scales are circular to oval and immobile except for briefly when they are recently hatched first instars (crawlers). Mature pit scales of most species are 1/10 to 1/20 inch in diameter. Pittosporum pit scale including its marginal wax fringe can be up to 1/5 inch long. The pit scales' color can be brown, gold, green, tan, yellow, or whitish. Generally the most distinctive feature is their damage, the round depressions (pits). The particular species can commonly be discerned by the hosts on which they occur. Agave pit scale, Asterolecanium agavis, in California has been reported only on Joshua tree, Yucca brevifolia. The large pit scale, Asterolecanium grandiculum, feeds on various Agave and Yucca species. Bamboo pit scale, Bambusaspis bambusae, most commonly infests bamboos (including Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, and Phyllostachys species) and is generally innocuous on its various other hosts. Euphorbia pit scale, Planchonia (=Asterolecanium) stentae, infests numerous plants in the Asclepiadaceae and Euphorbiaceae families. Euphorbia pit scale and the bamboo pit scale closely resemble the pittosporum pit scale, but lack the lengthwise fringe of white wax on top the body and at maturity are less than one-half as large as pittosporum pit scale. Euphorbia pit scale in California has been reported only in commercial nurseries. Pittosporum pit scale prefers ceanothus and pittosporum. Bush anemone, chaste tree, hebe, privet, and other plants can also be infested. See the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ScaleNet database for a complete list of the hosts of these scales. Pit scales develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs generally resemble adults but are smaller and have less wax in species that excrete wax. Once crawlers settle to feed, the scales remain fixed in the same spot the rest of their lives. For the species with well-known biology, they have one generation per year. Agave pit scale and large pit scale cause discoloration and pitting of Joshua tree foliage. These scales generally are not abundant and not significant pests. Bamboo pit scale may occur in large groups on leaves and stems but does not make pits. Their translucent green to yellowish body takes on color of host leaves or stems where they feed, so this species is easily overlooked. Late instars (older nymphs) excrete a waxy fringe around their body, causing them to resemble certain species of whiteflies. Oak pit scales can severely damage oaks. Distortion caused by their feeding is most noticeable on the bark of younger twigs. Surrounding the feeding pit is formed a doughnut-shaped swelling with the scale in the center. If there are large numbers of scales, the pits coalesce, making the twig surface appear dimpled and roughened. Feeding by oak pit scales can kill twigs, and the dead leaves remain on infested twigs through the winter. Abundant scales feeding year after year can kill young oaks and stunt the growth of older trees. Pittosporum pit scale leaves ring-shaped depressions in bark and causes twigs to become distorted and swollen. The scale commonly congregates on the growing tips where plant distortion can be so severe their feeding obliterates the individual pits. Infested leaves may be smaller than normal and twigs may die back. Agave pit scale, bamboo pit scale, and large pit scale are generally innocuous and no control is warranted. Oak pit scales and pit-making pittosporum scale can be controlled by thoroughly spraying terminals with horticultural oil in late winter or early spring, before buds open or new leaves are produced. Where infestations are severe, annual application of oil or adding a persistent insecticide such as bifenthrin or other pyrethroid may be needed to sufficiently reduce the abundance of scales and severity of their damage.

The beetles feed as larvae beneath bark and pupate in wood, then emerge from dead or dying trees as adults contaminated with nematodes. Before laying their eggs in unhealthy trees, adult beetles may fly to other pines to feed on foliage; nematodes can then leave the beetles and infect the new tree. If beetles feed on the foliage of healthy plants, the introduced nematodes may eventually contribute to the decline of that plant as they reproduce within the tree. Branch dieback is the most common symptom in native pines infested with pinewood nematodes. The unhealthy trees in which they are found have typically been damaged by other causes, such as root disease or improper care, and the nematodes may be a secondary invader.",

The wasp larva hatches and feeds internally on the aphid, killing it shortly before pupating. The skin of the dead aphid turns crusty and golden brown or black, a form called a mummy; the parasite larva pupates within, later cutting an exit hole to emerge as an adult wasp. The generation time of most parasites is quite short when the weather is warm, so once you begin to see mummies on your plants, the aphid population is likely to be reduced substantially within a week or two.

        "description": "Various palm species and especially Canary Island date palm are fed upon by several Rhynchophorus species weevils. The South American palm weevil, R. palmarum, is well established in Mexico and has spread to at least neighboring San Diego County where it is killing Canary Island date palms. The palm weevil, R. vulneratus, was found in limited portions of Orange County and apparently eradicated. Other exotic species of concern include the palmetto weevil, Rhynchophorus cruentatus, which is native to Florida and the Caribbean, and red palm weevil, R. ferrugineus, which is native to Southeast Asia. Whether any Rhynchophorus species in addition to South American palm weevil will become established in California is unknown. Adults are large snout beetles (family Curculionidae) about 1-1/2 inches long. Their color is variable and includes black overall, black with a red stripe, orange with black spots, or dark with colored blotches on the pronotum (topside behind the head). Larvae grow up to 2 inches long and are legless, plump, and yellowish to white with a brown head. Mature larvae (prepupae) and pupae occur in a chamber of coarse palm fibers in tissue where they fed as larvae. Unless the trunk and especially the growing point at the top of the trunk are regularly examined (e.g., from a lift-bucket truck) infestations can be easily overlooked until palms are irrecoverably damaged. Periodically inspect trunks and use binoculars to observe fronds and detect any chewing damage that can indicate infestation by giant palm weevil. If dieback of the apical (center, newest, uppermost) leaves is observed, carefully inspect their base for larval mines and frass (excrement). When trimming palms, direct workers to look for weevil life stages and signs of their presence. Indications of giant palm weevil infestation include a fermented odor from the upper trunk empty pupal cases or dead weevil adults around the base of palms gnawing sounds from trunks, caused by the large larvae chewing inside truncated or cut-off leaf tips, which may be visible from the ground using binoculars tunnel openings on the trunk or base of fronds that exude chewed plant material or viscous liquid weevil adults, which can be caught in special traps Be sure to distinguish introduced Rhynchophorus weevils from the native giant palm borer, Dinapate wrighti, Bostrichidae; their adults and larvae can be the same color and length. Giant palm borer is a secondary pest that infests palms after they become severely stressed or are already dying. Adults of giant palm borer are cylindrical with a bulbous head that lacks the elongated mouthparts of weevils. Unlike weevil larvae, larvae of giant palm borer have prominent legs. Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults live about 2 to 3 months feeding on palms and going through several cycles of mating and egg laying. Adult females use their long mouthparts to chew a hole into palm tissue and lay eggs into the hole. Egg laying commonly is done in cracks and crevices and wounds in the trunk, from the collar region near the roots up to the base of frond petioles and the leaf crown. Each female lays several dozen to a few hundred eggs, which hatch in about 1 to 6 days. Emerging larvae chew and feed on palm tissue and bore into the center of the palm. Their tunnels fill with frass (excrement) and plant sap. Larvae develop through 3 to 7 increasingly larger instars for about 2 months. Mature larvae pupate in cocoons of palm fibers in the trunk or base of palm fronds. The pupal stage lasts from about 11 to 45 days. One generation from egg to adult takes 45 to 140 days, the shorter period when temperatures are warmer. Palm weevils have several generations per year. Adults chew and feed on fronds, giving them a ragged appearance that reduces the aesthetic value of palms. Chewing damage weakens plants if feeding is extensive. The most serious damage is from larval feeding. Larvae chew and feed in the apical growing point of Canary Island date palm and in the trunk and root collar (basal trunk) of various date palms. Larvae damage or kill fronds by chewing in tissue where fronds attach to the trunk. This causes a sparse canopy of few fronds, seriously weakens the trunk structure, and can kill date palms and cause collapse of the crown. Heavily infested date palms may break at the trunk. When Canary Island date palm is heavily fed upon, the entire leaf crown may drop. Do not bring palms or other plants into California unless you know they were inspected by agricultural officials or certified to be pest free. Report any suspected findings of giant palm weevils to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. Use good sanitation to prevent palm weevils from spreading from infested palms. Where palms are found to be infested with giant palm weevils, remove the plant and burn, chip, or deeply bury the infested material. Plant resistant species, such as the native California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera), European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), or non-palm species.

        "description": "This armored scale (family Diaspididae) generally damages only poplars and especially willows. Populations are generally innocuous on its numerous other hosts. The cover of nymphs is silver gray and that of adult females is coppery brown to purplish. The covers are elongate and narrow at one end and wider and rounded at the other end, resembling miniature oysters. Mature females are about 1/8 inch long. Nymphs and adult females are found on bark, commonly in crowded clusters. Males of this species are not known to occur. At least nine similar-looking Lepidosaphes species occur in California. The look-alike purple scale, Lepidosaphes beckii, generally is common only on bark and leaves of citrus in coastal areas. Both oystershell scale and purple scale can infest broadleaf evergreens, such as boxwood, citrus, and holly. But unlike purple scale, oystershell scale does not infest leaves. The similar fig scale, Lepidosaphes conchiformis, generally is common only on Ficus carica. Fig scale and oystershell scale can both occur on elm, fig, and walnut. But fig scale occurs on bark and leaves and mature females are 1/12 to 1/16 inch long, noticeably smaller than mature females of oystershell scale, which do not infest leaves. Females of euonymus scale, Unaspis euonymi, and oystershell scale also resemble each other and both can infest euonymus. However euonymus scale infests bark, green stems, and leaves and the elongate, white covers of males are common; oystershell scale lacks males. Oystershell scale overwinters as whitish eggs under the cover of mature females on bark. The crawlers (mobile first instars) emerge in the spring after buds have burst. Nymphs develop through two increasingly larger instars. The scale usually has one generation per year in Northern California and two generations in Southern California. The scale sucks and feeds on bark. High populations over several years can kill twigs and branches on young poplars and especially willows. Prolonged, abundant scales can stunt the growth of mature poplars and willows and cause them to decline. Except for poplars and willows, oystershell scale is generally not a significant pest in California on about 150 other plant species it feeds on including alder, almond, ash, aspen, box elder, boxwood, ceanothus, fruit trees, holly, maple, sycamore, and walnut. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of hosts of this species and references for more information. Horticultural or narrow-range oil provide control if plants are small enough to be sprayed. Thoroughly spray infested bark when crawlers are active in late winter or spring. If plants are tall or located where spray may drift to adjacent properties, a soil drench or bark spray of certain systemic insecticides (e.g., dinotefuran) may be the best option. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time applications by monitoring scale crawlers using sticky tape traps.

        "description": "Larvae of this group of moths (family Tortricidae) chew and feed inside of and on pine needles and terminals. Rhyacionia species are pests primarily in Southern California and on Monterey pine, especially when the pine is planted away from the coast. Nantucket pine tip moth (R. frustrana) and near the coast the Monterey pine tip moth (R. pasadenana) are the major pests, attacking most pine species with two or three needles per bundle. Ponderosa pine tip moth (R. zozana) mostly damages young, planted pines grown away from the coast.",
        "identification": "Dead brown or reddish shoots noticeable from a distance are the most obvious symptom of infestation. Silk webbing and boring frass (insect excrement) are visible during close inspection of discolored terminals. Because other causes can produce similar damage, see the table in Pest Notes: Pitch Canker to help you discriminate among the insects and pathogens that cause shoot dieback of pines. Adults, mature larvae, and pupae are about 2/5 inch long. The adults are reddish brown moths with silver-gray markings. Eggs are spherical, orange or yellow, and occur on needles of hosts. Young larvae are whitish with a dark head. Older larvae are yellow to pale brown with a dark head.",
        "life_cycle": "Tip moths develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults (moths) begin emerging in January in Southern California. The female lays tiny eggs singly on the new growth tips where the young larvae occur on or inside of buds, needles, and shoot terminals. Summer-generation larvae pupate in the tips. Overwinter pupae commonly occur in litter on the ground. The Nantucket pine tip moth has about four generations per year in Southern California. Monterey pine tip moth and Ponderosa pine tip moth have one or two generations per year.",
        "damage": "Larvae chew in and on pine buds, needles, and terminals and cover infested shoot tips with fine silk. Their boring in shoots causes pitch to exude. Infested terminals discolor and die. Larval damage to the central growing terminal (leader) can significantly alter tree shape, causing regrowth of stems to be bunchy, crooked, or forked. The aesthetic quality of infested pines is marred, for example making them unsuitable for marketing as Christmas trees. However, tip moth feeding does not threaten tree survival, and pines appear to be less affected as they age.",
        "solutions": "If little or no damage can be tolerated, do not plant pine species particularly susceptible to tip moth damage. Consider replacing susceptible species like Monterey pine if their performance is unacceptable. Alternatively, tolerate the damage. Provide proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation, to increase tree tolerance to damage. The introduced ichneumonid wasp Campoplex frustranae parasitizes Nantucket pine tip moth larvae and pupae. This natural enemy has reduced moth populations in many locations, resulting in improved vigor and healthier appearance of pines. Adults are 1/4 inch long and blackish to dark brownish wasps with long antennae and orange legs. Other parasites of pine tip moths include Habrobracon cushmani. See Natural Enemy Promises Control of Nantucket Pine Tip Moth from UC Riverside for more information. Prune off and dispose of infested tips from October through January to prevent overwintering moths from emerging. If high-value pines must be pruned during other times, monitor adults with sticky traps baited with the Rhyacionia pheromone (sex attractant). Destroy larvae and pupae by pruning infested shoots between the peak moth catches representing each generation of adult flights. Alternatively, to kill young larvae apply a systemic insecticide (e.g., acephate, dinotefuran, imidacloprid) or spray foliage with a broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticide such as carbaryl, permethrin, or another pyrethroid (insecticides ending in \"-thrin\") soon after moths are observed flying during each generation. However, insecticide usually is not justified unless trees are of especially high aesthetic value. Insecticide spray can cause spider mite outbreaks and wash off and pollute surface waters. Spraying also kills natural enemies such as Campoplex frustranae, which can provide substantial biological control of this pest. Some of these insecticides including carbaryl, dinotefuran, and pyrethroids potentially effective for this pest are not available to home gardeners. A professional applicator must be hired to make these applications. For how to get the services you want, see Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. Monitoring and treating high-value pines. Insect activity varies with temperature, and foliar spraying and pruning are more effective if they are performed between the peak moth flight periods. To monitor flights, hang one sticky trap baited with tip moth pheromone at chest height in the outer canopy of each of two trees at least 50 feet apart from January through September. On properties with extensive pine plantings deploy additional traps at approximately 500-foot intervals. Inspect each trap daily. Remove any debris, count the Rhyacionia moths caught, record their numbers, and remove any moths in the traps. Replace traps when the sticky surface becomes dirty or clogged with moths and replace the pheromone lure about every 4 weeks or as recommended by suppliers. If pruning or spraying of a residual foliar insecticide are performed, do so 10 to 14 days after the beginning of an overall decline in the number of first-generation moths caught and again about 1 week after the peak number of each subsequent generation of moths. If spraying foliage, thorough coverage of all branch tips and the treetop is important for providing control. For the most effective control timing use degree-day (temperature) monitoring and moth traps. Spray foliage or prune at about 1,233 degree-days after the beginning of each moth generation, using a lower development threshold temperature of 42\u00b0F and an upper threshold of 99\u00b0F. The first generation begins in the spring when the first moth is caught. Subsequent generations start when moth catches first begin increasing after a dramatic decline in numbers from the previous peak. Enter the threshold temperatures above in the UC IPM degree-day calculator and select the weather station nearest your pine trees to most effectively time control actions.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/oleanderscale.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Also called ivy scale or white scale, this armored scale (family Diaspididae) may be the most common scale insect in California. While unsightly when abundant it rarely, if ever, causes serious harm to plants. Oleander scale\u2019s cover is nearly circular, flattened, and found on bark, foliage, and fruit. Female covers are tan to yellowish and at maturity 1/16 to 1/12 inch in diameter. The cover of immature males is smaller and translucent white. Through the cover, the male body is partly visible. The easily overlooked adult male is about 1/25 inch long and has a delicate, orangish body with long antennae and one pair of wings. Oleander scale resembles greedy scale and latania scale, but their covers are more globular or raised. The darker, raised bump (exuvia, cover of the earlier nymphal stage) of oleander scale is commonly near the scale's center; the exuvia of greedy and latania scales is near the side of their covers. It is difficult to reliably separate these species in the field, but this generally is not of practical importance as these three species generally do not damage hosts or warrant management. Note that cycad scale is another look-alike species and it is a serious pest of cycads, or sago palms (Cycas and Zamia species). In comparison with oleander scale, cycad scale on sago palms is lighter colored, more convex, and commonly oblong. Submit samples to an expert with the county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension for identification if it is uncertain what species is infesting cycads. Greedy scale, latania scale, and oleander scale generally can be ignored, while cycad scale when abundant on cycads warrants management action. Armored scales develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Oleander scale overwinters as mature females, which produce crawlers (mobile first instars) beginning in late winter. Female nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages and males develop through four immature stages before maturing into adults. There are two to four generations per year in California. The scale sucks and feeds mostly on leaves, but occasionally also on stems. The pale scale covers can give foliage a crusty appearance, reducing aesthetic appearance. Otherwise, oleander scale generally does not damage hosts or threaten plant health. Oleander scale can infest over 300 genera of plants as listed at ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The most common hosts of oleander scale include aucuba, cycad or sago palm, ivy, oleander, and olive. Its many other hosts include acacia, bay, boxwood, fruit trees, holly, laurel, magnolia, manzanita, maple, mulberry, pepper tree, redbud, rose, yew, and yucca. No control is needed to protect plant health. If unsightly, prune out heavily infested branches as long as this does not entail extensive removal of a plants' leaves and limbs. Numerous parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on oleander scale as listed at ScaleNet. Predators include the black lady beetle (Rhyzobius lophanthae), green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and twice-stabbed lady beetle. To conserve (preserve) natural enemies and improve biological control, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Where intolerable, horticultural or narrow-range oil can be sprayed to thoroughly cover infested parts during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in late winter or spring. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time applications by monitoring scale crawlers using sticky tape traps.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/oaklfphyll.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "These phylloxera are soft-bodied aphidlike insects that suck and feed on the underside of oak leaves. This feeding causes small, brown and yellow spots that are visible on both sides of infested leaves. Oak leaf phylloxera adults and nymphs (immatures) are oblong or pear shaped and tapered toward the rear end. They are 1/25 inch (1 mm) or less in length and a hand lens is required to clearly distinguish the individual insects. Adults and nymphs of most California species are yellow to orange, including Phylloxera davidsoni, P. querceti, P. reticulata, and P. stanfordiana. Phylloxera rileyi is dark brown with blackish tubercles (raised bumps) on top of the body. The yellow eggs are oblong and 1/50 inch (0.5 mm) or less in length. The biology of oak leaf phylloxera has not been well studied in California. The true species identity of at least some of these insects is uncertain. Phylloxera develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Most egg laying is done by wingless adult females. At least some species produce winged adults. The nymphs develop through several increasingly larger instars. Oak leaf phylloxera are generally most abundant in late summer and fall. They overwinter as eggs in bark crevices and perhaps as young nymphs on twigs. These phylloxera have multiple generations per year. Oak leaf phylloxera suck and feed on the underside of the leaves of Quercus species. Some species, and the discolored, roundish spots from their feeding, are most abundant along the leaf veins. Others feed more scattered throughout the leaf underside. Where each phylloxera feeds the leaves develop a roundish spot about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) in diameter that initially is bright yellow then darkens to brown. Heavily infested leaves may drop prematurely late in the growing season. Hosts include blue oak, Engelmann oak, Oregon white oak, and valley oak. In British Columbia repeated premature defoliation of certain oaks by P. glabra sometimes kills the tree. But this phylloxera species, inadvertently introduced from Europe, has not been reported in California. The oak leaf phylloxera species in California appear to be of minor importance and have no apparent adverse effect on tree health. Management has not been investigated in California. Oaks appear to tolerate phylloxera feeding on their foliage in California. No control is warranted to protect plant health. Various predatory insects feed on oak leaf phylloxera. These include Anthocoris species minute pirate bugs, brown lacewings, green lacewings, and lady beetle (ladybug) adults and larvae including those of Axion plagiatum and multicolored Asian lady beetle. Where their aesthetic damage cannot be tolerated, based on recommendations from the Pacific Northwest, the underside of the leaves of smaller oaks can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil or insecticidal soap to reduce these pests' abundance and subsequent feeding damage.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/oaktwiggirdler.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This flatheaded borer (family Buprestidae) infests and kills twigs of tanoak and true oaks, especially coast live oak in Southern California. Other hosts include California black oak, canyon live oak, Engelmann oak, interior live oak, and valley oak. The presence of oak twig girdler is indicated by scattered patches of whitish brown leaves throughout the canopy. Leaves are dead but have not been chewed and exhibit no surface scraping. Except for adults, all life stages occur hidden beneath bark. Adults are dark coppery brown beetles about 1/4 inch long. Eggs are long, narrow, and whitish. Larvae are white to pale yellow with brown mouthparts. The larval body has distinct constrictions between each segment and enlarged segments immediately behind the mouthparts. To confirm oak twig girdler as the cause of damage peel back bark at the junction between dead and live twigs. Look for tunnels that spiral around the twig and are packed with dark, granular frass (excrement). A tunnel may also contain a beetle larva or pupa. Various other insects and plant pathogens can cause similar, scattered dieback on oaks. These include plant pathogens that cause oak branch canker and dieback and oak twig blight. Less-common boring insects that cause similar damage include at least two roundheaded borers, Aneflomorpha lineare and Styloxus fulleri (family Cerambycidae), and a false powder post beetle Scobicia suturalis (family Bostrichidae). These insects look distinctly different than the adults and larvae of oak twig girdler. The adult oak twig girdler emerges around June in coastal areas and May at inland locations. The eggs are laid singly on young twigs. The hatching whitish larva chews inside and for 3 to 6 months creates a linear mine several inches long. It then mines spirally and girdles the twig, causing foliage terminal (outward) from the mining to die and turn brown. During the next growing season the larva mines a foot or more down the branch toward the trunk, causing more foliage to die. It then bores back outward in the center of the branch, pupates just under the surface, and emerges as an adult. The development from egg to adult requires about 2 years. Oak twig girdler larvae chew and feed inside small branches, causing the shoot terminal and attached leaves to die. Although this damage can be unsightly, oak twig girdler does not significantly impair tree health. Provide trees with proper cultural care and good growing conditions. Drought-weakened oaks are especially prone to twig girdler attack and other pest problems. Because urbanization often reduces the natural availability of soil moisture, even drought-adapted trees may warrant infrequent, deep watering. Prune infested branches to restore the oak\u2019s aesthetic quality. At least six species of parasitic wasps attack oak twig girdler; however, their importance in biological control has not been documented. Because damage by this pest does not affect tree survival and insecticide application kills natural enemies, no further management is recommended.

        "description": "Distorted, sometimes colorful swellings in branches, flowers, leaves, or twigs caused by gall wasps (Cynipidae) are especially abundant and varied on oaks. Cynipid gall wasps also can infest rose and certain other hosts. The size, shape, and color of the galls depends on the species of wasp and host and the plant part infested.",
        "identification": "Adult cynipids are usually purple or black, small, stout insects that have clear wings with few veins. The appearance of galls and wasps and the part of the plant attacked often differ between generations. The abundance of cynipids and their new galls varies greatly from year to year. Certain gall wasps contribute to annoying problems, such as leaf or twig dieback or messy dripping. Certain Andricus, Disholcaspis, and Dryocosmus spp. gall wasps induce plants to secrete copious sticky nectar.",
        "life_cycle": "Oak gall wasps alternate between one sexual and one asexual generation each year. Several weeks or months after egg laying by the female wasp, a gall forms as one or more white larvae feed inside. Galls on woody parts and evergreen foliage can persist long after the wasp larvae have completed feeding and emerged from the galls.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Provide oaks with proper environmental conditions and good cultural care. No other management is recommended because gall wasps can be very difficult to control, and usually they do not seriously harm oaks. Gall wasps are naturally killed by a complex of fungi, parasites, predators, and competing insects (primarily moth larvae and other wasps) that live within galls. Cynipids are also preyed upon by various small insectivorous birds, woodpeckers, and small mammals. If nectar-producing gall wasps are the problem, controlling ants can gradually (over several years) help to dramatically reduce nectar-inducing gall wasp populations by allowing gall wasp competitors and parasites to become more abundant. In most situations, no controls have been shown to be effective. Certain leaf-galling species may be reduced by insecticides with systemic or translaminar (leaf-penetrating) activity applied in late winter to spring, or by a broad-spectrum, residual insecticide foliar spray timed to coincide with leaf bud break or the early expansion of new leaves. However, gall wasps are unlikely to be well controlled by any single treatment; sometimes insecticide provides no control at all. Avoid using residual, broad-spectrum foliar sprays because they can induce outbreaks of other oak pests and wash off and pollute surface water.",

        "description": "Oak ambrosia beetles, Monarthrum dentiger and M. scutellare, and the western oak bark beetle, Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis, infest injured and unhealthy California buckeye (horse chestnut), tanoak, and true oaks. These Scolytinae are commonly found in oaks dying from Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death (SOD). The first obvious symptom of infestation by these beetles is fine, powdery, boring dust and excrement (frass) that accumulates on the bark surface and around the tree\u2019s base. Adult beetles push the boring dust out of small holes (each about 1/20 inch diameter) in the bark, and the holes may be visible on the surface of infested branches and trunks. The beetles can be discriminated: Oak ambrosia beetles produce whitish frass around their tunnel openings. The frass is whitish because ambrosia beetles bore deeply under bark, mostly in the pale-colored heartwood and sapwood. Western oak bark beetle adults produce reddish frass on the surface of bark. Their frass is dark to red because they bore mostly in oak\u2019s reddish inner bark (phloem). The adults are small, dark brown to blackish, cylindrical beetles about 1/10 to 1/6 inch long. The larvae occur under bark and are white, legless, and have a dark head capsule. When disturbed and exposed the larvae commonly are C shaped. Be aware that oaks can also be infested with other similar-looking Scolytinae including the invasive shothole borers Kuroshio shothole borer and polyphagous shothole borer. Ambrosia and bark beetles develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Except for the adults, all stages are found only under bark. In northern California the beetles have about two generations per year. Most first-generation adults emerge from hosts and fly during about March. The second generation emerges in about September. The adult beetles reinfest the same tree or move to find new hosts. Because beetles develop at different rates and from eggs laid at various times, some adults may be flying and seeking stressed hosts to lay their eggs in anytime from about March through October. Each beetle spends most of its life in the larval stage. The second (fall) generation of beetles feeds and overwinters as larvae in the host. Oak ambrosia beetles. Ambrosia beetles tunnel and breed beneath bark, but they feed on fungi they introduce and grow in the galleries (tunnels). Male Monarthrum species tunnel through the bark and about 2 inches deep into sapwood. The female joins the male, mates, and introduces the ambrosia fungi. Both sexes excavate 2 to 4 diverging galleries about 2 to 6 inches deep into heartwood and sapwood. The female lays eggs in niches in the sidewalls of the galleries. The emerging larvae lengthen the egg niches and feed on ambrosia fungi that grow there. Larvae feed for 3 to 4 months, then pupate into adults that emerge through the same entrance holes made by parent beetles. Western oak bark beetle. Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis is a true bark beetle; the larvae chew and feed on phloem and outer xylem tissues. Although it does not feed on fungi, western oak bark beetle can spread plant pathogens, such as the Geosmithia pallida fungus that causes foamy bark canker on coast live oak. Female western oak bark beetles chew a tunnel about 2 inches long between the bark and wood and lay eggs there. After hatching the western oak bark beetle larvae mine upward and downward with the grain into the inner bark. Mature larvae pupate just beneath the bark surface, then as new adults chew individual, new holes through which they emerge. These beetles do not attack otherwise-healthy trees that are vigorous. They attack stressed, dying, and recently dead hosts. Their tunneling injures trees' vascular system and weakens tree structure. Once trees become attacked by these beetles they have a greatly increased risk of structural failure (e.g., limb drop, trunk breakage) and are likely to die prematurely. Prevention is the only available control. Plant only species well adapted for the conditions at that location. Plant properly, protect tree roots and trunks from injuries, and provide good cultural care. Avoiding inappropriate irrigation is particularly important. California buckeye, tanoak, and native true oaks are adapted to summer drought. They are readily damaged by frequent irrigation beneath their canopies, such as when turfgrass is planted underneath them. Remove hazardous limbs whenever they appear, but otherwise avoid pruning during the season when egg laying adult borers are active (March through October). Prune out and dispose of borers restricted to a few limbs. Remove and dispose of dying trees to prevent boring insects from emerging and attacking other hosts. Do not pile unseasoned, freshly cut wood near woody landscape plants. Freshly cut wood or trees that are dying or recently dead provide an abundant breeding source for many wood-boring pests. Solarize recently cut wood to kill most beetles infesting it. For more information, see A Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of California Oaks and the Pest Notes: Bark Beetles.

        "identification": "The damage, larvae, and pupae of Monterey pine bud moth closely resemble those of Monterey pine tip moth. Monterey pine can be infested with both species at the same time. A way to distinguish the species is to rear larvae or pupae to adults, such as by placing infested shoots in a ventilated container until adults emerge. Freeze the adults for several minutes to kill them. Allow them to thaw and examining the wing markings, which differ by species. The adult of Monterey pine bud moth is a mostly reddish brown moth with black blotches and three, transverse, white bands on each front wing. The antennae are distinctly and alternately ringed with dark brown and white. The hind wings are uniformly covered with brown scales and have a wide fringe of hairs on the rear edge. Larvae of Monterey pine bud moth are yellowish brown with a black head. They grow up to 1/4 inch long and are found in mined shoots and (when larvae are young) inside buds and needles. The brownish pupa is slightly shorter than the mature larva.",
        "life_cycle": "The adults are generally present from late April to June in Southern California and somewhat later in Central California. Single eggs are laid at the base of buds that will grow into shoots during the next growing season. The newly hatched larvae tunnel into buds and a modest amount of tunneling in shoots is done by young larvae during the current year. They overwinter as fourth-instars (old larvae). During spring, the overwintered larvae resume feeding. Their tunneling damage becomes more extensive and external symptoms become more apparent. As spring warms, the tunneled shoots begin to discolor, wilt, and die. Pupation usually takes place in the tunnel of the dried shoot, most often near a small hole. The pupal stage lasts 2 to 3 weeks. The adults then emerge, mate, and females lay eggs. There is only 1 generation per year. ",
        "damage": "Larvae of Monterey pine bud moth chew and feed on the buds, needles, and shoot tips of Monterey pine and other Pinus species. Their tunnels generally extend only 1 or 2 inches within terminals. Infested buds and shoot tips are killed and regrowth of the terminal is commonly crooked. Note that pine tip moths cause very similar damage. Larvae of the Monterey pine bud moth make small mines in the center of the new buds and developing tips, causing them to wither, die, and become brown and dry. When the moth is abundant, most of a pine's shoot tips can be killed and the aesthetic value of the tree is decreased. Tips injured by the bud moth continue to grow for 6 or 7 inches before dying. In contrast, pine tip moth larva chew away most of the inside of the developing tip, causing the growth to stop abruptly and the tip to quickly die.",
        "solutions": "Insecticide application generally is not warranted unless trees are of especially high aesthetic value, such as in Christmas tree farms. Where tip damage has been intolerable, apply a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) to kill young larvae. To avoid drift from spraying and to avoid trunk injury from injecting insecticide the preferred application method is to drench imidacloprid onto soil around the base of the trunk. Alternatively, spray foliage with a broad-spectrum, residual pyrethroid insecticide (e.g., permethrin or other insecticide ending in \"thrin\") soon after moths are observed flying in spring or early summer. Note that pyrethroids effective for this pest are available only to professional pesticide applicators and a professional with access to effective products must be hired to make the application. For how to get the services you want, consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. Be aware that application of a pyrethroid or certain other insecticides can cause spider mite outbreaks and wash off into storm drains and pollute surface waters at concentrations toxic to some aquatic life.

        "description": "Minute cypress scale, an armored scale (Diaspididae), is also called cypress scale. It can occur on almost any conifer and is common on arborvitae, cypress, and juniper. Minute cypress scale usually is a serious pest in landscapes only on Italian cypress, Cupressus sempervirens, and in nurseries on various conifer species.",
        "identification": "The alternative name cypress scale is also applied to species including the cypress bark mealybug (cypress bark scale) and incense cedar scale (Monterey cypress scale). The foliage discoloration and twig dieback caused by minute cypress scale can resemble that caused by the larvae (caterpillars) of certain moths, including cypress tipminer, juniper twig girdler, and webworms such as cypress leaftier, cypress webber, and juniper webworm. These species can occur together. To help diagnose the cause of damage, shake foliage to see if numerous tiny moths are dislodged. Look for caterpillars and silk produced by larvae of these moths. The caterpillars grow to 1/4 inch or longer and chew and feed on or inside of foliage. Use a hand lens to inspect discolored foliage for the scales, which are 1/16 inch long or less and do not produce silken strands. The cover of mature females of minute cypress scale is circular, convex, and whitish with a brown to yellow center. The scale body under the cover is greenish and yellow. The cover of immature males is elongate, feltlike, and with longitudinal ridges; on the terminal of males' mostly whitish cover is the brown or yellow exuvia (cover of the earlier, nymphal stage). Juniper scale. Carulaspis juniperi in the field cannot be distinguished from minute cypress scale. Both species can be present. The covers of both species are circular to elongate, tiny, and found on leaves and stems.",
        "life_cycle": " Minute cypress scale overwinters as females, which mature and produce crawlers (mobile, first instars) in late winter and spring. Nymphs feed through the summer, develop into adult females or males, and mate. Males die by the fall and only females are present during the winter. There are one to two generations per year in California.",
        "damage": "The scale feeds by sucking plant juices from leaves (needles) and twigs. Severe infestations can cause foliage to turn yellow or brown and die. Although minute cypress scale is widespread in California, it generally is not a serious pest in landscapes. It can be a serious pest in nurseries.",
        "solutions": "Generally no control is warranted in landscapes where the scale's populations are commonly innocuous. Parasitic wasps, predatory lady beetles, and other natural enemies commonly feed on and kill the scale. If scale damage is intolerable or adversely affecting plant health, thoroughly spray infested foliage with horticultural oil when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring. Use a different, effective insecticide if the product label indicates the host plant is sensitive to oil damage.

        "description": "Mealybugs are wingless, soft-bodied, insects about 1/20 to 1/5 inch long. They are usually elongate and segmented, and may have wax filaments radiating from the body, especially at the tail. Most females can move slowly and are covered with whitish, mealy or cottony wax. This waxy covering is similar to that produced by cottony cushion scales. Colonies occur as white, sticky clusters among leaves and fruit. Larvae are mobile. M ealybugs are often confused with woolly aphids.",
        "identification": "",
        "life_cycle": "Mealybugs overwinter as eggs or crawlers in protected places on the tree, such as crevices in the bark. The yellow to orange eggs are laid in a cottony mass called an ovisac. The young nymphs, or crawlers, are oblong, whitish, yellowish, or reddish and may or may not be covered with waxy filaments. In spring, crawlers move to the base of growing shoots or fruit clusters and stay until maturity (late May or June). As they mature, mealybugs become purple and develop a white powdery wax covering. Mature female mealybugs are about 3/16 inch long. Males are tiny two-winged insects that are rarely seen. Mature females return to protected places under the bark and lay eggs. Eggs also may be laid in the calyx end of the fruit such as apples. Eggs hatch in June, and the new generation of crawlers moves from the bark to tender shoots or fruit to feed with those hatched on the fruit. Adults of this generation move back to the bark in August or September and lay eggs for overwintering. Some of these eggs may hatch in the fall to produce crawlers that overwinter. Most mealybugs have several generations a year.",
        "damage": "Mealybugs tend to congregate in large numbers, forming white, cottony masses on plants. They feed on stems and leaves of fruit trees and ornamentals. High populations slow plant growth and cause premature leaf or fruit drop and twig dieback. Mealybugs can lower fruit quality by covering it with wax or sticky honeydew upon which black sooty mold grows.",
        "solutions": "Provide proper cultural control so that plants are vigorous and can tolerate moderate mealybug feeding without being damaged. Naturally occurring predators and parasites provide good control of many mealybug species, unless these beneficials are disrupted. Manage ants, which are attracted to honeydew and inhibit the activities of natural enemies. Removal of overwintering sites, such as loose bark, can reduce mealybug numbers. Populations often drop in summer. Mealybugs are difficult to control with insecticides and systemic materials may be required. On ornamentals, insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil, or a forceful stream of water can be applied to reduce exposed populations with minimal harm to natural enemies that may migrate in later. Mealybugs are sensitive to heat and their waxy coat protects them from insecticides. Treatments are usually not justified or effective on home fruit trees. For more information, see the Mealybugs Pest Note.",

        "description": "The manzanita leafgall aphid (Aphididae) causes leaves to swell into pod-shaped galls. At least one other species of aphid, Tamalia dicksoni, causes similar galls on the leaves of Arctostaphylos spp. shrubs. Heavily infested plants may grow slowly, but the galling is otherwise harmless to manzanita. Feeding by Tamalia spp. causes green or red, elongate to pod-shaped galls on Arctostaphylos leaves. Galled leaves commonly appear to have swollen or rolled leaf edges. Tiny, gray or greenish aphids feed by sucking on tissue within the leaf galls. These aphids feed only on manzanita. Throughout most of the year adult females (which may be winged or wingless) give birth to live young without mating. In the fall, a sexual generation of winged males and females is produced. The winged aphids disperse, mate, and the females lay overwintering eggs on bark at the base of the plant. Eggs hatch in late winter or spring and the emerging aphids walk up to the leaves, settle to feed, and initiate galls. They have several generations per year. The aphid causes pod-shaped, green to reddish galls in manzanita leaves. The damage does not significantly affect plant health, but can be aesthetically objectionable. Manzanita leafgall aphids are prevalent on new growth, such as that stimulated by frequently irrigating and shearing plants. Avoid fertilization and minimize pruning and other cultural practices that stimulate succulent plant growth. Do not irrigate too frequently or with excess amounts. Avoid applying nitrogen fertilizers to established plants. If fertilizing, apply no more than necessary and use slow-release materials to avoid stimulating aphid populations. If these aphids were not tolerable the previous season, horticultural oil can be applied to lower trunk bark when buds begin to swell but before they burst into new leaves. Oil application may be a good choice if plants are also infested by scale insects or other pests overwintering on bark that will also be controlled. Certain systemic insecticides can be effective if applied before leaves become galled, but may kill bees and natural enemies that feed on plant nectar and pollen. Consult the Pest Notes: Aphids for more information.",

        "description": "This eriophyid mite (family Eriophyidae) causes glossy, green, raised blisters or swellings on the upper surface of oak leaves. The swellings may later turn brown. The mite in California infests coast live oak, canyon live oak, huckleberry oak, and interior live oak.",
        "identification": "The mites occur in yellow to orange felty masses (erineum) in depressions on the underside of blistered leaves. They occur mainly in lower, shady portions of the tree canopy. The mites are whitish or yellowish, slender, and wormlike and resemble the eriophyid mites found on citrus buds. Their 2 pairs of legs protrude from the head (wider end) of the mite. Because they are only about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long a hand lens of at least 20\u00d7 or a dissecting binocular microscope is needed to see them. Oak leaf blister fungus (Taphrina coerulescens) causes similar swellings on the upper surface of oak leaves. Its masses of pale spores on leaf surfaces resemble the felty masses caused by erineum mites. However, Taphrina spores can occur on either leaf surface while the felty colonies of erineum mites generally occur only on the underside of oak leaves. Microscopic examination may be required to confidently distinguish between erineum mites and Taphrina spores. One detection method is to place infested plant tissue in a container with 90% ethyl alcohol. Shake this for about 10 seconds so tissue is thoroughly coated and eriophyids are killed and dislodged. At a magnification of at least 20\u00d7 examine the fluid for pale, elongate eriophyids. ",
        "life_cycle": "Eriophyids develop through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The mites overwinter in the erineum pockets on the underside of leaves and may also occur in buds. Mite feeding during spring when new leaves are produced causes the plant to produce the feltlike growths within which the mites feed. Oak leaf erineum mite has multiple generations per year.",
        "damage": "Leaves infested with this erineum mite develop swellings on the upper surface and felty masses containing mites on the under surface. Infested leaves may become curled or otherwise distorted. This damage is harmless to oaks.",
        "solutions": "No control is known or needed for this aesthetic pest. Eriophyids can be difficult to control with pesticides. Where a pesticide will be applied, it may be best to delay application until the next growing season and spray terminals as new growth develops and buds swell. Potentially effective miticides include horticultural oil, neem oil, and wettable sulfur. Do not apply oil within about 3 weeks before or after spraying sulfur and vice versa or plant damage can occur.

        "description": "At least five Parthenolecanium spp. occur in California. These and several similar species of soft scales (Coccidae) were formerly named Lecanium spp., hence their common names. The species are now separated into the genera Eulecanium and Parthenolecanium. Lecanium scale nymphs occur on leaves and twigs and are oval-shaped and orangish to yellow. Mature females have a dark brown, hump-shaped, oval body and sometimes several ridges along the back. Mature females are 1/12 to 2/5 inch in diameter and usually occur on young twigs. On evergreen hosts mature females can occur on both leaves and twigs. Males of most species are uncommon or not known to occur. Male nymphs form elongate, waxy puparia (hardened skins) within which they mature into adults. Adult males have a reddish body, one pair of translucent to whitish wings, and two filaments projecting from their rear end. European fruit lecanium. Parthenolecanium corni is the most common lecanium scale in California. It may be a complex of more than one species. European fruit lecanium feeds on a few evergreen species and many deciduous hosts including alder, cottonwood, coyote brush, elm, fruit and nut trees, poplar, and toyon. Oak lecanium. Parthenolecanium quercifex occurs on oak and other Fagaceae (e.g., chinquapin, Chrysolepis). It is most common on coast live oak. The look-alike European fruit lecanium is generally not found on oak. Frosted scale. Parthenolecanium pruinosum, sometimes called globose scale, is usually a pest only on walnut. Populations that commonly are innocuous occur on many other deciduous trees. Unlike the other lecanium scales, frosted scale females are covered by a white, waxy powder in spring that weathers away by early summer. Lecanium scales develop through three life stages - egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs mature into adults in the spring. Each female then begins laying up to several hundred eggs. Eggs hatch into crawlers (mobile, first instars), which emerge from beneath the female's body during May to July. Nymphs feed mostly on leaves, then in the fall molt into second instars and move to overwinter on twigs. Lecanium scales have one generation per year. Lecanium scales suck phloem sap and excrete copious honeydew, which attracts ants, makes a sticky mess, and promotes the growth of blackish sooty mold. Lecanium scales commonly are not abundant, but feeding by high populations over several years can weaken trees and kill twigs and small branches. Prune out heavily infested branches if few in number. Do not prune woody species so extensively that they are damaged. Conserve natural enemies by controlling ants and dust and avoiding the application of residual (persistent), broad-spectrum insecticides. Many natural enemies help to control lecanium scales. Common predators include lady beetles, such as Hyperaspis spp., Rhyzobius lophanthae, and twicestabbed lady beetle (Chilocorus orbus); brown lacewings and green lacewings; a predaceous sap beetle (Cybocephalus californicus); and predatory seed bugs (Phytocoris spp.). Frequently lecanium scales are heavily parasitized by tiny wasps including Aphytis, Coccophagus, Encarsia, and Metaphycus spp. If warranted, apply horticultural oil during the early dormant season (before mid-January) or delayed-dormant season (as buds begin to swell). Oil sprays are not recommended on plums and walnuts during the dormant season. If treatment of plum or walnut is warranted and soil moisture during the growing season has been adequate for good growth, apply oil precisely timed during the delayed-dormant period, after buds begin to swell but before shoots begin to elongate. Alternatively, wait until leaves completely open and spray the first-instar scales on foliage. If spraying during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers with several traps of double-sided tape wrapped around twigs. Apply oil when monitoring beginning in the spring indicates that most scales are early instars or when crawler abundance declines after it has peaked. If scale-infested trees will be sprayed and are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. See Pest Notes: Scales and The Scale Insects of California: Part 1: The Soft Scales for more information.

        "description": "Leafcutting bees (family Megachilidae) are beneficial pollinators that cut circular pieces from leaves and petals to use as nesting material for their young. At least 75 Megachile species of leafcutting bees occur in California. For example, the introduced alfalfa leafcutting bee, M. rotundata, is of great economic importance because it is the most efficient pollinator of alfalfa. Megachile adults are generally blackish or gray with white or yellowish hairs on the abdomen that form pale bands that separate the segments. Adults can be up 1/2 inch long, but commonly are somewhat smaller than a honey bee. Unlike with honey bees where pollen is carried on hairs on the legs, leafcutting bees carry most pollen on hairs on the underside of the abdomen. See Family Megachilidae - Leafcutter, Mason, and Resin Bees, and Allies from Iowa State University and Leafcutter Bee, Megachile sp. from UC Irvine for photos of adults of various species. The pale eggs, larvae, and pupae and dark cocoons occur hidden in cylindrical cells in tubelike cavities and are not commonly observed. Immatures occur individually in cells that adult females form in holes or hollows where the young are reared. Locations of brood cells include abandoned tunnels of wood-boring insects, stem hollows, and tree holes. The Megachilidae family in California includes at least 9 genera in addition to Megachile. Other genera with the most species are discussed below. All Megachilidae share the traits of carrying pollen on dense hairs (scopae) on the underside of the abdomen and rearing their young in individual chambers formed from plant parts or soil. Hairy belly bees. Ashmeadiella includes 42 California species and Hoplitis includes 70 California species. These bees line and partition their brood cavities with chewed-up leaf pulp and plant resins. Ashmeadiella are chunky, relatively small, and commonly black with pale hairs in bands on the abdomen. Hoplitis includes species that are black, black and red, or green. Many species have pale hairs on the thorax and bands of hairs on the abdomen. Some species have males with distinctive antennae that are swollen at the base and middle and pointed at the tip. Mason bees. Osmia includes 95 California species that line their nest cavities in wood with chewed-up leaf pulp, mud, or sand. These stout-bodied bees are mostly dark metallic blue, but some are bright metallic green. Wool carder bees. Anthidium includes 22 California species that scrape plant hairs from leaf and stem surfaces to line their cavity nests with cottonlike fillings. Their brood chambers are located in hollows in plant stems or wood or holes in the ground. They are stout-bodied, some with black and yellow coloration that mimics yellowjackets; other species are black and white. Males have prominent toothlike projections at the tip of their abdomen. Bees develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Winter is spent as mature larvae (prepupae) in individual cells formed by adult females. In spring to early summer, the bees pupate, emerge as adults, and mate. Adults of most species are active only during spring and early summer. Unlike honey bees that live in a colony of many bees, most bees including leafcutting bees are solitary species. Adult females seek hollows where they create brood cells lined with cut away plant parts or soil. Within the hollow the female provisions a cell with a mixture of nectar and pollen, lays an egg, then seals the egg in the cell with food. Within the same hole or hollow adult females commonly form a series of cells one after the other. After a cell is sealed by the mother bee the larva hatches. Each larva over several weeks consumes the bee food, then spins a dark cocoon within its cell. Most species of leafcutting bees have only one generation per year. Most of the life span is spent within the cell as larvae. Leafcutting bees feed on pollen and nectar and do not otherwise eat plants. Megachile species and many other species of leafcutting bees chew circular to semicircular holes in the margins of blossoms or leaves. This damage can mar plant aesthetics but is harmless to otherwise healthy plants. Bees are important pollinators and should not be killed. Where these bees have preferred small plants for collecting material, covering them with cheesecloth or other screening prevents further damage. Place out these barriers when leaf cutting is first observed. Barriers can be removed about midsummer when the adults are no longer active. Reducing nesting sites may locally reduce the number of leafcutting bees. For example, fill holes that are 1/8 to 7/8 inch in diameter. Seal the ends of pruned rose canes with wax or a couple drops of white glue.

        "description": "This sucking insect (Kuwaniidae) feeds on the bark of blue oak, Quercus douglasii. Obvious roughening and exfoliation (flaking off) of bark are the apparent symptoms of infestation. Pieces of bark that have flaked off may cover the ground near the trunk. Gray or whitish wax that surrounds the preadult females can be seen under loose bark in the spring. Adults and older nymphs are red, roundish, about 1/10 inch in diameter, and covered with gray or white wax. The scales occur mostly hidden under bark plates and in crevices on blue oak limbs and trunks. Kuwana oak scale closely resembles the oak xylococcus scale, Xylococculus quercus, and Ehrhorn's oak scale, Mycetococcus ehrhorni. Both scales occur on the bark of various species of oaks, but neither causes obvious bark roughening or exfoliation. The life cycle of this insect in California is mostly unknown. Preadult females are present in late winter. Mature females produce crawlers beginning in spring. Scale feeding on blue oak causes extensive roughening and flaking off of the bark, exposing tissue underneath that is discolored and blackish. Other than the obvious bark roughening and flaking, whether the scale has long-term impacts on tree health is unknown. Nothing is known about managing this species of scale or whether management efforts are warranted to protect the health of blue oaks. Conserving natural enemies and applying horticultural oil or certain other insecticides are primary tactics for managing most scales.

        "description": "This sucking insect (Coccidae) sometimes damages plum and other Prunus spp., mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento Valley. Kuno scale females are about 1/6 inch in diameter and almost spherical, resembling beads on stems. Mature females are dark and shiny brown. Females are yellow and orangish with black bands and blotches during a short period prior to egg production in late spring. Unlike other species of soft scales it resembles, Kuno scales have a broad, internal 'lip' or shelf-like margin where the adult female attaches to the host; this lip is best seen by removing females from the host and examining their underside. The nymphs are yellow or brown and flattened and during summer occur mostly along veins on the underside of leaves. The elongate, translucent, male cocoons are 1/12 inch long and can be prevalent on twigs. Nymphs overwinter on twigs and mature into adults during March through early May. Eggs produced beneath the female hatch during spring into crawlers (mobile, first-instar nymphs) that migrate to settle and feed on leaves during summer. Nymphs return to the twigs before leaf drop in the fall. Kuno scale has one generation per year. Kuno scales suck phloem sap from leaves and twigs. The scale is most abundant on plum trees in gardens and landscapes; it is not a pest on commercial fruit and nut crops in California. Rarely damaged hosts include cotoneaster, pyracantha, rose, walnut, and other woody Rosaceae. Kuno scales can become abundant quickly. They produce copious amounts of honeydew, which results in blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants. Feeding by high populations of scale causes hosts to appear water stressed. Prolonged high scale populations can result in premature leaf drop and dieback of twigs. Control ants, which attack the natural enemies of scale insects. If the scale has been abundant, spray horticultural oil on branch terminals and twigs during the delayed dormant period (as buds begin to swell) or thoroughly drench the underside of leaves in early summer. Avoid spraying dormant plum and walnut trees with oil. Do not apply oil when temperatures will exceed 90\u00b0F or if trees have suffered from a lack of adequate soil moisture.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/klamath.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "The Klamathweed beetle, a type of leaf beetle in the family Chrysomelidae, was deliberately introduced into California during the 1940s to control common St. Johnswort, Hypericum perforatum. Also called Klamathweed, this inadvertently introduced rangeland weed is toxic to cattle and sheep. The beetle largely eliminated Klamathweed from several hundred thousand acres in California. Each year this saves ranchers millions of dollars in otherwise lost grazing land and poisoned livestock. Subsequently, other Hypericum species became popular ground covers and shrubs in California landscapes. These, especially creeping St. Johnswort, H. calycinum, are also fed upon by this leaf beetle. Adults are oblong and about 1/4 inch long with a downward-pointed head. They are metallic shiny and colored blue, bronze, green, or purple. Eggs are oblong and about 1/25 inch long. Larvae are plump and somewhat humpbacked. They are gray, orangish, or pinkish and grow up to 1/4 inch long. Klamathweed beetle develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Each adult female can lay about 1,000 eggs during her life span of several months. Eggs are laid from fall through winter singly or in clusters on leaves. The beetle overwinters primarily as eggs or larvae. After hatching, larvae feed during late fall through winter and develop through three, increasingly larger instars. Mature larvae (prepupae) enter soil to a depth of about 1 inch during late winter and form a cell in which to pupate. Adults emerge primarily in April and May, mate, and mostly feed during spring and early summer. During hot, dry summer weather adults aestivate (are inactive and do not feed). Adults again become active in fall, feeding and laying eggs. Adults and larvae chew and feed on various Hypericum species. Larvae feed on lower leaves and the base of stems during fall through winter. Adults feed higher on plants, and their chewing damage occurs primarily during spring and early summer when hosts produce most of their growth flush and flowering. After being inactive during summer, adults feed to a lesser extent again during the fall. When Klamathweed beetle is abundant, ornamental species of Hypericum, especially creeping St. Johnswort, can be heavily defoliated. Plants in irrigated landscapes generally recover and the chewing damage is primarily aesthetic. Provide regular, deep irrigation for hosts during the drought season, especially when temperatures are hot. Protect plants from injury, such as by avoiding compaction or other soil disturbances around roots. Vigorous host plants tolerate moderate leaf beetle feeding, and control is generally not warranted to protect plant health. Removing litter accumulated beneath plants in hot areas may reduce the survival of adult beetles that rest there during the summer. Keeping soil beneath plants moist during the spring may increase disease and mortality of immature beetles that pupate then near the soil surface. Applying parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) to soil beneath plants may provide control if applications are made during late winter, shortly before larvae pupate. Monitor the lowest parts of host plants for larvae to determine when to apply nematodes; pupation occurs after mature larvae are observed on foliage near the ground. If chewing damage has not been tolerable, foliar or systemic insecticides can provide control. Because foliar sprays should target young larvae, monitor basal stems and lower leaves for larvae regularly in fall and early winter if you are considering spraying insecticide. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. galleriae (e.g., BeetleGONE!) selectively kills leaf beetle adults and larvae that consume sprayed foliage. Because of its short persistence, when young larvae are present make 2 applications about 10 days apart, thoroughly spraying the lower foliage. Other foliar sprays for leaf beetles include azadirachtin and spinosad. Avoid foliar application of carbamates (e.g., carbaryl), organophosphates (acephate, malathion), and pyrethroids (permethrin and other \"-thrin\" insecticides) because of their negative impact on bees and natural enemies and potential for drift and movement to contaminate surface waters. Translocated (systemic) neonicotinoids (e.g., imidacloprid) can be sprayed on foliage or drenched (watered) or injected into soil during fall or spring to provide season-long control.

        "description": "Larvae of this moth (Cosmopterigidae) are a pest of juniper in the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, and warm interior valleys.",
        "identification": "Twig girdler damage resembles the foliage browning and dieback of juniper from causes including cypress canker, cypress leaftier and cypress webber, cypress tipminer, minute cypress scale, and root and crown rot diseases. To help distinguish the cause of damage, examine plants closely for insects and the silk webbing produced by certain caterpillars. Look for discolored bark and cambium caused by cypress canker and darkened, soft roots caused by root decay pathogens. Dying branches caused by mice have bark chewed away in bands from lower parts of branches. Twig dieback at the edges of plantings may be the result of dog urine, which sometimes can be diagnosed by the characteristic odor. To confirm twig girdler as the cause of damage, peel bark from the branch where dead and living tissue meet. Inspect the wood for girdling tunnels containing insect excrement and one or more cream-colored, pink, or yellowish larvae up to 1/4 inch long with a brown head. Shiny, black to brown pupae about 1/5 inch long may also be found in tunnels. The twig girdler adult (moth) is about 1/4 inch long and shiny with mostly dark brown to blackish forewings. Adults are not often observed, but may be seen taking flight if damaged branches are shaken during late winter through early summer.",
        "life_cycle": "Adults are present primarily from May through June in the San Francisco Bay Area and March through May in Southern California. The females lay tiny eggs on woody stems. The hatching larvae tunnel in and feed for about 9 months from spring through winter. There is one generation per year.",
        "damage": "Tunneling by juniper twig girdler causes foliage on small limbs to turn yellow, then brown and die. This results in clumps of brown limbs among green foliage by late summer. Twig girdler feeding makes junipers unsightly, but does not kill entire plants in the landscape. Junipers specially cultivated in containers to remain small (bonsai) may be severely damaged.",
        "solutions": "Prune out and dispose of affected branches to improve plant appearance if their abundance is limited to small portions of the plant. Avoid planting Tam juniper (Juniperus sabina \u2018Tamariscifolia\u2019), which is very susceptible to twig girdler. Instead of Tam juniper or Hollywood juniper (J. torulosa or J. chinensis \u2018Kaizuka\u2019 or \u2018Torulosa\u2019), consider planting cultivars that are less susceptible to the juniper twig girdler. Effective control with a contact insecticide is difficult. Larvae boring under bark are generally not susceptible to insecticide. Applying insecticide does not restore the appearance of damaged foliage, which remains brown until new growth occurs. If damage cannot be tolerated, it can possibly be prevented by spraying foliage thoroughly about twice with a broad-spectrum, residual, contact insecticide such as permethrin or other pyrethroid to kill adult moths and prevent them from laying eggs. To help time applications, regularly shake branches of infested hosts from late winter through early summer to observe when the shiny moths take flight and are abundant. Generally, in Southern California spray in late March and early May and in Northern California spray in early May and late June. Be aware that urban uses of pyrethroids and certain other insecticides are contaminating storm drains and household drains; this causes pyrethroids to pollute surface waters at levels hazardous to aquatic life. Consider tolerating twig girdler damage in landscapes instead of applying insecticide.

        "life_cycle": "Adults emerge from overwintering pupae in soil and most egg laying occurs during spring. By midsummer egg laying ceases, and plants often continue to produce new leaves that do not develop galls. Larvae require succulent new terminals in order to feed and cause galls. Pupation of the spring and summer generations occurs within the galls. In the fall, mature larvae drop from galls or crawl to pupate under the tree canopy, within 1 inch of the soil surface. There are about six overlapping generations per year in California.",
        "damage": "Infested leaflets form brown, green, or reddish galls. Heavily infested foliage turns brown and drops prematurely, leaving parts of branches leafless. ",
        "solutions": "Avoid the Sunburst honey locust, which has bright yellow spring foliage. Sunburst readily defoliates in response to drought or temperature changes, as well as gall midge damage. Consider planting the Shademaster cultivar of honey locust, which appears to be less susceptible. Black locust, Robinia spp., are not infested by this midge. Several species of parasitic and predaceous wasps feed on this pest. Because the gall midge has many generations and the larvae and pupae occur protected in galls or soil, this insect is not easily controlled with insecticides. On small plants, narrow-range oil, or horticultural oil, sprayed to thoroughly cover terminals at intervals during about March and April kills gall midge eggs and can substantially reduce damage. To increase the effectiveness of oil, properly time its application. Beginning in early March, monitor for the presence of adults by hanging at least two yellow sticky traps in the lower outer branches of honeylocust. Inspect each trap at least twice a week using a 10X hand lens or a dissecting microscope to view and identify the adults, described above.",

        "description": "This sucking insect (Xylococcidae) causes foliage discoloring and dieback on incense cedar, Monterey cypress, and various Cupressus and Juniperus spp., especially on young plants growing at shaded locations. It usually is common only in stands of native conifers, not in urban areas.",
        "identification": "This scale is easily overlooked and often will be found only by peeling back layers of loose bark. Nymphs and females are oblong, dark reddish to brown, and wingless. Mature females are about 1/4 inch long. The tiny, winged adult males are easily overlooked; they are 1/8 inch long and have legs and long, thin antennae. The incense cedar scale preadult female (cyst, or resting stage) is 1/8 inch long and closely resembles the cypress bark mealybug. Both species can occur on the same hosts. Incense cedar scale and cypress bark mealybug do not resemble the minute cypress scale. All three of these species are sometimes called cypress scale, but they are in separate insect families and have different biology.",
        "life_cycle": "Adult females lay eggs on the foliage in spring. Eggs hatch into mobile first instars (crawlers) that settle to feed on branch and trunk bark and molt to legless stages in the summer. In addition to the egg, there are four female stages and five male stages. Females overwinter as legless second and third instars (stages), and males as legless second instars and legged prepupae on bark. In early spring, females molt into legged adults and moved to foliage; the males occur on bark and pupate into winged adults. The scale has one generation per year.",
        "damage": "Scale infestation is indicated by the blackish appearance of the trunk and larger branches caused by sooty mold. Bark may also exhibit mealy, white wax produced by the scales.",
        "solutions": "Conserving natural enemies and applying horticultural oil or certain other insecticides are primary tactics for managing scales. For additional information, consult the Pest Notes: Scales.",

        "description": "The pest, also named Asian woolly hackberry aphid (Aphididae), sucks phloem sap from Celtis spp. leaves. It is especially abundant on Chinese hackberry, Celtis sinensis. Check for the insects to confirm that the cause of honeydew is aphids. These aphids on green shoots and leaves occur beneath small, roundish, fuzzy, bluish or white waxy masses, each 1/10 inch in diameter or less. Their body is gray to whitish. Winged adults have distinct black borders along the forewing veins and their antennae have alternating dark and light bands. Citricola scale, Coccus pseudomagnoliarum, is the only other honeydew-producing insect that infests hackberry at annoying levels in California. It is most common in the Central Valley on citrus and hackberry. The scales are immobile most of their life and are easily overlooked. On leaves, the first-instar scales are often translucent and barely visible with the naked eye. Older scales occur on twigs where their mottled gray to brown color blends in with bark. The aphid overwinters on terminals as eggs that hatch in spring when the new leaves flush. Adults and nymphs can be abundant on leaves from spring through fall. Throughout most of the growing season, adult females (which may be winged or wingless) give birth to live young without mating. In the fall, a sexual generation of winged males and females is produced. The aphids mate and females lay the overwintering eggs on bud scales. The aphid has multiple generations per year. The aphid sucks phloem sap and produces copious honeydew and wax on hackberry leaves. The honeydew and wax excreted by adults and nymphs typically become most abundant and bothersome during late summer. Insecticides apparently are not warranted to protect the health or survival of aphid-infested hackberries. If the excretions are intolerable, foliage can be sprayed with horticultural oil. Alternatively, hackberry branch terminals can be sprayed with oil after leaves drop, during the dormant season or delayed-dormant season, to kill the overwintering eggs. On large trees, the most practical control is to apply systemic insecticide according to label directions, preferably as a soil application or bark spray during late winter or spring. Avoid injecting or implanting pesticides or other materials into hackberry trunks or roots. Chinese hackberry are susceptible to an unexplained, tree-killing malady; the cause may be a vascular wilt pathogen mechanically spread by unsterilized tools that contact internal parts of multiple hackberry trees, such as tools used to prune trees or inject them with chemicals. See Pest Notes: Hackberry Woolly Aphid for more information.",

        "description": "This soft scale (family Coccidae) infests mostly broadleaves of subtropical and tropical origin. Hosts include anthurium, aralia, begonia, camellia, croton, ficus, hibiscus, gardenia, pittosporum, plumeria, Schefflera, Schinus, and Syzygium. The scale is ovoid and brown, green, or yellowish. The body of mature females is slightly convex and 1/8 to 1/6 inch long. The adult female secretes a wide, cottony egg sac beneath her body that erupts around the margins. This differs from most soft scale species in California, where eggs remain hidden underneath the females' body. Males are not known in this species. Green shield scale develops through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. After hatching from an egg, nymphs remain relatively mobile and can move to infest and feed on different portions of the plant or adjoining plants that are touching. There is one generation per year. Green shield scale sucks phloem sap from leaves and thin-barked shoots. When abundant it produces copious honeydew on which blackish sooty mold grows. Mature females cover plants with flocculent white egg sacs. Long after the scales have died; this white wax can remain on plant surfaces, reducing plant aesthetic quality. The mealybug destroyer is an important predator of green shield scale. Parasitic wasps also help control this pest if natural enemies are conserved (preserved). To increase the effectiveness of natural enemies, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. When direct control is warranted after employing natural enemy conservation practices, infested terminals can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring. See Pest Notes: Scales for more management recommendations, including the section \"Monitoring\" that discusses how to effectively time oil application.

        "description": "These look-alike, armored scale insects (family Diaspididae) can infest numerous plant species. Although sometimes abundant and unsightly, these scales rarely, if ever, cause significant damage to plants; an exception is kiwifruit. Greedy scale and latania scale can occur on leaves, stems, and fruit of numerous plant species. Mature females and nymphs are circular, convex, and gray, tan, or white. Distinct concentric rings commonly form on the cover as the scales grow. Mature females are 1/25 to 1/12 inch in diameter. In California, male greedy scales are not known and male latania scales are rarely seen; reproduction is mostly or entirely parthenogenetic. Greedy scale and latania scale cannot be distinguished in the field. Discriminating them requires expert examination of microscopic characters. These species resemble oleander scale, which may be the most common scale in California. However, the cover of greedy and latania scale females is more globular or raised than the flattened cover of oleander scale. The small, raised, somewhat darker area (exuvia, covering of earlier nymphal stage) of greedy and latania scales is to one side of the cover; the exuvia of oleander scale is near its center. The many hosts of greedy scale include acacia, bay, boxwood, ceanothus, fruit trees, holly, ivy, laurel, magnolia, manzanita, palm, pepper tree, pittosporum, pyracantha, redbud, strawberry tree, and willow. Latania scale has a similarly broad host list but prefers broadleaved evergreens and in California may be more common than greedy scale. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of the hosts of greedy scale and latania scale and references for more information. Armored scales develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The scales overwinter as mature females, which begin producing crawlers (mobile first instars) in late winter. Female nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages before maturing into adults. There are two or more generations per year. These scales suck and feed on fruit, leaves, and stems of numerous plant species. When abundant they give hosts a crusty appearance, reducing plants' aesthetic quality. However, even when abundant they have no apparent adverse effect on plant health, except for kiwifruit. Several parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on these scales as listed for greedy scale and latania scale at ScaleNet. Predators include the black lady beetle (Rhyzobius lophanthae) brown lacewings, green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and twice-stabbed lady beetle. To conserve (preserve) natural enemies and improve biological control, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Where the presence of these scales is intolerable, horticultural oil provides control if infested foliage and shoots are thoroughly sprayed when crawlers are active in late winter or spring. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time applications by monitoring scale crawlers using sticky tape traps.

        "description": "Dead, dying, and severely stressed California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera) and date palm (Phoenix dactylifera) can become infested with giant palm borer. This beetle is a secondary pest and not the original cause of unhealthy palms. Adults are blackish to dark reddish-brown beetles (family Bostrichidae) up to 2 inches long. Like other bostrichids the head points sharply downward and the mouthparts are not visible from above. From above the head appears bulbous. Eggs are oval, white to yellowish, and about 1/16 inch long. They occur in a chamber in wood chewed by the female, commonly just below the leaf crown. Larvae are stout, yellowish, and occur hidden in trunks. They can grow up to 2-1/2 inches long and have a C-shaped posture when disturbed or exposed. Pupae occur in a chamber in wood within about 1 inch of the surface of trunks. The adult female chews an entrance tunnel and excavates a chamber beneath the leaf crown of hosts. Males are attracted to enter the tunnel and mate. The adult female then lays up to about 500 eggs. The emerging larvae each bore a tunnel and feed for several years on the inner stem of host palms. The larval stage lasts from about 3 to 9 years if infested plants survive that long. Mature larvae pupate just under the surface of the trunk in about April and May. Adults emerge about two months later, leaving holes in trunks about 1/2 inch in diameter. Adults fly mostly during summer and infest other hosts or reinfest the palm where they fed as larvae. At least several years are required to complete one generation. Generations overlap, and all life stages can be found in a host during much of the year. Giant palm borer can infest California fan palm and date palm. Adults and larvae chew, feed, and tunnel in the main stem (trunk) and base of the leaf crown. At the base of the leaf crown females excavate a chamber that becomes partly filled with soft, thick, moist material composed of chewed fibers, excrement, and sap. Larvae form tunnels in wood that can occur up and down the length of trunks. Emerging adults leave holes in trunks. Fronds of infested palms turn yellow and the plants commonly die prematurely. Weakened palms may fall over in the wind. Giant palm borer is a secondary pest. It attacks hosts that are dead, dying, or severely stressed, such as from transplanting. Provide palms with good growing conditions and proper cultural care to keep them healthy. Dispose of dead and dying palms, in which the beetles breed. No control other than good preventive care of palms is known.

A dissecting binocular microscope or similar magnifier is needed to clearly see them. Generally it is their damage as described below that is the obvious clue to the presence of eriophyids. Adult and immature eriophyids have four legs. The legs appear to be coming out of the head, which is at the wide end of the body. The body is carrot shaped or wormlike and commonly pinkish, yellow, or whitish. The tiny, pale eggs are hemispherical. One detection method is to place infested plant tissue in a container with 90% ethyl alcohol. Shake this for about 10 seconds so tissue is thoroughly coated, and eriophyids are killed and dislodged. At a magnification of at least 20\u00d7, examine the fluid for pale, elongate eriophyids.",
        "life_cycle": "Eriophyids develop through 4 life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. Adult females lay about 50 eggs during their life span. As temperatures cool in the fall and host leaves drop or the plant becomes dormant, eriophyids move to bark crevices and buds to overwinter. When host buds begin to develop and swell in late winter and spring, eriophyids begin feeding and reproducing. Egg to adult development occurs in about 10 to 14 days when temperatures are warm. Eriophyids have multiple generations per year.",
        "damage": "Eriophyids commonly blister, discolor, or distort flowers, leaves, or shoots. Although this damage mars plant appearance and may reduce yield on fruiting hosts, most eriophyids do not seriously threaten the health of garden and landscape plants and can be tolerated. Hosts of eriophyids include aloe, bermudagrass, caneberries, citrus, cottonwood, fuchsia, garlic, grape, linden, nectarine, maple, oak, olive, onion, peach, pear, persimmon, plum, poplar, privet, tomato, walnut, and willow. Eriophyids are named for a primary type of damage they cause, such as blister mites, bud mites, gall mites, and rust mites. For example, fuchsia gall mite (Aculops fuchsiae) distorts fuchsia blossoms. The cottonwood gall mite (Eriophyes parapopuli) causes dark, warty, woody swellings on twigs near the buds of cottonwoods and poplars. Feeding by erineum mites, such as live oak erineum mite (Eriophyes mackiei), causes pale, felty, or hairy patches of distorted leaf growth called erineum.",
        "solutions": "No controls are recommended for most eriophyid mites. Naturally occurring predators are believed to sometimes be important in their management. To allow natural enemies to be more effective, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose-off small plants), and avoid the application of miticides and broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Eriophyids can be difficult to control with pesticides. They are commonly protected from sprays by their feeding location enclosed in buds and distorted tissue. By the time tissue grows and damage becomes apparent, the mites may no longer be abundant or present. Where pesticide will be applied, it may be best to delay application until the next growing season and spray terminals as new growth develops, when buds swell before they open. Potentially effective miticides available to home gardeners include horticultural oil, neem oil, and wettable sulfur. Do not apply oil within about 3 weeks of spraying sulfur or plant damage can occur.

        "description": "Several Pemphigus and Thecabius spp. aphids (Aphididae) cause galls on cottonwood and poplar leaves. Their alternate hosts include lettuce, related weeds, and various Brassicaceae. The lettuce root aphid, Pemphigus bursarius, commonly galls Lombardy poplar leaves during the spring. It also feeds on lettuce roots in clustered colonies covered with white powdery wax. Lettuce root aphid and other Pemphigus and Thecabius spp. that infest cottonwood and poplar can be distinguished from most other aphid species by their short antennae (less than one-third body length) and the absence of obvious cornicles (tailpipelike tubes on top their rear). Their body is gray, pale green, yellow, or white, varying by the age and species of aphid and the host plant. Aphid feeding on leaves or leaf petioles stimulates plant tissue to form a hollow gall around the aphid. The enclosed aphid gives birth to nymphs, many of which develop wings and emerge and migrate to feed on the same plant or alternate hosts, depending on the aphid species and time of year. The lettuce root aphid migrates from poplar leaves to feed on the basal stem and roots of lettuce and other alternate hosts, then in the fall flies back to poplars where females lay overwintering eggs. Poplar gall aphids cause relatively harmless galls on cottonwood and poplar leaves. On their alternate host lettuce, plants heavily attacked by P. bursarius may wilt during the day. Developing lettuce heads remain soft and fail to develop properly and yields are reduced. Extremely heavy aphid populations over a prolonged period can cause collapse and death of lettuce. vegetable crop hosts",

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/fuchsiagallmite.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Feeding by this mite (family Eriophyidae) causes fuchsia leaves and shoots to distort, thicken, and form irregular galls. Because of their microscopic size their characteristic plant damage as described below is used to identify the problem as feeding by fuchsia gall mite. Aculops fuchsiae is the only eriophyid species known to infest Fuchsia species at damaging levels. The mites are pale yellowish, carrot shaped or wormlike, and 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) or less in length. They have two pairs of thin legs protruding from their head (wider) end. They resemble other Aculops species of the same coloration. Except for when the mites are found in abundance on fuchsia, they can be discriminated to species only by expert preparation and examination of microscopic characters. Eriophyids develop through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The protonymph and deutonymph are sometimes respectively called larva and nymph. The mites live and reproduce within the folds of galled tissue and among plant hairs. As infested plants grow, some mites leave the galls and move upward to attack new terminal growth and blossoms. The mites occur on growing tips year-round and in flowers whenever present. The mite prefers cool growing conditions and its abundance and reproduction are reduced by warm temperatures. Each adult female lays a total of about 50 eggs, which hatch in about 1 week. Nymphs feed for about 2 weeks before maturing into adults. The life cycle from egg to reproductive adult is completed in about 3 weeks. There are several generations per year. Fuchsia gall mite feeding distorts and thickens leaves and terminals and causes infested foliage to redden. Flower production is reduced and when the mites are abundant, over time they can stop all new growth. Because fuchsias and the mite develop best where summers are cool, fuchsia gall mite is mostly a problem in Coastal California and interiorscapes. Predatory mites especially Neoseiulus (=Amblyseius) californicus significantly suppress the mite's abundance where miticides and broad-spectrum insecticides are not applied. However, biological control is generally not satisfactory on fuchsia cultivars most susceptible to this pest. To reduce damage, grow only resistant fuchsias and consider replacing susceptible species. To manage the mite Do not exchange fuchsia plant material with others and obtain plants only from a quality, commercial supplier. Keep infested plants in a cool windless place and isolate them from other fuchsias if possible because the mites can spread with the wind as well as on infested clothing, hands, plants, and tools. Practice excellent hygiene: change clothing, clean shoes, wash hands, and clean tools with alcohol after contact with infested plants. Pinch off or prune and remove all infested parts of the plants and destroy or dispose of them away from plants. Do not compost fuchsia plant parts. Spray the remaining plant parts with a miticide (acaricide) labeled for the plant or site of application. Try to keep hardy fuchsia varieties outside during colder weather, which may help to kill off the mites. If pesticide will be applied, first prune or pinch off and destroy all infested (damaged) leaves and terminals. Then apply horticultural (narrow-range) oil or insecticidal soap at internals, such as 2 to 3 weeks apart. Certain effective miticides such as carbaryl are only available to professional applicators and can only be applied outdoors. Take indoor plants outdoors and after the application do not bring plants back inside until the spray has completely dried. Be aware that carbaryl is highly toxic to bees and natural enemies. Consider covering outdoor plants with cheese cloth or other screening after the application to exclude bees and hummingbirds on which the mites can hitchhike. Consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company for help in how to select a company and discuss their IPM plan. For example, discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your mite problem.

        "description": "This flatheaded borer (family Buprestidae) attacks only alders, especially white alder (Alnus rhombifolia) that is drought stressed. Plant damage as described below is generally the first clue of an infestation of flatheaded alder borer. The elongate adult is dark, shiny, metallic blue or green and 1/4 to 3/8 inch long. It is widest in the middle of the abdomen and tapers toward the rear. The whitish egg is oval to round and flattened. Larvae and pupae occur hidden under bark. The slender larvae are pale yellow to whitish with brown mouthparts and swollen immediately behind the head. Mature larvae are 4/5 to 1 inch long. The oblong pupae are initially pale then darken as they age. Adults emerge from infested alders in late March through May. They chew and feed on the outer edges of alder foliage, although this slight damage is usually not apparent. Each adult lives for about 2 weeks. After mating each adult female lays about 3 to 10 eggs in a mass on the lower trunk or main branches of alders, especially on stressed or declining trees. Eggs hatch in 1 to 2 weeks and the larvae bore into the bark. Larvae chew and feed to form winding tunnels in cambium. In chambers just beneath bark mature larvae (prepupae) overwinter then pupate in spring. There is 1 generation per year. Larval chewing damages alder's vascular system. Noticeable from a distance is foliage yellowing and wilting and dieback of infested branches. Wet spots, dark staining, and gnarled, ridged or swollen growth appear on bark where larvae feed underneath. After larvae complete feeding, they pupate under bark. Each emerging adult leaves a round to D-shaped hole in bark about 1/8 inch in diameter. Infested limbs commonly die and entire trees can be killed by flatheaded alder borer. Provide proper cultural care and protect trees from injury. Providing alders with adequate irrigation throughout their lives is especially important where summer drought prevails. White alders are native to sites near year-round surface water and can become highly drought stressed when planted in landscapes. Consider replacing problem-prone trees. If an alder is preferred, plant more borer-resistant species, such as black alder (e.g., Alnus glutinosa). See the Solutions section of the similar Pacific flatheaded borer for detailed preventive and management recommendations. During late summer or fall, prune out and dispose of all branches showing bleeding, dieback, swelling, or other evidence of infestation by borer larvae. Avoid pruning white alder anytime between March and the end of May because egg laying adult beetles are attracted then to recent pruning wounds. If insecticide will be applied to reduce future infestations, beginning late March inspect leaves for adult chewing feeding. Look for adult beetles during mid to late afternoon by examining foliage and beating or shaking branches over a light-colored surface onto which insects will drop. If adults are known to be present, foliage and wood can be thoroughly sprayed with a residual insecticide (e.g., carbaryl or a pyrethroid) during about mid-April. Insecticide products available to homeowners are not effective and a professional applicator with access to effective products is needed to make the application. Consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company for guidance when selecting a company for hire. Do not substitute insecticide applications for providing proper growing conditions and good cultural care or sprayed trees are likely to die from the conditions that caused them to become unhealthy and attractive to borers.

        "description": "Oak acorns are commonly infested with larvae of filbert weevils (beetles such as Curculio aurivestis, C. occidentis, C. pardus) or the filbertworm (the moth Cydia latiferreana =Melissopus latiferreanus, Tortricidae). Less commonly in California, acorns are infested by the acorn moth [Blastobasis (=Valentinia) glandulella, Blastobasidae]. Larvae of some of these insects can also infest chestnut, hazelnut (filbert), other nut trees, and tanoak. Filbertworm is also an occasional pest of pomegranate. Compared to the slow-moving larvae of the filbert weevils, larvae of acorn moth and filbertworm are generally active when removed from an acorn. Larvae of acorn moth and filbertworm have three pairs of short legs; filbert weevil larvae have no apparent legs. Nuts infested with larvae of acorn moths or filbertworms can contain fine, silken threads, and filbertworm larvae commonly drop on a silken strand when disturbed; filbert weevils do not produce silk. Filbert weevils. Adults are brown to orangish snout beetles (Curculionidae) with long, curved, thin mouthparts. The body of filbert weevil adults is about 1/4 inch long. Curculio species larvae are legless with a brown head and a cream-colored or whitish body. Larvae grow up to 1/3 inch long and commonly curl into a C-shape when disturbed or exposed. Filbertworm. Adults (moths) have brown or copper-colored forewings with markings of black, gray, or both. A thin, brown, lengthwise band occurs along the top of forewings in some individuals. The moth's wingspan is about 3/4 inch. Eggs of filbertworm are scalelike, flattened, and oval. They occur on nuts and resemble eggs of codling moth. Eggs are white when newly laid, then darken as hatching approaches. Larvae grow to 1/2 inch long. They have a dark brown to black head and beige to pink body. Filbertworm pupae occur in a silken cocoon in litter and topsoil. Filbert weevils. Adult females chew a small hole in the seed coat of acorns or other nuts on the tree and insert one or more eggs during summer and fall. Hatching larvae tunnel and feed on the nutmeat. Heavily damaged nuts may drop prematurely during summer. Larvae mature in fall to early winter. Mature larvae (prepupae) chew an exit hole about 1/16 inch in diameter and enter topsoil to overwinter. Pupation occurs in spring or early summer, then adults emerge. Filbert weevils have one generation per year. Filbertworm. The adult female oviposits on nuts. Eggs are laid singly and hatch in about 8 to 11 days. The emerging larva chews inside and develops through several increasingly larger instars. After acorns drop, larvae chew an exit hole and move into organic litter or topsoil where they overwinter as prepupae. Filbertworms pupate in a silken cocoon in spring and emerge as adults in late spring or early summer. In California there is one or (in warmer locations) two generations per year. Second-generation adults, if any, appear in the fall. Although harmless to tree health, larval feeding causes acorns to fail to sprout. Insect-damaged acorns can also become colonized by bacteria that cause annoying, sticky liquid to drip from oaks (drippy acorn, or drippy oak disease). When hazelnut, other nut trees, or (by filbertworm) pomegranate are infested, the nuts or fruit become inedible. No methods have been demonstrated as effective for controlling these insects in gardens and landscapes. Insect abundance and the proportion of infested acorns or fruit vary greatly by host species, location, and year. Collect and dispose of dropped fruit and nuts in covered containers to potentially reduce the abundance of these insects' next generation. When collecting acorns for planting, inspect them and dispose of those that deform easily when squeezed, feel unusually light-weight, or have holes; generally these are not viable. Another method is to place acorns in a tub of water and discard those that float; larval feeding creates air pockets that cause infested acorns to float. Where filbertworm infests pomegranate, you can place out a sticky trap baited with the filbertworm commercial pheromone (sex attractant) to monitor adults. When filbertworm moths are caught in abundance, Bacillus thuringiensis or spinosad can be sprayed. Bacillus thuringiensis must be applied when larvae are small and weather is expected to be dry and warm for several days. A second or third treatment at 7 to 10 day intervals may be warranted because of its short persistence. Spinosad is highly toxic to bees and certain natural enemies; do not apply it to plants that are flowering.

        "description": "These thrips (family Phlaeothripidae) suck and feed on foliage of Ficus species and cause infested leaves to discolor and distort.",
        "identification": "These Gynaikothrips species cause loose curling or folding of ficus leaves and discoloration of the galled foliage. Cuban laurel thrips mostly galls Indian laurel fig, Ficus microcarpa. Weeping laurel thrips mostly galls weeping fig, Ficus benjamina. Adults, eggs, and larvae (or nymphs) of these Gynaikothrips closely resemble each other. They are distinguishable only by an expert examination of microscopic hairs (pronotal posteroangular setae), which in comparison with G. ficorum are longer on G. uzeli. Gynaikothrips adults are 1/10 to 1/8 inch long and black to dark brown. Characteristic of thrips, the adults are narrow and have long fringes of tiny hairs (setae) along the margins of their wings. The tiny eggs occur on foliage within galls. Eggs are beige to translucent white, cylindrical, and smooth and have rounded ends. The first instar (larva) is translucent white and about 1/25 inch long. The second instar is pale yellow and about the length of adults. Second instars commonly hold the rear end pointing up. First and second instars have red eyes. The prepupa (propupa) and pupa do not feed and are relatively inactive. Prepupae develop wing buds (pads) that are externally visible and have antennae that point forward. The pupa has longer wing buds and antennae that are folded back over the head. Several other insects also gall ficus. These inadvertently introduced pests and their host plants are native to Southeast Asia. Ficus gall wasp. Josephiella microcarpae infests only Indian laurel fig and causes leaves to curl or distort. The leaf deformation from feeding of each wasp larva is distinctly rounded and spherical, unlike the leaf curling or folding caused by Gynaikothrips. Leaves galled by the wasp remain uniformly green, unlike with the Gynaikothrips that cause brown, reddish, or purple scars on galled leaves. Ficus eye-spot midge. Horidiplosis ficifolii causes elliptical to irregularly shaped blisters or swellings in leaves of Indian laurel fig. Each swelling is up to about 1/5 inch long and caused by a gall midge (fly) larva feeding inside leaf tissue. The swellings later turn brown and sunken with a tiny hole where the mature larva emerged to pupate. Weeping fig is not infested by this gall midge even when growing near heavily infested Indian laurel fig. Ficus leaf-rolling psyllid. Trioza brevigenae is an aphidlike insect that causes Indian laurel fig leaves to become tightly rolled lengthwise into narrow cylinders about 1/6 inch in diameter. These pencil-like cylinders can harbor various nymphal stages of the psyllid. Infested leaves become dry and brittle but remain uniformly green. Feeding by abundant psyllids can cause premature leaf drop and result in a sparse canopy.",
        "life_cycle": "Thrips hatch from an egg that adult females deposit inside galled (rolled) leaves. They develop through two larval stages that feed, then a prepupal and pupal stage that do not feed before becoming an adult. After hatching the larvae remain feeding inside the gall. All thrips stages occur year-round in galled leaf terminals. Mating, egg laying, and a complete generation develop within a single gall. Gynaikothrips are most abundant from about October through December. Newly galled foliage is formed from midsummer through fall. Only the adults occur outside of galls. Adults are active flyers when temperatures are warm. They readily spread with the wind and movement of infested plants. Adults commonly exit galls within a few days of emergence from the pupal stage. They migrate to other terminal leaves and start a new generation. Adults induce folded-leaf galls within 2 to 3 days of infesting a terminal. The life cycle from egg to adult requires about 30 days during the growing season. Gynaikothrips have several generations per year.",
        "damage": "Adult Gynaikothrips feed on new leaves, causing them to distort and deform. The leaf folds along the main vein and forms a permanent gall with dark brown, reddish, or purplish scarring. Prolonged feeding by high populations of adults and larvae can slow plant growth and cause premature drop of leaves.",
        "solutions": "Except for aesthetic damage, Gynaikothrips do not seriously harm ficus, so no control is needed if dis\u00adtorted foliage can be tolerated. Replace F. benjamina and F. microcarpa with a resistant Ficus species if these thrips' galling is intolerable. Alternatives include creeping fig (F. pumila), Moreton Bay fig (F. macrophylla), and rubber plant (F. elastica). Where this problem occurs and Indian laurel fig will be planted, consid\u00ader using F. microcarpa \u2018Green Gem\u2019, which is resistant to Cuban laurel thrips and weeping fig thrips. Common predators of thrips in galls include larvae of green lacewings and adults and nymphs of a minute pirate bug, Macrotracheliella nigra, which is dark reddish brown to black and less than 1/8 inch long. To conserve natural enemies control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small plants), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Prune and dispose of infested ter\u00adminals to improve plant appearance and reduce the abundance of these thrips. Win\u00adter may be the best time to prune off tips because more galled tissue generally does not form until next summer and relatively few thrips can survive the winter outside of the protection provided by the rolled leaves. Because they feed protected within galls, only a systemic insecticide (e.g., acephate, dinotefuran, imidacloprid) is likely to provide control and minimize the extent of future galling. These broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides are poisonous to natural enemies that have the potential to maintain populations of Gynaikothrips at relatively lower abundance. Because of their potential to poison adult natural enemies and pollinating insects that feed on nectar and pollen to which systemic insecticides can move, if used apply these insecticides shortly after the end of seasonal flowering.

Adults are 1/10 inch long, dark brown wasps with pale brown or orange antennae and legs and clear wings. The pale, legless larvae that feed in galls grow up to about 1/10 inch long. Note several other insects also cause galls on ficus. These inadvertently introduced pests and their host plants are native to Southeast Asia. Cuban laurel thrips, Gynaikothrips ficorum, and weeping fig thrips, G. uzeli. These look-alike thrips cause leaves of Indian laurel fig and weeping fig, respectively, to fold along the midvein and form a permanent gall.

        "damage": "Larvae feed inside young terminals, causing expanding leaves to develop spherical swellings. Infested leaves may curl, turn yellow, and drop prematurely. Because young leaves are especially susceptible to galling, damage can be most extensive on the new growth stimulated by recent pruning, such as on frequently pruned Indian laurel fig used as topiary plants. Although infestations are aesthetically undesirable, tree health and survival appear not to be threatened by the leaf galls. No control action is necessary to protect plant health and survival.",
        "solutions": "Avoid this damage by planting other Ficus species. Alternatives include creeping fig (F. pumila), Moreton Bay fig (F. macrophylla), and rubber plant (F. elastica). Pruning, bagging, and disposing of young infested leaves helps reduce local gall wasp populations, but pruning can stimulate excess succulent new growth that attracts the egg laying female wasps. Promptly raking and disposing of fallen leaves may help reduce subsequent infestations by removing some pupae before the wasps emerge as adults. Where damage is intolerable, applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., acephate, dinotefuran, imidacloprid) can help to reduce future damage. Because these broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides move into pollen and nectar on which adult natural enemies and pollinating insects feed, if used apply them shortly after the end of flowering to reduce subsequent galling.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/euroelmscale.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This scale insect (Eriococcidae) is a pest only on elms, Ulmus spp. The flattened, oval-shaped, young nymphs are orangish to yellow when on leaves and vary in appearance on bark. Females and males occur on bark mostly at the crotches of twigs, in cracks, and on the lower surface of limbs. The mature female is brownish to dark red or gray. Her body is surrounded by a feltlike or waxy, white fringe that covers the underside and sides. On top the body, the cover extends partially inward as toothlike extensions. Male nymphs develop into elongate, whitish puparia. These cocoonlike, nymphal skins are usually found in groups isolated from the females. Adult males are rarely seen; they have a reddish body, one pair of translucent to whitish wings, and two filaments projecting from their rear end. The scale overwinters as brownish, second instars on bark. Second instars gradually change in appearance and become wax covered as they mature into adults during February to April. A mature female may produce up to 400 eggs. Several eggs per day hatch into crawlers (mobile, first instars) from May through August. Nymphs feed on bark or the underside of leaves; those on leaves migrate to bark in the fall. The insect has one generation per year. Feeding by European elm scale can cause leaf yellowing and premature drop of foliage. The scale excretes copious honeydew, which attracts ants, makes a sticky mess, and promotes the growth of blackish sooty mold. When abundant over several years, the scale causes plant decline and the death of small branches. Keep trees healthy so they are more tolerant of insect feeding. American and European elms are adapted to summer rains; provide adequate irrigation in areas of summer drought. Introduced parasites, primarily Baryscapus coeruleus and Coccophagus insidiator, attack European elm scale at some locations in California. Parasite presence is evidenced by the round emergence holes of adult wasps in mature female scales. Increase the effectiveness of biological control by controlling honeydew-seeking ants and avoiding the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides. If the scales are intolerable, thoroughly spray infested bark with horticultural oil during the dormant season. A systemic insecticide may also provide control, but European elm scale in some locations apparently has become resistant to neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., dinotefuran, imidacloprid); where neonicotinoid insecticides have repeatedly been applied to elms they may no longer control European elm scale. If spraying horticultural oil or another contact insecticide during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers with several traps of double-sided tape wrapped around twigs. In spring or early summer, apply oil when crawler abundance declines after it has peaked. Because female scale density peaks in northern California at about 540 degree-days above 52\u00b0F accumulated from March 1, begin once-a-week monitoring of crawlers by about 400 degree-days if a foliar-season contact spray is planned. If scale-infested trees will be sprayed and are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem.

        "description": "When abundant, this armored scale (family Diaspididae) is a serious insect pest of Euonymus japonica. The mature female is much wider at one end, oystershell shaped, slightly convex, and blackish, dark brown, or dark purplish. The immature male (puparia) is white and elongate with three longitudinal ridges. On the narrow end of their covers, both genders have a brownish yellow area (exuviae, skin of earlier nymphal stage). The rarely seen adult male is delicate with one pair of wings and long antennae. At least nine similar-looking Lepidosaphes species of armored scale occur in California. These include oystershell scale, which is a pest mostly on poplars and willows, but can also occur on euonymus and numerous other hosts. Unlike euonymus scale, oystershell scale occurs only on bark and does not infest leaves. Euonymus scale develops through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The scale overwinters as mature females, which in spring produce eggs that hatch into orangish crawlers that emerge over a several-week period. Female nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages and males develop through four immature stages before maturing into adults. Euonymus scale has two or three generations per year. This scale feeds on at least 29 genera of plants as listed on ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but in California is generally a pest only on Euonymus species. The scale feeds on leaves and green stems, most importantly on E. japonica. Scale feeding causes brownish to yellow leaf spots, severe yellowing overall, and premature drop of foliage. Prolonged abundant scales cause the gradual decline and sometimes the death of E. japonica. Where this scale has been a problem, consider replacing and do not plant E. japonica. Euonymus kiautschovica (=E. sieboldiana) tolerates this scale and E. alata remains nearly scale-free even when heavy infestations occur on nearby susceptible hosts. Several parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on euonymus scale as listed at ScaleNet. Predators include an introduced lady beetle (Chilocorus kuwanae) that closely resembles the twicestabbed lady beetle (Chilocorus orbus), which also preys on euonymus scale. Adults of both predators are shiny black with two reddish spots. However, the spots of C. kuwanae tend to be deep red, somewhat rectangular, and located near the center of each wing cover. The spots of C. orbus tend to be more yellowish orange, round, and located more forward toward the head of the beetle. Larvae of both species are brownish with black spines. To conserve scale natural enemies, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Horticultural oil controls euonymus scale if foliage and shoots are thoroughly sprayed when crawlers are active in late winter or spring; one annual application during several consecutive growing seasons may be needed to sufficiently reduce high populations of this pest. See the section \"Monitoring\" in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time applications by monitoring scale crawlers using sticky tape traps.

        "description": "This snout beetle (Curculionidae), also called citrus root weevil or diaprepes, feeds on citrus and more than 270 species of plants in 59 plant families. This beetle was inadvertently introduced from the Caribbean and occurs in at least coastal areas of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties. Adults are hard bodied and about 3/8 to 3/4 inch long with a long, tapered head and mouthparts. Coloration varies greatly and ranges from black to gray, orange, or yellow. Adults are commonly a mix of colors including blackish streaks. Adults can live 4 to 5 months, during which time a female can lay more than 1,000 eggs. Eggs are oval, whitish, and about 1/25 inch long. They occur in groups of two to several dozen laid in a single layer in a gelatinous mass between leaves glued together. Larvae are legless grubs with a brown head. They grow up to 1 inch long while developing through 10 or 11 increasingly larger instars over a period of 4 to 15 months. Pupae occur in a soil cell. Monitor to confirm weevil presence. Dig and scrape away soil at the base of plants suspected of infestation and look for chewed roots and root crowns and the soil-dwelling weevil larvae and pupae. Examine hosts for chewed and notched leaves, frass (weevil excrement), and leaves glued together. Open glued leaves to observe whether diaprepes eggs are present. Place out special diaprepes traps. These consist of a base of black vanes that rest on the ground and as with a tree trunk induce adults to walk up and be caught in an inverted cup. Place tentlike metal screens under canopies and inspect inside these regularly for captured adults that emerged from soil. Diaprepes root weevil develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After hatching the larvae drop to the soil and move briefly on the surface before boring in to chew and feed on roots and root crowns. After feeding for several months, larvae mature and pupate in soil. Adults will not emerge from compacted, dry soil; adult emergence commonly occurs after irrigation or rainfall. Larvae chew roots and the root crown, causing severe decline or death of infested hosts. The nocturnal adults chew mostly young, tender leaves from the edges, causing irregular or semicircular notches and leaving dark frass (droppings) on foliage. If you find a weevil resembling Diaprepes abbreviatus in an area where it is not known to occur, place adults in a jar filled with rubbing alcohol and take them to the local county agricultural commissioner or University of California (UC) Cooperative Extension office for positive identification. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter or sandy) and not compacted or high in clay content. Soil must be warm (at least 60\u00b0F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) to soil or trunks may control both adults and larvae. Foliar sprays are generally not recommended because of limited efficacy and adults move between numerous plant species. If plants are especially susceptible to foliage damage, a persistent, broad-spectrum insecticide can be sprayed on leaves, such as carbaryl mixed with horticultural oil.

        "description": "This sucking insect (Asterolecaniidae) occurs on evergreen oaks and is common in southern California. Hosts include canyon live oak (Quercus chrysolepis), coast live oak (Q. agrifolia), and tanoak (Notholithocarpus densiflorus). To observe Ehrhorn's oak scale, look underneath the pale mycelia of an associated fungus that usually covers this scale on bark. The mature female scale is bright red, rounded to pyriform-shaped, and about 1/25 inch in diameter. The nymphs are smaller and pale orangish to red. Several species closely resemble Ehrhorn's oak scale. Kuwana oak scale, Kuwania quercus, in California occurs only on blue oak. It's feeding causes obvious roughening and flaking off of bark; the other species named here do not. Oak eriococcin, Acanthococcus quercus, occurs primarily on the bark of young shoots and small branches. Adult females are dark reddish-purple with a lighter, lengthwise stripe. Some individuals may be covered with powdery wax. Mature females produce a cottony, white egg sac. Oak xylococcus scale, Xylococculus quercus, adult females are 1/6 to 2/5 inch long, elongate-oval, and dull reddish brown. Females and the red nymphs occur in bark crevices, are covered with wax, and produce a single wax strand up to 1/2 inch long on bark. Ehrhorn's oak scale females and nymphs occur on bark under the white or grayish fungal mycelia of Septobasidium canescens. The fungus derives nourishment from honeydew produced by the scale. Heavy infestations of the scale-associated fungus give oak bark a whitewashed appearance. When abundant for a prolonged period, the scale and fungus can severely stress oaks and slow their growth. Horticultural oil applied to the underside of limbs with a high-pressure sprayer to penetrate growth of the associated fungus can reduce the scale's abundance. Spraying Bordeaux mixture or certain other copper fungicides may help to reduce scale populations indirectly by controlling the fungus, which may help to protect the scales from natural enemies and adverse environmental conditions. To avoid potential phytotoxicity (chemical damage to plants), do not apply Bordeaux during times of the year when temperatures may exceed about 85\u00b0F or when succulent, newly flushed leaves are present.

        "identification": "Cypress tipminer damage resembles that of certain webworms including the cypress leaftier, cypress webber, and juniper webworm and these species can occur together. Cypress tipminer damage may also be confused with foliage discoloring and twig dieback caused by juniper twig girdler and minute cypress scale. The larvae of cypress tipminer occur inside foliage and twigs and grow up to 1/4 inch long. They are yellowish green to pinkish with a darker head and prothoracic shield (area on top the first abdominal segment). Pupae occur in white, silken cocoons between twiglets. The adult cypress tipminer is a silvery, brown and whitish moth with a wingspan of about 1/3 inch.",
        "life_cycle": "Cypress tipminer has four stages of development - egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults can be found mostly from March through May in Southern California and during April and May in Northern California. Females lay flattened, ovoid eggs on green tips. The eggs soon hatch and larvae chew into branch tips and terminal foliage where they feed during summer through winter. During winter to spring, mature larvae exit mines to pupate on twiglets. Adults soon emerge and mate and the females lay eggs on hosts. There is one generation per year.",
        "damage": "Larvae chew inside foliage and small twigs, causing foliage to turn yellow, then brown and die. High populations of the tipminer can cause most of the plant's foliage to discolor. However, feeding damage is commonly limited to scattered, small areas of a plant. Foliage infested with cypress tipminer turns yellow in early winter and brown by late winter or early spring. The green color of plants is restored by new growth in the spring and summer. Although unsightly, even severe infestations do not kill plants. When growing in a nursery the discolored plants become unmarketable.",
        "solutions": "Where foliage damage from cypress tipminer cannot be tolerated, consider replacing plants especially susceptible to this pest. High populations of cypress tipminers and their damage that are intolerable can be reduced by applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) in mid to late winter or spraying a broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticide (e.g., carbaryl) when adult moths are active. This reduces foliage browning the next year. If hosts may be sprayed, examine foliage tips for the cocoons beginning in late winter. When cocoons appear, vigorously shake branches and watch to see if tiny, silvery moths fly from the foliage. One application to foliage can be made when a large number of tip moths appear, between March and May.

        "description": "At least six species of Susana sawflies (Tenthredinidae) in California feed as larvae on cypress, juniper, or both. Arborvitae and western red cedar are less-commonly fed upon hosts. Cypress sawfly, S. cupressi, is the most common pest and primarily occurs along the coast and in southern California.",
        "identification": "Sawflies are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the adult females' sawlike, abdominal appendage for inserting eggs into plant tissue. Adults are about 1/3 inch long and have a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Adults are stout and mostly black with some orange and yellow that varies by gender and species. Larvae are grayish green with a wrinkled surface and rows of whitish dots and at maturity are 2/3 to 4/5 inch long. Susana larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two through eight (seven pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Five or fewer abdominal segments have pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. Acantholyda and Neodiprion sawflies also feed on conifers and more than one species can occur together. Neodiprion species chew and feed openly on foliage, mostly on pines, and have relatively smooth skin in comparison with the wrinkled surface of Susana sawflies. Species of Acantholyda feed within silk nests and are called webspinning sawflies, or false webworms.",
        "life_cycle": "Cypress and juniper sawflies feed as larvae during late winter to early summer. Larvae develop through five or six, increasingly larger instars (growth stages) as they feed and chew foliage. Larvae mature by early summer, then drop to the ground. Each mature larva (prepupa) forms a cell in topsoil where it overwinters in a brownish, oval, papery cocoon. Pupation and adult emergence occur during late winter and spring. Adults emerge and mate, and females insert eggs in foliage mostly during February and March in southern California and about one month later in the San Francisco Bay Area. Susana species have one generation per year.",
        "damage": "The larvae chew foliage, often in groups. When abundant, they cause hosts to have a sparse canopy of clipped foliage and patches of bare stems. Although abundant larvae make plants unsightly, otherwise-healthy hosts tolerate the loss of some foliage. However, if conifers lose most of their foliage they may die, especially small or young hosts and those already unhealthy from other causes. Cypress and juniper sawfly numbers are low during most years, in part because they have many natural enemies. Sawfly feeding commonly is innocuous to moderate and this generally does not threaten the long-term health of plants.",
        "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on a small portion of the plant. The larvae are relatively easy to control if you thoroughly spray them directly with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not true caterpillars, which are the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera).

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/cypressbkmths.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Larvae of various bark moths, or coneworms (Tortricidae), bore in cedars, cypress, and false cypress (Chamaecyparis, Cryptomeria, Cupressus, and Thuja spp.) and other conifers. Infestations are especially common in Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) in coastal California.",
        "identification": "Cones with holes, brown to red frass (excrement), and silk webbing characterize an infestation of coneworms (the larvae of bark moths). Cypress may become so severely infested that the frass, which is held loosely together by larval webbing, appears to drip from the cone clusters. On Monterey cypress, larvae of C. cupressana and E. hopkinsana are found under the bark, in cones, and occasionally on foliage; only an expert can distinguish the species. Epinotia hopkinsana mostly infests pines. Cydia cupressana is the more common species in Monterey cypress. Cydia cupressana larvae are gray to white, have a brown head, and grow up to 1/2 inch long. The adult is a dark brown moth with transverse silver and gray bands on the forewings and a wingspan of about 1/2 inch. The eggs appear as small, ovoid discs and occur singly on cones and limbs.",
        "life_cycle": "In relatively undisturbed, natural stands of Monterey cypress in coastal areas, the larvae feed almost exclusively in cones and are innocuous. However, in urban areas where soils are fertilized and irrigated, cypress grow more rapidly especially when young; this accelerated growth results in unnaturally thin outer bark where the female moths are attracted to lay eggs. Larvae tunnel and feed under bark in urban areas during most anytime of the year. Inside the cones, the larvae feed mostly on the scale tissue. They feed on the seeds in spring when the immature cones are small and succulent. Cydia cupressana has two generations per year, and overwinters as larvae and pupae. In coastal areas, larvae feed continually during the winter, and in January begin to pupate. Adult females, emerge, mate, and lay eggs beginning in March. Larvae hatch, feed, and increase in size from March through August. By late August, the mature first-generation larvae begin to pupate into adults. Larvae of the second generation appear beginning in September. These larvae and many of the later-developing, first-generation (spring) larvae will overwinter. There is much overlap between the spring and fall generations. Adults and eggs can be present anytime from March to November.",
        "damage": "Feeding by the larvae can kill branches, which sometimes die back to the trunk. Coarse boring dust is seen on cones, trunk wounds, and branch crotches. Larvae often colonize cypress cankers, but they do not cause the cankers. Cypress bark moths do not kill trees or seriously damage otherwise healthy cypress.",
        "solutions": "Provide plants with proper cultural care. Avoid wounding bark. Avoid fertilization and excess irrigation, which promote rapid tree growth and thin bark susceptible to infestation; bark moth damage is prevalent on cypress in landscapes apparently because of cultural practices. Direct control is not usually warranted. For more information, see Cypress Bark Moth on Monterey Cypress. ",

        "description": "This armored scale (family Diaspididae) primarily infests and damages cycads, or sago palms (Cycas and Zamia species), and less commonly bird of paradise.",
        "identification": "Adult females and nymphs occur on fronds (or leaves of hosts other than cycads) and the rachises (stems). Mature females are 1/25 to 1/10 inch long, oval to oblong, and moderately to strongly convex. The cover is white with a yellow or whitish exuvia (attached skin of earlier nymphal stage) at one end. The scale's cover is commonly covered with fine, woolly threads of white wax. Beneath the cover the scale's body is yellow. Nymphs resemble small females. Males are unknown in this species. Cycad scale resembles oleander scale. Both species occur on bird of paradise, cycads, and various other hosts, but oleander scale generally does not harm plants. Adult females of oleander scale are mostly tan or yellowish with a roundish cover. Males are common in oleander scale; males have translucent white covers through which the scale\u2019s body is partly visible. Oleander scale females are normally flat on most hosts, but on the narrow, curled leaves of some cycads they are more convex like cycad scale. In comparison with cycad scale, oleander scale females are more roundish, yellowish or tan, and have the exuvia (somewhat raised, differently colored area) near the center of the cover, not near one end as with cycad scales. Oleander scale generally can be ignored, while cycad scale when abundant warrants management action. If it is uncertain which species is infesting cycads, consider submitting samples to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension for identification.",
        "life_cycle": "Cycad scale develops through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Eggs hatch within the body of the adult female and emerge as crawlers (mobile first instars). Nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages before maturing into adults. There are about two generations per year.",
        "damage": "Cycad scale sucks and feeds on the fronds or leaves and rachis or stems of hosts. On bird of paradise and cycads, it causes severe yellow spotting or mottling of foliage. When abundant, cycad scale stunts the growth of cycads, which are expensive and generally slow-growing plants. Prolonged high populations can cause premature death of cycads. Other hosts of cycad scale include Aralia, Cussonia, Maytenus, Musa, Rhus, Thevetia, Trachycarpus, and Strelitzia species; however the scale generally does not significantly damage these plants. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of hosts and references for more information.",
        "solutions": "When the scale is abundant, control is warranted. Infested fronds and rachis can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the late winter or spring.

        "name": "Bronze birch borer",
        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/bronzebirchborer.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This flatheaded borer (family Buprestidae) infests only birch. It can cause dieback of limbs and death of entire trees. Adult bronze birch borers are oblong, dark metallic, coppery beetles about 3/8 inch long. Their feeding causes inconspicuous chewing on leaf edges of alder, birch, and poplar. D-shaped, smooth-edged holes occur in bark where adults emerged after feeding and boring inside during their larval stage. Larvae occur hidden under bark. They are legless and pale with distinct segments and an enlarged head and grow up to 1/2 inch long. The many similar Agrilus species include bronze poplar borer (A. liragus), which infests Populus species (aspen, cottonwood, and poplar). Emerald ash borer (A. planipennis), which occurs in the eastern and midwestern United States, has killed millions of ash trees. For information on other Agrilus species see Guide to Insect Borers in North American Broadleaf Trees and Shrubs from the USDA Forest Service. Birch can also be infested with other boring insects. For information on these see Pest Notes: Bark Beetles and Pest Notes: Clearwing Moths. Flatheaded borers develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adult females lay eggs in crevices and wounds of birch bark on sunny portions of limbs and trunks. The hatching larvae chew through bark and into phloem and xylem tissue, packing frass (excrement) in their tunnels as they feed and grow. Mature larvae tunnel in the outer sapwood, where they overwinter. In spring, larvae chew an oblong chamber beneath bark and pupate. Adults emerge in Northern California beginning in April, then mate and reproduce. There is one generation per year. Foliage of borer-infested trees turns pale green, yellow, and then brown. Leaves drop prematurely and scattered limbs die. Swollen ridges develop on branches and the trunk where larvae tunnel beneath bark. Liquid oozes from bark, creating stained blotches. Severely infested trees die prematurely. To prevent infestations, provide trees with a good growing environment and proper cultural care. Birch require more water than most other trees, so good soil conditions, healthy roots, and appropriate irrigation are especially critical. Birch typically have an especially short life span in California in hot, dry interior areas; avoid planting birch where summers are dry and hot. To minimize problems with bronze birch borer Do not plant birch where they will be exposed to heat stress, such as the south and west sides of buildings. Plant at the most suitable location, such as the east side of buildings where heat stress is typically less severe. Avoid planting white-barked birch species (e.g., Betula jacquemontii, B. pendula), which are especially susceptible to bronze birch borer. If planting birch, consider using Betula alleghaniensis, B. lenta, or B. nigra. Borers attack all birch, but these species appear to be less susceptible in California. Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and keep roots cooler. Provide sufficient irrigation, such as deep watering about every 1 to 2 weeks during prolonged dry weather. Do not fertilize birch unless nutrient deficiency has been confidently diagnosed as the cause of poor growth. Fertilization can increase birch\u2019s demand for water, thereby increasing tree stress. Promptly remove dead and dying birch. Chip the wood or cut it into logs and solarize it under clear plastic to prevent adult borers from emerging and infesting nearby birch. Regularly monitor valued birches from mid-April through summer, looking for bark swelling and stains. Prune off and dispose of any infested branches before mid-September. Except for removing borer-infested and hazardous limbs whenever they appear, prune birch during late fall through March when adult bronze birch borers are not flying. If the critical cultural and environmental practices summarized above have been followed and bronze birch borer is a local problem, spraying birch thoroughly about twice (once during April and again about late May) with a pyrethroid insecticide (e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin) can kill adults and larvae hatching from eggs before larvae bore into wood. A professional applicator must be hired to apply an effective product using equipment that provides good spray coverage. To increase the likelihood of a satisfactory experience, see Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. Application of a systemic insecticide (e.g., dinotefuran) may provide some control if trees are relatively healthy and contain relatively few or no borers. Treatment can be warranted where nearby birch are infested and a source of borers. To minimize the potential adverse effect on pollinating insects, make any application of systemic insecticide soon after trees have completed flowering. See Homeowner Guide to Managing Bronze Birch Borer in the Upper Klamath Basin (PDF) for more information on this pest and how to protect pollinators when managing it with insecticides. Severely infested trees will die regardless of treatment. Promptly remove birch that are highly infested, dying, or dead. Chip the wood or cut and solarize it under plastic to prevent borers from emerging to attack other birch. Do not rely on insecticide application alone or trees are likely to die from the cultural and environmental problems that caused them to become susceptible to attack by borers.

        "name": "Brown soft scale",
        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/brnsoft.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This soft scale (family Coccidae) generally does not threaten the health of plants it infests, but its copious honeydew and the resulting blackish sooty mold can be annoying. Brown soft scale prefers broadleaf evergreens, but it can occur on the leaves and twigs of almost any broadleaved plant. Brown soft scale females are oval, slightly convex in profile, and yellowish to dark or light brown. Mature females are 1/10 to 1/6 inch long. The scale occurs on leaves or twigs and rarely on fruit. Citricola scale resembles brown soft scale and both species can occur on citrus and hackberry (Celtis species). However, citricola scale has only one generation per year so its individuals are uniform in size unlike the differing age (size) in colonies of brown soft scale. Citricola scale occurs on leaves only during the summer and fall and on twigs in the late fall, winter, and spring. Brown soft scale is present on twigs throughout the year and on leaves when present, such as overwinter on evergreen hosts. Female brown soft scales lay a few eggs at a time over an extended period, mostly throughout the summer. Eggs hatch almost immediately, and the crawlers (mobile first instars) soon settle and feed. Nymphs molt twice and mature into females. No males have been observed in California. Several different-sized life stages usually occur together at the same time. Populations are usually highest from midsummer to early fall. Brown soft scale has three to five generations per year. Brown soft scales suck phloem sap and excrete sticky honeydew on which grows blackish sooty mold. However even when very abundant this scale appears to have no significant adverse effect on its host. Hosts are numerous and include aspen, avocado, bay laurel, citrus, cottonwood, holly, manzanita, palm, poplar, strawberry tree, and willow. See the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ScaleNet database for a complete list of the plants this scale can infest. Predators and especially tiny, parasitic wasps can provide effective biological control of brown soft scale if conservation of natural enemies is practiced. To improve the effectiveness of natural enemies, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Parasitic wasps attacking brown soft scale include Metaphycus angustifrons, M. luteolus, M. stanleyi, and Coccophagus species. The female parasites primarily lay their eggs in the early instars, before scales mature and can produce offspring. Because brown soft scale generations overlap, it provides parasites with the nymphal stages susceptible to parasitism throughout the year. Parasitism of brown soft scale is very effective unless disrupted by ants, dust, or broad-spectrum, persistent pesticides. Evidence of parasitism includes exit holes of adult parasites in nymphs or mature females. When parasitized, nymphs may turn black. The immature Metaphycus parasites themselves (larvae and pupae) can sometimes be observed through the cuticle (outer covering) of brown soft scale. The Australian lady beetle (Rhyzobius lophanthae), brown lacewings, green lacewings, and twicestabbed lady beetle prey on all stages of brown soft scale. During the scale's adult stage, early instars of the lady beetles can feed beneath their host so they are easily overlooked. In locations with hot summers, pruning to open plant canopies can increase scale mortality from heat exposure and improve parasite access to this pest. When direct control is warranted, after employing the natural enemy conservation practices, infested terminals can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/blvinwee.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "The black vine weevil feeds on many garden and landscape plants. Hosts include azalea, caneberries, rhododendron, euonymus, grape, liquidambar, and strawberry. Adult weevils are hard-bodied, flightless, snout beetles (Curculionidae) about 1/2 inch long. They are black with small patches of white scales on the forewings. Adults have elbowed (sharply bent), clubbed antennae and their head and mouthparts are elongated. Adults spend the day hidden beneath loose bark, and in litter on the ground and topsoil. Adults emerge at night to chew and feed on foliage. Note that several other common weevils resemble black vine weevil and they have similar biology. Eggs are round and pale orangish. They occur in soil around the base of plants. Larvae are oblong and whitish to pale yellow with a brown head. They grow to about 1/2 inch long and occur hidden in soil, feeding on roots and the basal stem. Larvae are legless and when disturbed or exposed commonly have a C-shaped posture. Black vine weevil develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Overwintering is primarily as late instars (older larvae) or prepupae. A few individuals may overwinter as adults. Weevils overwintering as late instars pupate in late winter to spring. Adult weevils emerge in spring and chew and feed on the foliage of host plants, mostly at night. Adults do not fly, but may walk to new plantings from nearby infested garden plants, ornamentals, and unmanaged vegetation. Peak adult populations and leaf chewing occur in summer and early fall. Female weevils feed for several weeks before laying eggs. About 4 weeks after adults emerge and begin chewing foliage, eggs are laid in soil near the base of plants. A single female can lay as many as 500 eggs. Eggs hatch into larvae that develop through 6, increasingly larger instars as they feed underground over a period of 8 to 10 months. There is generally 1 generation per year. Adults chew and feed on foliage. Host leaves or flowers can become notched or ragged, and leaves or needles may be clipped from twigs. Where bud break coincides with adult emergence, a high percentage of primary buds and new shoot tips may be consumed. The most serious plant damage is done by larvae, which chew on basal crowns and roots. Larval feeding can kill or weaken certain hosts, especially azalea and rhododendron. Feeding by larvae can also increase damage from root diseases such as Phytophthora root rot. If planting azalea or rhododendron, select cultivars that are less susceptible to weevils. Check roots of new plants before planting to make sure they are free from larvae. Provide a good growing environment and proper cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate insect feeding. Handpick and destroy adults beginning in spring to reduce the later abundance of larvae and their feeding damage. For example, where leaf notching is observed, after nightfall shake or branch beat plant parts over a sheet or other collecting surface; gather and crush or dispose of any dislodged weevils. Trapping can reduce adult abundance. One strategy is to wrap trunks overnight with burlap or corrugated cardboard, then during the day remove and inspect wraps and dispose of any weevils that sought shelter there. Pitfall traps such as cups buried in soil near the base of plants can also be used. Trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material (e.g., Tanglefoot) to trunks to prevent the flightless beetles from climbing trunks to feed on foliage. First wrap the trunk several inches wide with landscape fabric or plastic, then apply the sticky material on top the wrap to avoid potential bark injury from the sticky material. Periodically replace wraps to prevent growth-restriction damage to trunks. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter or sandy) and not compacted. Apply nematodes when weevil larvae are expected to be present in midsummer to fall. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Soil must be warm (at least 60\u00b0F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. If damage has been intolerable, monitor plants in spring. About 1 week after adult chewing is first observed, spinosad can be sprayed on leaves in the evening; because of its short persistence, repeat application 7 to 10 days later may be warranted. If plants are especially susceptible to damage, a more persistent insecticide (e.g., carbaryl) can be applied. If weevil emergence is prolonged and new leaf chewing continues to appear, a second foliar spray may be made about 3 to 4 weeks after the first application. Applying a systemic insecticide such as imidacloprid to soil or trunks can control both adults and larvae.

        "description": "Ash plant bugs are in the plant bug family Miridae. They occur throughout the United States on ash and may occasionally feed on nearby plants if ash becomes heavily infested and defoliated. Depending on the species, adults may be yellow, brown, or black and nymphs may be light brown or green with black spots. Ash plant bugs overwinter as eggs in twig bark. These hatch in February or March and the nymphs feed until they mature in April or May. The adults feed until June or July when they lay eggs. Ash plant bugs have one or two generations a year. Nymphs and adults suck plant juices from ash leaves, twigs, flowers, and seeds. Ash plant bug damage usually consists of leaf stippling as well as varnishlike specks. Tiny, dark spots of excrement may be visible on foliage. Extreme infestations can defoliate trees.",

        "description": "Feeding by this aphid (Aphididae), also named leafcurl ash aphid, causes Fraxinus spp. leaves to curl, distort, form \u201cpseudogalls,\u201d and drop prematurely. The aphids are pear shaped, 1/8 inch long or less, and cover themselves with white wax. Their body is pale green or yellowish and has no distinct cornicles, a pair of tubelike projections near the hind end of the body that distinguishes most aphid species from other insects. Several Prociphilus spp. aphids are reported on ash and they can be difficult to distinguish. The same species of aphid may look different depending on the host plant, season, and the part of the plant it is feeding on. Ash leafcurl aphids overwinter as eggs on bark and nymphs on roots. The aphids can be abundant on leaves from spring through fall. Throughout most of the growing season, adult females (which may be winged or wingless) give birth to live young without mating. In the fall, a sexual generation of winged males and females is produced and the aphids mate and disperse. They have several generations per year. Aphid-infested ash leaves curl, distort, and drop prematurely. The aphids excrete copious honeydew and flocculent waxy material, making a mess beneath trees and promoting the growth of dark sooty mold. Abundant winged aphids can be a nuisance when they migrate between bark, foliage, or roots, especially in the fall. Certain ash species and cultivars appear to be less susceptible to ash leafcurl aphid, but there are no research-based recommendations that identify resistant ash. The aphids apparently do not harm trees in landscapes, but their root feeding can damage small plants in nurseries. Generally, no control is needed in landscapes to protect the survival of otherwise healthy trees. Where intolerable, they are difficult to manage without using systemic insecticide. Consult the Pest Notes: Aphids for more information.",

        "identification": "American plum borer attacks some of the same hosts as other borers, including clearwing moths, flatheaded borers, and shothole borer, but their cultural and physical controls differ. Before taking control action, distinguish among these pests, such as by using a hand lens to examine the arrangement of small hooks on the bottom of larval prolegs. American plum borer adults are gray moths with brown and black wing markings. Larvae are dull green, pinkish, or white. Both are up to about 1 inch long.",
        "life_cycle": "Beginning in about April, adults emerge, mate, and the female moths lay eggs in bark wounds. The newly hatched larvae immediately enter the wound to chew and feed on the underlying cambium. Larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars. Mature larvae pupate in a silk cocoon in bark crevices or damaged wood in trees. They overwinter as mature larvae in a cocoon within the tree. American plum borer has three to four generations per year.",
        "damage": "Larvae feed in cambium around main branch crotches, the lower trunk, and root crown, causing extensive gumming, reddish orange frass, and webbing. This weakens limbs, which often break during windy conditions, and sometimes kills young trees.",
        "solutions": "Avoid bark wounds; larvae can enter cambium only through relatively fresh bark wounds. Pruning cuts, injuries from sunburn or weed trimmers, and bacterial galls and canker fungi make trees highly susceptible to infestation. Take protective measure, such as whitewashing, or painting lower trunks of young trees with interior white latex diluted with an equal amount of water to prevent sunburn. Where damage is unavoidable or already present, a residual, contact insecticide can be applied from about 1 foot above the main lower branch crotch to the soil line. A professional applicator usually must be hired to apply an effective product and rate for trunk application.",

        "description": "The green fruit beetle (scarab, family Scarabaeidae), is also called a figeater beetle, green fig beetle, or western green June beetle. The adults are an occasional pest of ripe fruits. Adults can fly a relatively long distance and are highly attracted to ripe fruit and the odors of manure and fermenting fruit.",
        "identification": "The adult is a large beetle 3/4 to 1-1/3 inches long. From above it has no apparent hairs and is mostly metallic green with brown or tan along the outside margins of the wing covers. The head has a short, hornlike projection on the face (frons). Its body is oval shaped with prominent legs. The antennae are clubbed with multiple plates (lamellae) at the tip, which is characteristic of adult scarabs. The grublike larvae are brownish to dirty white. They grow up to 2 inches long and have short brown legs. Larvae feed beneath the surface of organic matter and when exposed they commonly roll onto their back and propel themselves using the stiff dark hairs on their back. Exposed larvae tend to dig their way back down into organic debris and away from sunlight. Lookalikes. Adults of other beetles that are coppery brown, green, or both are sometimes mistaken for green fruit beetles. Perhaps the most common confusion is with Japanese beetle, which is a serious pest in the Eastern United States but is not established in California. The California Department of Food and Agriculture (CDFA) throughout the state maintains traps for detecting this pest. Where Japanese beetles have been found in California they are targeted for eradication (complete elimination). Adults of other species that resemble green fruit beetle all lack the horn on the front of the face. Lookalikes include: Dogbane beetle (Chrysochus auratus) is a leaf beetle (family Chrysomelidae) about 2/5 inch long. In comparison with scarabs, the dogbane beetle is longer relative to its width and lacks the distinctly swollen plates at the tip of antennae. Green June beetle, or eastern green June beetle (Cotinis nitida), is virtually identical to green fruit beetle. An expert dissection and examination of male genitalia may be required to confidently distinguish these species. In California, green June beetle is reported only in the southern part of the state. Adults are 3/5 to 9/10 inch long, on average smaller than green fruit beetle and more variable in color. Hairy beetle, or little bear beetle (Paracotalpa granicollis), is about 3/4 inch long. It has mostly brown wing covers and numerous, long, whitish hairs on the sides and top of the abdomen and thorax. Japanese beetle (Popillia japonica) has 12 patches of short, white hairs projecting around the abdomen; no other coppery and green beetles have these clumps of hairs. The adult is one-half or less the size of green fruit beetle. Report any suspected findings of Japanese beetle in California to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner or telephone the CDFA Pest Hotline at 800-491-1899. ",
        "life_cycle": "Green fruit beetle develops through 4 life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After adults mate, the females lay elliptical to oval, white eggs about 1/10 inch long just beneath the surface of organic matter such compost piles, lawn clippings, organic mulch, and manure. Eggs hatch into larvae in about 1 week. As they feed on the decaying organic matter, the larvae develop through 3 increasingly larger instars. During spring, larvae mature and pupate in a cell of soil particles. Adults can be present from late spring through early fall. Green fruit beetles overwinter as larvae and have 1 generation per year spent mostly in the larval stage.",
        "damage": "Adult green fruit beetles chew maturing soft fruit and damage fruit by aggregating on it when mating. The adults are an occasional pest of ripe apricots, caneberries, figs, grapes, peaches, and plums. The grubs (larvae) do not damage fruit or plants; they burrow and feed in piles of decomposing organic matter.",
        "solutions": "To help avoid this beetle's damage, consider planting cultivars that ripen early instead of those that ripen late. Harvest fruit early and dispose of fallen fruit. No insecticide application is recommended for green fruit beetle. Manage grubs to prevent feeding damage by adults. Thinly spread or remove all piles of compost, lawn clippings, leaves, and manure that are near fruit trees. To exclude beetles, compost within screened bins or turn compost piles frequently to speed decomposition and to expose grubs, which you can crush or leave exposed where they may be eaten by birds or other wildlife. Although managing organic matter is more effective at reducing green fruit beetle abundance, some of the adults may be captured using homemade traps. Attract adults with a 1:1 mixture of grape or peach juice and water. Place several inches of this liquid bait in a 1 gallon container and in the opening insert a funnel of wire mesh with its widest opening facing up. Beetles attracted by the bait will land in the funnel and be guided to walk down into the container. Once inside, adults will be unable to escape.

        "identification": "Brown mite becomes active in late winter, sooner than most other spider mites. Adults are about twice the size of most spider mites found in California. The body is oval, slightly flattened, and olive green to rusty brown. The front pair of legs are distinctly longer than the other legs. Eggs are red and spherical and do not have a stalk arising from the top, unlike the red eggs of citrus red mite and European red mite. Larvae are bright red with three pairs of legs. After the first molt, nymphs become brown to greenish with eight legs and resemble adults.",
        "life_cycle": "Brown mite develops through 5 life stages: egg, 6-legged larva, 8-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. Brown mites overwinter as eggs in masses on bark. Eggs are laid under bark scales and at the base of buds. Eggs hatch at the same time as leaf and flower buds open, commonly 1 to 2 weeks before the egg hatch of European red mite, which can occur on the same hosts. Brown mite egg hatch is completed before full bloom. The mites feed on both sides of leaves. During the warmest part of the day, brown mites move off leaves and rest on shaded bark. When temperatures are cool, they move back onto leaves and feed during the night through the morning. Adult females live 2 to 3 weeks and reproduce without mating. Males are not know to occur in this species. Brown mites are not active during hotter periods of the summer and their abundance declines in midsummer and early fall. Eggs laid during hot weather will not hatch until the following spring. About 2 to 3 generations of brown mite occur, mostly during late winter and spring.",
        "damage": "Feeding by brown mites causes whitish gray spots on leaves. Damaged leaves become mottled, then bleached overall. Leaves fed upon by numerous mites become stunted and remain smaller than normal. This mite does not produce obvious webbing and its feeding rarely causes premature leaf drop.",
        "solutions": "Hot weather and predators cause brown mite populations to decline in summer. Western predatory mite may be brown mite's most important natural enemy. Insect predators of brown mite include brown lacewings, green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, spider mite destroyer lady beetle (ladybug), and sixspotted thrips. To improve the effectiveness of naturally occurring mite predators, control ants, minimize dust (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. In-season sprays for brown mites are generally not warranted in residential trees to protect fruit yield or quality. If brown mite has been a problem, wait until the delayed-dormant season when buds have swollen but before they open. Then apply narrow-range or horticultural oil to thoroughly cover buds and bark.

        "description": "Amorbia (a tortricid, family Tortricidae), also called western avocado leafroller, is primarily a pest of avocado. It sporadically damages citrus, mostly when grown near avocado. Other hosts include bay laurel, hollyleaf cherry, madrone, manzanita, photinia, and pyracantha.",
        "identification": "Amorbia adults (moths) are bell shaped at rest as is typical for tortricid moths. Their variably colored forewings are mostly orangish to tan with dark markings. Adults are about 1 inch long, about twice the size of the similar-looking adult orange tortrix. The eggs are disk shaped and pale green. They are laid on leaves in an overlapping mass of 5 to 50 eggs, resembling fish scales. Larvae (caterpillars) are yellowish green when young. They become darker green as they mature and grow up to 1 inch long. Amorbia larvae can be distinguished from all other caterpillars in avocado and citrus by the dark horizontal line on each side of the larva's head and another line above the first pair of legs. As with larvae of orange tortrix and other tortricids, amorbia larvae commonly wriggle repeatedly and drop suspended on a silk thread when disturbed. Pupae are 1/2 to 3/4 inch long and usually occur in leaves rolled by the larvae. Initially pupae are pale green, gradually turn tan, and become brown shortly before the adult emerges. ",
        "life_cycle": "Amorbia develops through 4 life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The adult female lays about 150 to 200 eggs during her 2 to 3 week life span. After hatching, larvae develop through 5 increasingly larger instars. Larvae (caterpillars) prefer to feed on new growth flushes but will also chew older leaves and fruit. They roll and tie leaves together with silk or tie leaves to fruit and feed within this protected shelter. After petal fall, young larvae will feed underneath the calyx on fruit rinds. Mostly where fruit touch other fruit or leaves, older larvae will also chew on the peel of fruit and sometimes into the flesh. Amorbia develops through 2 to 3 generations a year in Southern California and the San Joaquin Valley. Adult flights generally occur in the early spring, midsummer, and autumn.",
        "damage": "Otherwise healthy trees tolerate extensive larval feeding on leaves. Where young larvae have fed under or around the fruit calyx, rinds develop discolored scars that resemble the feeding damage of avocado thrips or citrus thrips. Amorbia scarring of fruit rinds can be deeper than that of thrips. Elsewhere on avocado rinds, the feeding scars of amorbia are commonly circular. This damage is just aesthetic and does not affect the internal quality of fruit. Older larvae may also chew holes through the fruit rind or skin, causing fruit to become unappetizing or colonized by decay microorganisms.",
        "solutions": "Numerous natural enemies can keep amorbia abundance and damage low unless disrupted by the application of broad-spectrum insecticides. Natural enemies include tachinid flies, some of which lay their oval white eggs externally on caterpillars. The most important natural enemies of caterpillars are parasitic wasps such as Brachymeria ovata and Hyposoter exiguae. Many of these parasites also prey on other caterpillar species that can be present such as omnivorous looper and orange tortrix. Tiny, egg-parasitic Trichogramma wasps parasitize and kill the eggs. Eggs parasitized by Trichogramma become black to dark, unlike the lighter color of unparasitized eggs. Control ants, reduce dust (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum insecticides for all pests on avocado and citrus trees to increase the effectiveness of natural enemies. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more tips on conserving natural enemies. Pruning trees to minimize dead twig and plant debris accumulation in canopies reduces the hiding places for amorbia and helps to reduce its abundance. Where fruit is excessively abundant, removing some of the fruit in a cluster also reduces caterpillar hiding places and contributes to the remaining fruit growing larger. Control weeds because some of these can host amorbia and other species of caterpillars that move to fruit trees as adults. Where caterpillar chewing on fruit has been a problem during the previous growing seasons, monitor trees once fruit is present. Inspect foliage and fruit that touch other fruit or leaves in the outer canopy and look for caterpillars, chewing damage, rolled leaves, and silk webbing. If only a few caterpillars or their egg masses are found, these can be crushed or the infested foliage clipped off and disposed of in the trash. If caterpillars are abundant, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad can be sprayed to thoroughly cover outer canopy foliage. Adding horticultural oil to the spinosad can increase its efficacy persistence and also control moth eggs and certain other pests that are directly contacted by the spray. Avoid applying spinosad to plants in bloom because it is toxic to bees and certain natural enemies.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/grerineummte.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This eriophyid mite (family Eriophyidae) can affect grapevines wherever they grow. The mite can be common on vines not sprayed with sulfur to control powdery mildew or other pests because sulfur also controls the mites. There are at least three strains of the mite (bud strain, leaf-curl strain, and erineum strain), which may be different species. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants.",
        "identification": "Because the mites are minute, their presence is generally diagnosed by their characteristic damage symptoms. Feeding by the erineum strain causes roundish, warty swellings on the upper surface of grape leaves and discolored, felty, roundish patches (erinea) in depressions on the underside of leaves. The plant symptoms from the bud strain and leaf-curl strain of the mite can be less obvious as described below under \u201cDamage.\u201d The mites are carrot or wedge shaped, pale yellow to whitish, and about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long. Deutonymphs (first-stage immatures) are about one-half the length of adults. Protonymphs (older immatures) are about the same length as adults. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the head (wider) end of their body. The oval eggs are translucent to white and about one-fourth the length of adults.",
        "life_cycle": "Grape erineum mite develops through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The mites of all three strains overwinter under bud scales and in crevices of terminal twigs. Unlike the erineum strain that moves from overwintering buds to feed on young leaves, the bud mite strain and leaf-curl strain remain feeding in buds throughout the year. Because the mites actively move, they can be found on any plant part. They readily spread as contaminants on animals (e.g., insects), equipment, and hands that contact grape and by splashing rain and wind. During warm weather, development of eggs into reproductive, adult females occurs in 2 to 3 weeks. Grape erineum mite has several generations per year. Erineum strain. When newly flushing leaves develop in spring, the mites move from buds to feed in groups on the underside of succulent, immature leaves. Mite feeding causes the plant to produce masses of enlarged leaf hairs (erinea) in a depression. As the mites reproduce and increase in abundance, some move to new locations on the same leaf or other leaves. Erinea form 10 to 30 days after the mites start feeding, varying with the rate of leaf development. The mites are unable to induce formation of new erinea once leaves mature and harden. From mid-August through leaf drop, the mites move to bud scales where they overwinter. ",
        "damage": "This species feeds only on grapes. Although feeding of grape erineum mite alters the appearance and growth of infested grapes, infestation by these mites may not reduce the yield amount or quality of grapes. The mite may also vector Grapevine pinot gris virus, which causes leaf deformation and mottling and stunted shoot growth. Whether the virus is of importance in residential grapevines is uncertain. Bud mite strain. This strain of C. vitis feeds in buds and does not induce the production of erinea. Infested buds can be killed, so no shoots emerge from them. Lateral shoots may proliferate from where the terminal bud was killed. If tissue grows from the infested buds, it can be blisterlike. There can be scaring of twig bark, flattened canes, and shortened internodes that give growth a bushy (witches' broom) appearance. Erineum strain. Hemispherical, warty growths on the upper leaf surface corresponding to the location\u2019s felty masses on the leaf underside are the main damage symptoms of feeding by the erineum strain of the mite. For years this was the only recognized mite strain and type of damage caused by grape erineum mite. The leaf swellings early in the growing season are initially green, then turn yellow and by August become brown. The erineum patches on the underside are initially whitish, then turn yellow and finally reddish brown. Some infested leaves may only partly expand and can die and drop prematurely. Leaf-curl strain. Mites feeding in leaf buds results in downward curling of emerging leaves, ranging from slight curling to severe curling into a ball. Affected leaves may be associated with stunted shoots, increased growth of lateral shoots, scaring of shoot bark, and necrosis (darkening) of leaves' underside. As with the bud mite strain, erinea are not induced by feeding of the leaf-curl strain.",
        "solutions": "No control is warranted as this mite's feeding generally does not affect fruit yield. If the mite's damage to grapes is intolerable, micronized or wettable sulfur can be applied around bud break to reduce the abundance of grape erineum mite and powdery mildew. Applying sulfur in the fall after harvest but before leaf drop can reduce mite damage the following growing season. To better time a fall application, wrap several grape twigs near distorted, mite-infested leaves with double-sided, transparent sticky tape as pictured in Grape Erineum Mite: Postharvest Sulfur Use Reduces Subsequent Leaf Blistering (PDF). Remove, examine under magnification, and replace these tape traps at least weekly. Apply sulfur when abundant mites are caught in the traps as they migrate from leaves to overwinter on buds, generally during late September through October. Note that spraying sulfur during hot weather or within 1 month before or after applying horticultural (narrow-range) oil can damage foliage.

After overwintering as pupae, moths emerge in April or May and lay flat, elliptical eggs singly on either the upper or lower surface of the leaf. Many are deposited against the leaf veins on the underside of the leaf. After hatching, larvae feed between two webbed leaves for about 2 weeks. Then each pale green larva rolls a leaf edge and feeds from the inside on the leaf edge. Larvae turn darker green as a result of this leaf feeding.

        "description": "Apple maggot is native to the northeastern United States and Canada. It was not discovered attacking apples until about 100 years after trees were introduced from Europe. It is now considered a major pest of apples in several apple-growing regions because it directly damages the fruit. Apple maggot is currently established only in northern California from Sonoma County north. It is established in Del Norte, Siskiyou, Humbolt, Trinity, Shasta, and Sonoma counties in California. Please report sightings in other counties to your county agricultural commissioners.",
        "identification": "Adult maggots have clear wings with black bands, a pronounced white spot on the back of the thorax, and a black abdomen with light crossbands. Females have four crossbands on the abdomen; males have three. Apple maggot is closely related to walnut husk fly and cherry fruit fly. It can be distinguished from these other pests by the banding on its wings.",
        "life_cycle": "Apple maggots overwinter as pupae in the soil. Generally there is one generation a year, although there may be a partial second generation in warm years. Adults emerge in mid-June to early July; emergence usually peaks between mid- and late July and is over by late August. In some places, some of the pupae may remain in the soil and will not emerge until the following year. When flies emerge in summer, they are sexually immature and must feed on honeydew produced by aphids, psyllids, and scales before they are ready to mate. Female flies lay eggs singly under the skin of apples and then mark the apple with a pheromone to keep other females from laying eggs. Females lay about 300 eggs over a 30-day life span. Eggs hatch in 2 to 10 days, depending on temperature. Larvae are cream colored with a blunt posterior and a tapered front end that contains two black mouth hooks. They feed within the apple and pass through three instars before completing developing in 20 to 30 days. Infested fruit fall to the ground; larvae leave the fruit, burrow into the soil, and molt into a fourth instar and then into a pupal stage to overwinter.",
        "damage": "In soft-fleshed apple varieties a small, dark, decayed spot occurs at the oviposition site. In hard-fleshed varieties, the oviposition site results in a dimple. Young larvae tunnel throughout the apple flesh, leaving a small, brown, irregular, threadlike trail. The tunnels enlarge as the larvae grow; eventually decay organisms enter the fruit and cause internal rotting and fruit drop.",
        "solutions": "Sanitation is very important in controlling apple maggot. Clean up fallen fruit and discard. To detect presence of adults, hang yellow sticky traps in trees; traps attract flies in search of food. If you find apple maggot in counties where it has not been reported, contact your local Agricultural Commissioner's Office or UC Cooperative Extension office. Sticky red sphere traps hung in trees can help control maggots. Applications of spinosad made mid-July and repeated every 7 to 10 days if necessary can also help control this pest. ",

        "description": "Larvae (caterpillars) of tussock moths (Lymantriidae) feed at least occasionally on most any species of deciduous and evergreen trees.",
        "identification": "Adults are hairy and brown, gray, or white moths. Males have a wingspan of about 1-1/2 inches. Females of some species appear to be wingless. The tiny, whitish eggs occur in a mass of several hundred, covered with the female's brownish hairs. A tussock moth egg mass closely resembles the hair-covered pupal case. Pupae occur on or near the host plant. Young larvae are hairy and black. Full-grown caterpillars have prominent hairs that protrude, some in dense tufts, from colored tubercles along their body. Western tussock moth, Orgyia vetusta, hosts include fruit and nut trees, hawthorn, manzanita, oak, pyracantha, toyon, walnut, and willow. Mature caterpillars are gray and have numerous bright blue, red, and yellow spots from which gray to white hairs radiate. They have four dense white tufts of hair on the back, two black tufts on the head, and a black and a white tuft at the rear. Rusty tussock moth, O. antiqua, feeds on many different deciduous and evergreen plants. The adult male is a black, brownish, and gray moth with a whitish blotch and brown band on each forewing. The larvae have a black body with numerous gray to tan hairs. There are three projecting tufts of black hair, two in front and one at the rear, and four orangish to straw-colored tufts along the back. The Douglas-fir tussock moth, O. pseudotsugata, feeds primarily on Douglas-fir and true firs. Lighter-colored tufts of hair along the back, red spots on top, and an orange stripe along each side distinguish its mature larvae from those of the rusty tussock moth.",
        "life_cycle": "Tussock moths overwinter as eggs. The tiny, dark caterpillars hatch in spring and can use a silk strand and their body hairs to float on the wind to other trees. After feeding, mature larvae pupate on bark in a hairy, brown or tan cocoon. The emerging females produce pheromone to attract the night-flying males; females of some species are flightless. Adults occur from late spring through at least early summer. There are one or two generations per year, depending on the species and location. In southern California, western tussock moth may have two generations, with second-generation larvae present from about late August to October.",
        "damage": "Larvae chew foliage, giving plants a clipped or ragged appearance. Localized high numbers of larvae can completely defoliate trees. Otherwise healthy broadleaf plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Larvae may also take small bites out of young fruit, causing the damaged areas to later discolor or become scabby as fruit grow. Young larvae that migrate by floating on wind can be annoying when abundant. The larval hairs readily detach when touched, and can irritate human skin. The urticating setae, or hollow hairs, connect to poison sacs under the larval skin. Tussock moths generally do not warrant insecticide application unless plants are otherwise unhealthy or young. An exception is heavily infested conifers, which can be killed by a single defoliation.",
        "solutions": "Various predatory beetles and bugs and para\u00adsitic tachinid flies and wasps often help keep tussock moth populations at low levels. For example, a tiny, purplish-black scelionid wasp, Telenomus californicus, kills many western tussock moth eggs. A caterpillar-specific nucleopolyhedrosis virus can quickly reduce tussock moth populations, though often not until after trees have been extensively defoliated. When killed by the virus, larvae often hang limply from twigs. Removing egg masses, newly hatched caterpillars, and cocoons may provide some control on shrubs and small trees. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and clothing that well-covers skin. Definitely avoid inhaling any caterpillar parts. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) controls tussock moth larvae, especially if applied when most larvae are young. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. The somewhat-selective spinosad is also effective, but can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering.

They are usually elongate and segmented, and may have wax filaments radiating from the body, especially at the tail. Most females can move slowly and are covered with whitish, mealy or cottony wax. This waxy covering is similar to that produced by cottony cushion scales. Colonies occur as white, sticky clusters among leaves and fruit. Larvae are mobile. Mealybugs are often confused with woolly aphids.",
        "identification": "",
        "life_cycle": "Mealybugs overwinter as eggs or crawlers in protected places on the tree, such as crevices in the bark. The yellow to orange eggs are laid in a cottony mass called an ovisac. The young nymphs, or crawlers, are oblong, whitish, yellowish, or reddish and may or may not be covered with waxy filaments. In spring, crawlers move to the base of growing shoots or fruit clusters and stay until maturity (late May or June). As they mature, mealybugs become purple and develop a white powdery wax covering. Mature female mealybugs are about 3/16 inch long. Males are tiny two-winged insects that are rarely seen. Mature females return to protected places under the bark and lay eggs. Eggs also may be laid in the calyx end of the fruit such as apples. Eggs hatch in June, and the new generation of crawlers moves from the bark to tender shoots or fruit to feed with those hatched on the fruit. Adults of this generation move back to the bark in August or September and lay eggs for overwintering. Some of these eggs may hatch in the fall to produce crawlers that overwinter. Most mealybugs have several generations a year.",
        "damage": "Mealybugs tend to congregate in large numbers, forming white, cottony masses on plants. They feed on stems and leaves of fruit trees and ornamentals. High populations slow plant growth and cause premature leaf or fruit drop and twig dieback. Mealybugs can lower fruit quality by covering it with wax or sticky honeydew upon which black sooty mold grows.",
        "solutions": "Provide proper cultural control so that plants are vigorous and can tolerate moderate mealybug feeding without being damaged. Naturally occurring predators and parasites provide good control of many mealybug species, unless these beneficials are disrupted. Manage ants, which are attracted to honeydew and inhibit the activities of natural enemies. Removal of overwintering sites, such as loose bark, can reduce mealybug numbers. Populations often drop in summer. Mealybugs are difficult to control with insecticides and systemic materials may be required. On ornamentals, insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil, or a forceful stream of water can be applied to reduce exposed populations with minimal harm to natural enemies that may migrate in later. Mealybugs are sensitive to heat and their waxy coat protects them from insecticides. Treatments are usually not justified or effective on home fruit trees.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/waleuroprdmite.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This spider mite (family Tetranychidae) is especially common on apple. It is occasionally abundant on Prunus species (e.g., almond and stone fruits), and walnut. It can occur on about 150 plant species including ash, black locust, elm, and rose, but it generally is not damaging to these other hosts. ",
        "identification": "Immatures of European red mite are red, except just after molting when they are bright green. The green color turns to red after the mites resume feeding. Adults are dark red and have a white spot at the base of each of six to eight hairs on the back. Eggs are globular and red with many grooves extending from top to bottom. They have a slender stalk rising from the top center. Eggs resemble those of citrus red mite (Panonychus citri), except European red mite eggs lack the 10 to 12 threads radiating from the tip of the stalk to the leaf surface that occur on eggs of citrus red mite. Similar-looking mites found in gardens and landscapes include southern red mite (Oligonychus ilicis), which can be common on broadleaf evergreens such as azalea, camellia, holly, and rhododendron. The similar citrus red mite occurs on many plants but is a pest only on citrus.",
        "life_cycle": "European red mite develops through five life stages: egg, six-legged larva, and eight-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The mite overwinters as eggs on roughened bark at the base of buds and spurs on smaller branches and twigs or in bark wounds. During the growing season, eggs are laid on leaves. Overwintering eggs are laid as early as August and as late as October and November, varying with the weather. Overwintered eggs hatch in late winter or spring when hosts blossom. The immature mites migrate to leaves and feed on young foliage. Especially early in the season, European red mites are mostly found on the undersurface of leaves. Low temperatures in spring can prevent high populations from developing. European red mite can complete 1 generation in less than 3 weeks when temperatures are warm. It can have 5 to 10 generations per year.",
        "damage": "European red mite generally is damaging only on apples and less often on Prunus species. The mites' sucking feeding causes leaves to lighten in color, becoming whitish, mottled, or stippled. Prolonged feeding by heavy populations eventually causes leaf bronzing or burning and sometimes premature drop of leaves, which can result in sunburned fruit and reduced yield the following growing season.",
        "solutions": "Keep host plants adequately irrigated during warm weather to reduce the likelihood of a spider mite problem. Predators of mites generally keep European red mite abundance below damaging levels if the natural enemies are not disrupted, such as by pesticide application. Western predatory mite and other predatory mites, such as Phytoseiulus persimilis, are the most important predators of European red mite. Green lacewings, spider mite destroyer (a tiny, black lady beetle, or ladybug), and sixspotted thrips are also important mite predators. To improve the effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small plants), and avoid the application of miticides and broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides for all pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. Insecticide application during the growing season is generally not necessary or advisable for European red mite. An exception can be on apple where horticultural (narrow-range) oil spray may be warranted during the delayed dormant period (when buds are swollen but not yet burst open); this time is just as the mite eggs are about to hatch. If the mites are excessively abundant during the growing season, wait and make an oil application when buds swell in late winter or spring. For more information, see Pest Notes: Spider Mites.

Immediately after hatching, a caterpillar eats a smooth round hole in the leaf and crawls through to the lower surface, where it continues to eat. Caterpillars feed on grape leaves for about 25 days. They then make their way to the ground and construct a smooth-walled cell in which to overwinter as pupae. First-generation moths emerge during the first half of May. A second brood of moths, much more numerous than the first, appears in early July and the greatest damage is done in August. A generation is completed in about 55 days, and in some years there are three generations.",

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/spottedwing.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Larvae of the spotted wing drosophila (SWD, Drosophilidae) feed in cherries throughout the state and in blueberries and occasionally caneberries and strawberries mostly in coastal areas. The legless, whitish larvae at maturity, and the cylindrical, brown to yellow pupae, are about 1/8 inch long. Adults are flies about 1/10 inch long with red eyes and a brown thorax. The female's egg laying creates a small puncture in a depression on the fruit surface. Male D. suzukii can be distinguished from most other Drosophila spp. by the dark spot near the tip of each of their two wings. Other similar-looking Drosophila spp. vinegar flies, or common fruit flies, mostly feed in fermenting, injured, or overripe fruit. Larvae of true fruit flies (Tephritidae) also feed in the pulp of fruits and certain other crops. Pest tephritid flies in California include apple maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella), olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae), and walnut husk fly (Rhagoletis completa). Adult tephritids and mature larvae (pale maggots) are about 1/4 inch long, considerably larger than the spotted wing drosophila and other vinegar flies. Exotic tephritids such as the Mediterranean, Mexican, and Oriental fruit flies are periodically introduced and have apparently been eradicated. Take any tephritid flies or maggots you find in fruit to the county agricultural commissioner or your local UC ANR Cooperative Extension office for identification unless you are confident the species found is already known to be established in California. Spotted wing drosophila adult females lay eggs in fruit just as it begins to develop its mature color. One to several larvae feed in each fruit, causing it to soften and become decayed. After maturing, the larvae partially or completely exit the fruit to pupate. There may be up to 10 generations per year. Spotted wing drosophila attacks healthy ripening fruit and damaged or split fruit. The female's ovipositor creates a small puncture in a depression on the fruit surface. Maggots feeding inside the fruit cause the flesh to turn brown and soft. Fruit may decay from secondary fungal and bacterial pathogens and drop. Traps help detect the presence of spotted wing drosophila. If trapping identifies that SWD is present, or you had this problem last year, insecticide can be applied. Removing and destroying infested fruit and fruit on the ground may help to reduce infestation of later-maturing varieties. Fine netting \u22640.98 mm mesh (e.g., made for no-seeums) placed over hosts before fruit begins to color or ripen may help to reduce infestation if it is well secured to exclude the flies. Spotted wing drosophila can be controlled by applications of spinosad, if the sprays are well timed. Monitor fruit and make the first application when fruit begin to change to their mature color. Because some varieties ripen early, others late, and more than one variety may be grown together, the total number of applications depends on what varieties are grown and temperature. In cherries, make the first application as fruit turns from yellowish to pink (about 2 to 3 weeks before harvest). Spray each variety at least a second time 7 to 10 days later, the shorter interval if temperatures have been warm and longer when it's been cool. In blueberries, apply an insecticide when the first berries begin to turn from green to pink. Make a second application prior to harvest. Treatments may be warranted at 7- to 14-day intervals until harvest is over. Pest Notes: Spotted Wing Drosophila",

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/sowbugs.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Pillbugs (family Armadillididae) and sowbugs (family Porcellionidae) are not insects or true bugs. They are soil-dwelling crustaceans in the order Isopoda (called isopods). They feed primarily on decaying plant material and occur mostly hidden under organic litter or other debris on the ground and beneath low-growing plant parts. They also chew fruit, succulent plant parts, seedlings, and vegetables that touch damp soil. Pillbugs and sowbugs are distinguished from insects and other many-legged creatures by the adults having seven pairs of legs. Adult pillbugs and sowbugs have a small head and six small abdominal segments. They have seven relatively large thoracic segments, each having a pair of legs. Adult insects (and often immatures) on the other hand have three pairs of legs, while centipedes and millipedes have many more pairs of legs. Pillbugs and sowbugs have a hard, shell-like covering that is made up of a series of segmented plates, a significant difference from the body segments of insects. The body of pillbugs and sowbugs are oblong to oval shaped with an arched or half-domed (convex) back. The top of sowbugs is more flattened in comparison with pillbugs. The adult body of both isopod types is about 1/3 to 3/4 inch long with antennae that are about one-quarter the body length. The young (immatures) are pale yellow to whitish and about 1/12 inch long when they emerge from their mother's brood sac. Older individuals are brown to dark gray but may be blue or purplish if recently molted. Males and females can be distinguished by examining their underside. Males have copulatory organs on the front underside of the thorax. Females lack these appendages and have a pouch on their underside through which when pregnant can be seen eggs or internally hatched young. When disturbed, pillbugs commonly curl into a ball resembling a pill, hence their common name. Sowbugs cannot roll into a ball and commonly scurry away when disturbed. Pillbugs have a smooth rounded rear end. In comparison, sowbugs have distinct appendages protruding from their rear. Eggs are retained in a brood sac on the underside of females. Eggs hatch about 1 month after being produced and the young remain in the brood sac for about 2 weeks before they emerge. The young pillbugs and sowbugs molt (shed their covering and grow a newer, larger covering) about every 1 to 2 weeks over a several month period as they grow into adults. Adults can live for 2 to 5 years. Sowbugs and pillbugs feed primarily on decaying plant material and are important decomposers of organic matter. However, they occasionally feed on seedlings, new roots, lower leaves, and fruits or vegetables touching the soil. They sometimes come indoors, which can be nuisance. If pillbugs or sowbugs are a problem, reduce the amount of decaying organic matter on soil and minimize wetness of the soil surface. Reduce the frequency of irrigation to the extent compatible with healthy plant growth. Irrigate early in the day so surfaces are drier by evening. Keep compost and mulch back from plants and building foundations. Using raised beds or planting boxes, plastic mulch instead of organic material, and drip or furrow irrigation instead of sprinklers usually keeps pillbugs and sowbugs from becoming serious problems. Black plastic mulch may be more effective at discouraging them than white or clear plastic. Ways to stop these invertebrates from coming inside: Install weather stripping and door sweeps (bottom barriers). Keep irrigation water back from foundations especially near entranceways. Modify or reduce habitat around buildings that favors invaders, such as keep plants, mulch and other debris, and other hiding places at least several inches back from foundations and even further back from entranceways. Reduce outside lights\u2019 attraction of invertebrates. For example, reduce brightness, switch to motion-activated security lights instead of always-on lights at night, and experiment with yellow or other-colored lighting. Seal or screen gaps and openings in buildings.

        "description": "This spider mite (family Tetranychidae) is a sporadic pest of avocado and also damages plumeria in California. It is a minor pest of citrus in some growing areas and can occur on various other plants. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants.",
        "identification": "To locate this mite and its damage, use a hand lens to examine along the lateral veins and midrib on the underside of interior canopy leaves. Look for brown to purplish discoloration, mite webbing, and the mites. The oval body of sixspotted mite is lemon yellow, commonly with 2 to 6 dark spots on the abdomen. Some individuals have no distinct spots. Numerous fine bristles cover the body and legs. Adult females are 1/60 inch (0.42 mm) long and immatures are smaller. In comparison with adult females, males are smaller, thinner, and tapered toward the rear. The tiny eggs are globular and pale greenish yellow, pearly white, or translucent. Eggs have a slender stalk (stipe) projecting from the top. Tiny threads are commonly attached from the tip of the stalk down to the leaf surface. Early in the growing season the foliage damage of sixspotted mite can be confused with damage from persea mite and the mites have similar appearance. However, persea mite forms denser webbing and in individual circular patches, and its feeding discoloration occurs as scattered roundish spots. The silk of sixspotted mite is less dense and when abundant, discoloration damage can be nearly continuous along leaf veins. ",
        "life_cycle": "Sixspotted mite develops through 5 life stages: egg, 6-legged larva, and 8-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. Adult females lay about 25 to 40 eggs during their 10- to 20-day life span. Eggs hatch in 5 days to 3 weeks, the quicker at warmer temperatures. The abundance of sixspotted mite on avocado is highest during spring and early summer. When temperatures are warm, egg to adult development is about 10 days. There are multiple generations per year.",
        "damage": "Sixspotted mite sucks and feeds on only the lower surface of avocado leaves. It causes irregular brown to purplish discoloration, mostly along the midrib and larger veins. Sixspotted mite produces webbing, but not the dense silk patches formed by persea mite. Sixspotted spider mite feeding can severely stress trees at relatively low densities by causing premature leaf drop. However, mite abundance usually remains at two to three mites or fewer per leaf and at this low abundance sixspotted mite is not damaging and is easily overlooked. Sixspotted mites are generally under good biological control in avocados and citrus in the interior growing areas (e.g., Riverside and San Diego counties) due to predators and warm weather. Locations near the coast, such as foggy areas in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties, are more likely to experience damage. Sixspotted mite can become a problem anywhere if the trees are covered with dust or drought stressed or if a broad-spectrum insecticide or miticide used to control other pests disrupts the natural biological control of spider mites.",
        "solutions": "Provide trees with the appropriate amount and frequency of irrigation during the dry season to reduce the likelihood of a mite outbreak and increase trees' tolerance to their feeding. Avoid or minimize fertilization of trees, especially with quick release nitrogen formulations, because excessive nitrogen in leaves can increase mite abundance. Predaceous mites, especially Amblyseius (=Typhlodromalus) limonicus, Euseius hibisci, Galendromus helveolus, and Typhlodromus rickeri are the most important natural enemies of sixspotted mite. They commonly prevent this pest from becoming a problem. The spider mite destroyer (a tiny, black lady beetle), and sixspotted thrips are also important predators of sixspotted mite. Other natural enemies as discussed in the \"Solutions\" section of Persea Mite can also feed on sixspotted mite. To improve the effectiveness of naturally occurring mite predators, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. A low abundance of this mite can be tolerated. If sixspotted mite or other mites are unacceptably abundant, horticultural (narrow-range) oil or wettable sulfur can be sprayed on foliage. Thoroughly cover the lower surface of leaves where both persea mite and sixspotted mite occur. Do not apply sulfur and oil within 2 months of each other or foliage may be damaged by the pesticides.

        "description": "This bark beetle (subfamily Scolytinae) attacks the limbs and trunks of various woody broadleaf plants. Common hosts include apple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, and Prunus species, such as English laurel and stone fruit trees. Clear to brownish sap exuding from holes in bark about 1/16 inch (1.5 mm) in diameter is commonly the first-observed sign that a tree is being attacked (bored into) by adult shothole borers or other Scolytinae. When a tree is successfully attacked and borer larvae and pupae develop under bark, the new generation of adult borers that emerges will leave numerous small holes in bark that are dry without any exuding sap. Adults are blackish to dark brown, oblong, hard-bodied insects about 1/10 inch (2.5 mm) long, somewhat larger than most species of bark beetle. The tiny eggs, larvae, and pupae are pale yellowish to white. Larvae are legless, whitish grubs with a brown head. Larvae and pupae are about 1/10 inch long or less. They occur hidden in tunnels under bark that are partly packed with the beetle's brown frass (excrement). Bark beetles develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The mated adult female bores through bark into the cambium of plant hosts and lays eggs along a tunnel she chews. The emerging larvae grow through four, increasingly larger instars as they feed and chew winding tunnels under bark. Mature larvae pupate under bark then emerge as a new generation of adults. Shothole borer overwinters as mature larvae (prepupae) under bark. In spring shothole borers pupate, emerge as adults, then mate and the females seek hosts. Shothole borers can have several generations per year. The shothole borer attacks and reproduces in trees weakened by insufficient soil moisture, root diseases, sunburn, or other stressful growing conditions. Adults boring into trees cause hosts to exude copious sap. If trees are sufficiently healthy and adequately irrigated, the tree's sap may kill and repel the attacking beetles and the tree may survive. If beetles overcome the tree's defensive response and lay eggs, as the larvae hatch and feed under bark, the vascular system of limbs or trunks become girdled. This causes fading of leaf color and foliage wilting. Limbs or the entire tree can be killed. Adults also chew and feed at the base of small twigs, which may be killed. But this damage is not commonly noticed unless large numbers of adults are present. Most of the damage is done by the larvae feeding between the bark and wood. Holes in bark made by beetles boring into trees or emerging give the appearance of a BB- or shot-gun blast, leaving \"shot holes\" for which the species is named. Prevent sunburn of newly planted or heavily pruned trees. This can be accomplished by whitewashing (painting) trunks with white, interior latex paint diluted with an equal amount of water. Provide trees with a good growing environment and optimal cultural care to reduce their susceptibility to wood borers. Appropriate irrigation is especially important as drought stress greatly predisposes trees to attack by various boring insects. Providing adequate soil moisture promptly after a drought-stressed tree is first attacked may help the tree to survive. Prune to eliminate limbs infested with shothole borers if this can be done without removing a large portion of a tree's wood. Remove dying and severely infested trees before the beetle larvae mature and emerge as adults that can move to attack other hosts. Chip all wood or haul it to the landfill before the growing season starts. Do not leave pruned limbs or stumps (e.g., firewood piles) near hosts as shothole borers can emerge from cut wood before it dries and attack nearby hosts.

The mites are carrot or wedge shaped and pale brown to translucent whitish. Adults are about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long. A dissecting binocular microscope or a hand lens of 20\u00d7 is needed to see them. Deutonymphs (first-stage immatures) are about one-half the length of adults. Protonymphs (older immatures) are about the same length as adults. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the head (wider) end of their body. The oval eggs are translucent to white and about one-fourth the length of adults.",
        "life_cycle": "Redberry mite develops through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. It overwinters in buds and on bark of axils, where a bud and twig bark touch. In late winter and spring when flower buds swell, the mites become active. They feed in buds and (when present) drupelet bases near the berry core and stem. Development from an egg to a reproductive adult can be completed in about 2 weeks when temperatures are warm. There are multiple generations per year.",
        "damage": "The redberry mite is primarily a pest of blackberry, but also feeds on raspberry. Ripening blackberry drupelets fed upon by redberry mites do not darken in color. They become brighter red, hardened, and sour and remain on old canes through winter. All or only part of the berry may be affected. Dryberry mite causes similar damage to both blackberry and raspberry. ",
        "solutions": "Tolerate or prune out and destroy infested fruit. Where redberry mite has been a perennial problem, consider replacing blackberries with less-susceptible varieties, such as those that mature earlier in the season. Evergreen and Himalaya varieties are most susceptible to redberry mites. By the time fruit damage becomes apparent, it is too late to control the mite. Where redberry mite was an intolerable problem the previous growing season, spray micronized or wettable sulfur on buds and terminals at the delayed-dormant stage, after buds swell but before they open. Application can be repeated at bloom or when shoots are 2 to 6 inches long. Sulfur application also helps control powdery mildew. Several applications of azadirachtin, narrow-range or horticultural oil, or neem oil at 2 to 3 week intervals can be made at the green fruit stage through when pink fruit appear. Do not apply oil within 1 month before or after a sulfur application and vice versa or plants may be damaged.

Predatory mites have longer legs and are more active than are the plant-feeding mites. They move much faster and lack the dark spots of spider mites. You can purchase and release predatory mites to establish populations, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators--for instance, by avoiding dusty conditions and pesticide sprays. Predator mites do not feed on foliage or become pests, so must be released when pest mites are available. To establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray to bring pests to a lower level and then release predators. A good rule of thumb is that one predator is needed for every ten spider mites to provide control. Concentrate releases where spider mite numbers are highest. Once established on perennials, predatory mites may reproduce and provide biological control indefinitely without further augmentation unless nonselective insecticides are applied. ",

        "description": "This spider mite (family Tetranychidae) is a common pest of avocado. It can occur on more than one dozen other plants, but generally is a pest only on avocado.",
        "identification": "When persea mites are abundant, infestation can be recognized by the numerous brown-spotted, green leaves hanging from the tree and dropped prematurely on the ground. When viewed from a distance, the canopy of a heavily infested tree can appear lighter-colored overall than that of a healthy tree. Persea mite feeds mostly beneath roundish patches of silk that resemble a silvery blotch on the underside of leaves. The mite colonies are small and can be very numerous. Their feeding causes discrete, circular, brown to yellowish spots that initially are visible only on the lower surface of leaves. These spots later become visible on the upper leaf surface. Adult females are about 1/50 inch (0.5 mm) long and have an oval-shaped body that is slightly flattened and elongated. Females and immatures are greenish or yellowish with two or more dark blotches on the abdomen. Old females that have ceased egg laying turn darker green and become somewhat smaller and inactive. Males are smaller than reproductive females, somewhat pear-shaped, slightly flattened, and yellowish with or without dark spots. Eggs are round and pale yellow. They develop red eye spots as they approach hatching. Persea mite damage early in the growing season can be confused with damage from sixspotted mite, Eotetranychus sexmaculatus. Both mites feed mostly or only on the underside of leaves. Sixspotted mite webbing is less dense and usually does not occur in small, circular patches. Sixspotted mite feeding on avocado causes brown to purplish, irregularly shaped blotches that are often relatively contiguous along the veins, in comparison to the roundish, mostly scattered spots created by persea mite. There are six dark spots on the yellowish body of sixspotted mite. Its round eggs are translucent to white. See Pest Notes: Sixspotted Spider Mite on Plumeria for more information on this pest. Mite feeding on the upper leaf surface is generally caused by avocado brown mite, Oligonychus punicae. Avocado brown mite feeding causes the upper leaf surface to appear bronzed (brown) and the damage does not appear in discrete, circular spots as with persea mite. Avocado brown mite is brown to dark colored and unlike persea mite produces little obvious silk. Its tiny eggs are amber or honey colored with a short projecting stalk. Eggs occur mostly singly along the upper surface of the midrib vein.",
        "life_cycle": "Persea mite develops through 5 life stages: egg, 6-legged larva, and 8-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. During her life each adult female lays about 2 to 4 dozen eggs beneath silk. When occupied, these silk-covered \u201cnests\u201d typically contain eggs, immatures (larvae and nymphs), and adults. Development time from the egg to a reproductive adult is about 2 to 3 weeks when temperatures average 70\u00b0F. There are multiple generations per year. Heavy winter rains and wind can reduce persea mite abundance and subsequent damage. Cool winter temperatures slow persea mite population growth. Mite densities are lowest in March and gradually increase through spring while feeding on new leaf flush. Populations generally peak in July and August. Persea mite abundance is suppressed and may decline rapidly when humidity is low and the temperature reaches 100\u00b0F or higher on several consecutive days.",
        "damage": "Persea mites' sucking and feeding on the underside of leaves causes circular, yellowish leaf spots that turn brown. Each mite colony produces dense webbing that resembles a silvery spot on the underside of the leaf. Feeding by abundant mites causes premature leaf drop, which can contribute to sunburn of fruit and during the next growing season reduced fruit yield. But in residential avocados, persea mites can commonly be tolerated. Persea mite is most damaging to Hass and Gwen avocados and a few other varieties. Esther, Pinkerton, and Reed are of intermediate susceptibility. The Bacon, Fuerte, Lamb Hass, and Zutano varieties are much less susceptible. Persea mite attacks numerous other plant species, but is an uncommon pest on them. Alternative hosts include acacia, bamboo, carob, eucalyptus, grape, Prunus species, rose, and willow. Weed hosts include cheeseweeds (mallows), lambsquarters, milkweed, and sowthistle.",
        "solutions": "Cultural controls, mite predators, and application of an acaricide (miticide) are the main controls for persea mite. Eliminate or reduce alternative host plants for persea mite that are growing near your avocado, such as weeds. Provide trees with appropriate irrigation and other good cultural care to maintain the flush of new growth and compensate for mite-induced leaf drop. Avoid fertilizing avocado where mites have been a problem. Excessive fertilization, especially with quick-release nitrogen formulations, can increase persea mite populations and their damage during late spring and summer. Minimize tree stress to reduce the effect of persea mites feeding on trees. Appropriate irrigation frequency and amounts, good management of avocado root rot and other key pathogens, and early harvesting of fruit will reduce the adverse impacts of mite feeding. If abundant mites cause extensive leaf drop, protect bark and wood from sunburn by whitewashing (painting) major limbs and trunks with white, interior latex paint diluted with an equal amount of water. Mites have numerous natural enemies, but they are not highly effective because of persea mites\u2019 protective, webbed nests. However, conserving natural enemies can reduce persea mite abundance mostly when the mites are moving outside of their nests. Predators commonly provide good biological control of avocado brown mite and sixspotted mite. Predaceous mites include Neoseiulus (=Amblyseius) californicus, Euseius hibisci, Galendromus annectens, and G. helveolus. Black hunter thrips, brown lacewings, dustywings, green lacewings, spider mite destroyer (a tiny, black lady beetle), and sixspotted thrips are also important mite predators. Predaceous mite midges (Feltiella species) and a rove beetle (Oligota oviformis) also prey on persea mite in coastal areas. Releases of Galendromus species predaceous mites before persea mites become abundant has provided control in commercial avocado orchards. To check the viability of purchased predaceous mites, gently pour some mites and any shipping substrate into a clear jar and look for an abundance of fast-moving mites, which would indicate that the predators have arrived in good condition. To improve the effectiveness of naturally occurring mite predators and any that are released, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small plants), and avoid the application of miticides and broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides for all pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators and Natural Enemy Releases for Biological Control of Crop Pests for more suggestions. Spraying the underside of leaves with a forceful stream of water can reduce mite populations on a few small trees where this is feasible. If mites become too abundant, horticultural (narrow-range) oil can be sprayed on foliage. Be sure to thoroughly cover the underside of leaves where persea mites occur.

        "description": "Pear sawfly (Tenthredinidae) is a wasp (Hymenoptera) named for the females' jagged (sawtoothed), egg-laying organ. The larvae chew foliage of cherry, pear, and occasionally other Rosaceae.",
        "identification": "Adult pear sawflies are about 1/5 inch long and glossy black overall with yellow. They have two pairs of wings with prominent veins and a broad waist, unlike the narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax of most wasps. Larvae are whitish to yellow with a yellowish-brown head when they are newly hatched, recently molted, or mature (prepupae). After molting as they begin to feed, larvae exude a gelatinous, olive-green coating that obscures the body surface and gives them the appearance of a slug (shell-less mollusk). Larvae grow to about 3/8 inch long. The thorax, three segments immediately behind the head, is wider than the rest of the body. The California pear sawfly, Pristiphora abbreviata, also feeds on pear; its larvae are bright green and lack an olive-green coating. In addition to three pairs of true legs behind the head (obscured by the body coating), pear sawfly larvae have prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two to eight (seven pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage have five or fewer pairs of prolegs.",
        "life_cycle": "Pear sawflies overwinter as inactive, mature larvae (prepupae) in cells they form in topsoil. In early spring, they pupate and emerge as adults and mate. Females insert tiny eggs in the underside of host leaves. Larvae soon hatch and feed and develop through five, increasingly larger instars (growth stages). At maturity, they drop to the ground, move into topsoil, and form a pupation cell. There generally are two generations per year in California. Larvae are most abundant in mid to late spring and mid to late summer. Feeding by the second-generation larvae during summer causes most of the foliage damage.",
        "damage": "Larvae chew and skeletonize cherry and pear foliage and also feed on cotoneaster, hawthorn, mountain ash, plum, and quince. They feed on the upper side of leaves, chewing surface tissue except for the veins and causing brownish to gray patches in foliage. Pear sawfly and its damage in California occur mostly in coastal and northern areas. Feeding by high numbers of larvae may reduce fruit size that season and result in fewer or smaller fruit or both the following season. Pear sawfly feeding does not seriously threaten the survival of otherwise-healthy plants.",
        "solutions": "Pear sawfly is often controlled by natural enemies. When limited in numbers, pick the pearslugs (cherryslugs) off by hand or dislodge them from foliage with a forceful stream of water. Larvae are relatively easy to control if thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, neem oil, insecticidal soap, and spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) does not control sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, which are the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/pearrustmite.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "Feeding by this rust mite (family Eriophyidae) causes brownish discoloration on pear fruit and leaves. On apple, only leaves are fed on and discolored. Adults and nymphs of pear rust mites are wedge shaped with the head and two pairs of legs at the wider end. These tiny mites are 1/120 inch or less in length so you need at least a 20X hand lens to see them. They are more easily seen using a binocular microscope with good lighting. The tiny eggs are spherical, nearly clear when first laid, and become pale-straw colored before hatching. These mites are often not noticed until their feeding damage appears and the cause is investigated. When overwintering on bark and buds, the mites are brown to reddish. During the growing season when they feed, they are cream-colored to whitish. Darkened foliage can also be caused by the feeding of spider mites. In comparison with rust mites, spider mites are rounder and larger. Spider mites commonly have two dark spots and often produce webbing. Rust mites leave no webbing on plants. Eriophyid mites develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The mite overwinters as adult females beneath bud scales and on young bark, predominantly on branches 2 to 4 years old. As buds open in spring, the mites become active and adult females soon begin laying eggs. After hatching, immature mites grow rapidly through two instars. In apples the mites feed primarily on the surface of leaves. In pears they move to developing leaf clusters and feed within buds. As pear leaves mature and harden, pear rust mites move either to young succulent leaf tissue or to fruit. Soon after petal fall, aesthetically damaging populations may develop around the calyx or stem end or both of pear fruit. The russeting on the fruit becomes visible around late May or June, when pears have increased in size and turned down. By late summer, only females are present, and they seek overwintering sites under scales of newly developed pear tissues. If tender foliage remains present, the females may remain active and feeding on leaves into November. Several generations occur each growing season. Pear rust mites feed on the surface of apple and pear foliage and on pear fruit, causing a browning of the tissue. Injury to leaves if abundant may stunt the growth of young trees. If these mites are abundant and uncontrolled, the feeding and russeting may spread over the entire fruit, marring fruit appearance. Internal fruit quality is not affected. The intensity of russeting is determined by the number of mites and the length of their feeding period. Pear rust mite is commonly not detected until tissues grow and expand, which is after the feeding damage has occurred. In backyard fruit trees natural enemies can keep pear rust mites under fairly good control. To conserve predators of mites, avoid the application of residual (persistent), broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides for all pests, including carbamates (carbaryl), organophosphates (e.g., malathion) and pyrethroids (\"-thrin\" insecticides e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin). Control ants and reduce dustiness, such as by hosing off foliage of small trees. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Aesthetic damage to fruit surfaces generally does not justify treatment in backyard trees. If treatment is desired, best control is achieved with a fall application of micronized sulfur, or during the dormant season (after November 1) sulfur plus horticultural or narrow-range oil. To avoid plant damage, do not spray oil on trees that were drought-stressed during late summer or fall. An Illustrated Guide to Plant Abnormalities Caused by Eriophyid Mites in North America",

        "description": "This eriophyid mite (family Eriophyidae) feeds on pears, causing discolored fruit and leaves, distorted fruit, and reduced fruit yield. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants. ",
        "identification": "Because eriophyids are microscopic, plant injury from their feeding as described below under \"Damage\" is what indicates these mites are present. Although with magnification the mites can be observed wandering across plant surfaces, they mostly occur hidden within buds and blistered tissue on the underside of leaves. The carrot-shaped or wormlike mites are pale yellow to pinkish or whitish. The body is striated and has a few long hairs. Adults are about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long. A dissecting binocular microscope or a hand lens of at least 20\u00d7 is needed to see them. Deutonymphs (first-stage immatures) are about one-half the length of adults. Protonymphs (second-stage immatures) are about the same length as adults. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the head (wider) end of their body. The oval eggs are translucent to white and about one-fourth the length of adults.",
        "life_cycle": "Pearleaf blister mite develops through four life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The mites overwinter beneath the scales of fruit and leaf buds and are generally most abundant in terminal buds. They can feed throughout winter and cause infested buds to drop. When buds remain viable and open in the spring, the mites feed on leaves and around blossoms. Infested leaves develop blisters where the mites feed on the underside. Most blister development occurs in spring. Adult females lay eggs in the blisters and the hatching mites feed within the injured tissue. Each female lays about 1 to 2 dozen eggs during her life span. Mites move in and out of a blister through a small hole in its raised center. At maturity the adult mites commonly leave a blister and move to new locations to feed, causing development of more leaf blisters. The mites develop through several generations on leaves. Before leaf drop in fall, the mites leave the blisters and migrate to buds to overwinter. Development from egg to reproductive adult occurs in 10 to 30 days, the quicker at warmer temperatures. Pearleaf blister mite has several generations per year",
        "damage": "Mites feeding during winter can cause infested buds to blacken, become dry, and drop before spring. During the growing season, mite feeding on the underside of leaves causes swollen blisters on the upper leaf surface. Blisters are initially pale green, pinkish, or reddish but may darken to black or dark brown by the end of the growing season. Feeding in fruit blossoms can kill them, causing a reduction in fruit yield. Fruit that develops can be misshapen and commonly develops brown, scabby scars (russeting) on the skin. Pears with naturally russeted surfaces (e.g., Bosc, Hardy, Nelis, and Winter) generally do not show the scabby damage of pearleaf blister mite.",
        "solutions": "In residential fruit trees, natural enemies may keep pearleaf blister mites under adequate biological control. The most important natural enemies are predaceous mites, such as Phytoseiulus species and western predatory mite. Various predatory insects are also important, especially the spider mite destroyer (a tiny black lady beetle) and sixspotted thrips. To improve the effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dust (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all pear pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. If mite damage has been common and intolerable, make an application of azadirachtin, narrow-range or horticultural oil, or neem oil after harvest during late October or November. Make sure soil has adequate moisture for roots before spraying oil; irrigate before applying oil if fall rainfall has been low. Thoroughly drench shoot terminals with spray to obtain adequate control. Alternatively spray micronized or wettable sulfur on buds and terminals at the delayed-dormant stage, after buds swell but before most have opened. Sulfur can also be applied during November. Do not apply sulfur within 1 month before or after applying oil and vice versa or plant damage may occur. Once fruit is set in spring, the damage has already occurred and will become apparent as fruit and leaves grow. Spraying trees can only prevent or reduce damage the following growing season.

The actual level of parasitization is highest, however, when leafminer populations are low. Female parasites usually lay their eggs in the leaf mine formed at the beginning of the tissue-feeding stage. After hatching, parasitic larvae generally attach themselves to the outside of fourth- or fifth-instar leafminers. The parasite grows rapidly and consumes the leafminer by its fifth instar. It then pupates within the leaf mine, at about the same time as the leafminer would have. Although smaller than a leafminer pupa, the parasite pupa can be distinguished by its larger head and eyes and flattened body. Following pupation, the adult parasite cuts a hole in the leaf and emerges. Adult parasites are small but easy to spot when populations are abundant because they fly in groups that hover near infested trees. Adult parasites feed on the sap-feeding leafminers. ",

        "description": "At least 69 Chrysobothris species occur in California. Of these Pacific flatheaded borer is the most common. Adults of Chrysobothris flatheaded borers (family Buprestidae) are attracted to lay eggs on diseased or stressed trees and shrubs and wounds on woody limbs and trunks. Pacific flatheaded borer can infest dozens of broadleaved, fruit and nut trees and woody ornamentals. The adult is bullet shaped, hard bodied, and 1/2 to 3/4 inch long. It has a coppery, dark bronze, or gray body and wing covers with pale mottling. The circular, disklike egg is laid on bark and is white and about 1/25 inch in diameter. The pale yellow to whitish larva is legless. It has brown mouthparts and distinct segments and tapers toward the rear. The segment immediately behind the head (prothorax) is greatly enlarged. At maturity larvae are 3/5 to 3/4 inch long. The elongate, oval pupa is the length of adults and initially translucent white, then creamy white, then gradually takes on the color of adults. Mated females lay eggs in bark crevices and wounds, such as injury caused by pruning cuts, trunk stakes and ties, and sunburn or where the rootstock and scion are grafted together. Each adult female can lay about 100 eggs singly on the tree. The emerging larvae chew into bark and feed and tunnel in cambium. As larvae grow they may bore deeper into wood. Mature larvae (prepupae) overwinter under bark then pupate in spring. In mild-winter locations the beetle may be active throughout the year. Adults mostly emerge and fly from April through August, especially during June and July. There commonly is 1 generation per year. But in cooler locations more than 1 year can be required to complete 1 generation. Pacific flatheaded borer can infest at least 70 species of trees in 21 plant families. Wet spots and cracking on bark are usually the first damage symptoms observed. Bark then becomes increasingly roughened in areas where larvae are feeding underneath. Damaged bark commonly occurs in a winding pattern that corresponds to the larval tunneling. Granular frass (excrement) may become visible on bark, but most frass remains hidden packed in larval tunnels. After pupating the emerging adult leaves a round to D-shaped hole about 1/10 inch in diameter in bark and wood. Adults also chew twigs and the base of leaf petioles, but this injury is usually innocuous and easily overlooked. However, when adults are especially abundant their feeding can partially defoliate young trees. Larvae are preyed upon by larvae of predatory beetles and at least four species of parasitic wasps. In California the wasp Trigonura californica (family Chalcididae) is the most common parasite of Pacific flatheaded borer. Adults of this wasp are about 5/16 inch long and black with a covering of fine hairs that can give them a silvery appearance. The harvest (grain, or itch) mite, Pediculoides ventricosus, also commonly preys on the borer larvae. Woodpeckers commonly feed on the larvae, but their flaking off of bark to reach the prey increases injury to the tree. Prevention is the most effective method of managing flatheaded borers. Plant only species well adapted for the conditions at that location. Properly prepare the site, plant correctly, and protect roots and trunks from injuries. Whitewash trunks of newly planted and young trees by applying indoor, white latex paint diluted with an equal amount of water. Or wrap trunks with heavy paper to help prevent sunburned bark that attracts the egg laying females. If trunks are wrapped, periodically remove wrapping and inspect bark for injuries. Learn the cultural requirements of the plants present and provide proper care to keep them growing vigorously. Appropriate irrigation is particularly important as drought stress increases tree susceptibility to bark- and wood-boring insects. Prune out and dispose of borers restricted to a few limbs. Remove and dispose of dying trees to prevent boring insects from emerging and attacking other nearby trees. Do not pile unseasoned, freshly cut wood near woody plants as borers can continue to develop in cut wood and emerge to lay eggs on nearby hosts. Solarize recently cut wood to kill beetles infesting it. Seal wood beneath heavy clear plastic tarps in a sunny location for several months through the warm season; after this time, any emerged borers will have died and the dry wood will no longer be suitable for borers. Tightly seal the tarp edges (e.g., with soil) to prevent any insects from escaping. Instead of one large pile, use several smaller wood piles to promote quicker drying. Larvae can sometimes be killed by probing tunnels with a sharp wire. This method is practical only in a small infestation, and it is often difficult to know whether the wire has reached and killed the larva. Avoid further damaging bark when probing trunks. Especially valuable trees may be protected from further attack by an early May application of carbaryl or a pyrethroid to kill the egg laying adults. Products available to homeowners are not effective and a professional applicator must be hired to make the application. Consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company for guidance when selecting a company for hire. Unless trees are monitored regularly so that borer activity can be detected early, pesticide use is likely to be too late and ineffective. Do not substitute insecticide applications for proper cultural care. Most borers are attracted to trees that are already unhealthy from other causes and relying only on insecticide can allow trees to die from those other causes unless the growing environment and cultural practices are improved.

It feeds on many different plants including apple, avocado, caneberries, citrus, cole crops, coyote brush, geranium, grape, oak, pear, rose, stone fruits, strawberry, and willow.",
        "identification": "Adults are about 1/2 inch long and bell shaped at rest as is characteristic of tortricid moths. Adults are variably colored moths with forewings that have blackish to dark markings. Overall the moths are mostly brown, gray, orangish, or silverish. Eggs are oval, flattened, and cream colored. They overlap like fish scales as is typical of tortricids. Eggs are laid on smooth surfaces such as fruit and the upper surface of leaves. Larvae have a greenish, orangish, or straw-colored body, a brown or straw-colored head, and brown prothoracic shield (plate on top of the first segment behind the head). They grow up to 3/5 inch long and resemble larvae of omnivorous leafroller. However, on omnivorous leafroller the small tubercles (mounds) at the base of the bristles on the side and back are chalky white. The tubercles on orange tortrix can match the color of the rest of the body and are brown, greenish, orange, or yellow but not white. Pupae are oblong, orangish, and about 1/2 inch long. They are commonly found within webbed foliage. ",
        "life_cycle": "Orange tortrix develops through 4 life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The adult female moth lays about 50 to 150 eggs during her several week life span. The hatching larvae develop through 5 increasingly larger instars. As with other tortricids, larvae produce silk strands with which they web together leaves, fruit, or both. They then feed within the webbed shelter. When disturbed larvae commonly wriggle and drop suspended on a silken thread. Orange tortrix overwinters as larvae in protected places on the plant, including on alternative hosts such as weeds. It has 2 to 4 generations per year in coastal areas.",
        "damage": "Orange tortrix chews and feeds on numerous plants, some of which are listed above. For a complete list of the plants on which it feeds, see HOSTS - a Database of the World's Lepidopteran Host Plants and in the search boxes enter Argyrotaenia citrana. Early in the growing season, orange tortrix larvae primarily roll and chew young leaves. Once foliage hardens, later-generation larvae prefer to chew and feed on fruit, such as under the sepals of avocado and citrus. They can chew through the rind or skin of various fruits and cause holes where the surrounding flesh may become decayed. Damaged fruit may drop prematurely.",
        "solutions": "Many natural enemies feed on orange tortrix and can keep its abundance low when not disrupted by the application of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides. A braconid wasp (Apanteles aristoteliae), two ichneumonid wasps (Exochus nigripalpis and another Exochus species), and two tachinid flies (Actia interrupta and Nemorilla pyste) are the most common parasites of orange tortrix. Female wasps lay their eggs in tortrix larvae (caterpillars), while tachinid flies lay eggs externally, usually on or near the caterpillar\u2019s head. The parasite larvae feed inside and kill their host. Apanteles aristoteliae pupates in a white cocoon outside the killed caterpillar. Exochus pupates inside the dead caterpillar and leaves a round exit hole when the adult wasp emerges. Tachinids exit their dead host during its late larval or pupal stage, and each tachinid forms a dark reddish, oblong pupal case nearby. Predators of the caterpillars or moths include assassin bugs, larvae of brown lacewings, and spiders. Control ants, reduce dust (e.g., periodically hose off small plants), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum insecticides for all pests on avocado and citrus trees to increase the effectiveness of natural enemies. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more tips on conserving natural enemies. Remove weeds such as cheeseweed, filaree, and mustards that can host orange tortrix which move to infest nearby plants as adults. At the end of the growing season remove any old fruit and webbed debris on plants or the ground as these can allow this pest to overwinter. Where fruit have previously been damaged by caterpillars, inspect hosts for orange tortrix larvae and other caterpillars at about 7- to 10-day intervals in spring. Look for caterpillars, chewing damage, webbed plant parts, and evidence of parasitism. If only a few caterpillars are found these can be crushed or the infested plant parts clipped off and disposed of in the trash. However if the caterpillars appear diseased or parasitized as describe above, leave them in place for the natural enemies to mature and attack additional caterpillars. If caterpillars are abundant, Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad can be sprayed to thoroughly cover infested plant parts. Add horticultural oil to the spinosad to increase its efficacy persistence and also control moth eggs and certain other pests that are directly contacted by the spray. Avoid applying spinosad to plants in bloom because it is toxic to bees and certain natural enemies.

        "description": "The looper, or measuringworm (Geometridae), larvae chew leaves, shoots, and occasionally fruit and feed on several dozen plant species. Hosts include acacia, box elder, California buckeye, chestnut, elm, eucalyptus, fruit trees, ginkgo, magnolia, maple, pepper tree, and willow. Young omnivorous looper larvae are pale yellow caterpillars. Older larvae grow to about 2 inches long and are yellow to pale green or pink, with dark brown, black, or green lines along the sides and a gold-colored head. In addition to the three pairs of legs behind the head, omnivorous loopers have two pairs of prolegs (leglike appendages) near the rear on abdominal segments 6 and 10. This allows them to travel in the characteristic looping manner, pulling their rear forward as they arch up their back. Mature larvae form pearly white to brown pupae, usually in webbing between leaves. Adults are tan moths with a narrow, black band across the middle of the wing. The barrel-shaped, pale green to reddish brown eggs have a ring of tiny projections and occur in clusters on the underside of leaves. Larvae hatch from the eggs about 8 or 9 days after oviposition, leaving behind transparent shells. Mature larvae usually pupate in webbing between leaves. Pupation lasts 1 to 4 weeks. Adults (moths) are active at night. Populations increase with increasing temperatures in spring. Depending on temperature, egg-to-adult development takes 2 to 5 months. Omnivorous looper has four to five generations per year in warmer, inland locations and three generations per year in coastal areas. Omnivorous looper leaf damage is especially evident on terminal shoots. Young larvae chew the leaf surface, leaving a brown membrane. Older larvae chew entirely through edges of leaves or shoots or between leaves tied with silk, often leaving only the midrib and larger veins. Fruit damage can be caused by young or old larvae. If young fruit is fed on, it sometimes becomes misshapen. Chewing typically scars the fruit surface and may cause damaged fruit to drop. Conserve natural enemies that can biologically control omnivorous looper. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticides to plants. Omnivorous loopers thrive in more protected sites, so pruning and thinning canopies can substantially reduce caterpillar abundance and damage. Birds, predatory bugs, lacewing larvae, and spiders prey on the caterpillars. A granulosis virus often infects and kills larvae when they become abundant. Parasitic wasps, especially Trichogramma egg parasites and three larval parasites (Braconidae), are the most important natural enemies of omnivorous looper. Apanteles caberatae and Meteorus tersus feed as a single wasp larva inside a looper larva, then emerge to pupate near the caterpillar. Apanteles caberatae pupates in an elongated, whitish, silken cocoon attached to foliage near its dead host. Meteorus tersus pupates in a brown or yellowish, parchmentlike cocoon that sometimes hangs beneath leaves or twigs, suspended on a silken thread about 1 to 2 inches long. Habrobracon (=Bracon) xanthonotus females lay from one egg to several dozen whitish eggs on each caterpillar. The emerging larvae feed as pale greenish to yellow maggots attached to the looper. Controls include thoroughly spraying infested foliage with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Spraying spinosad is also effective, but can adversely affect certain natural enemies. Spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, so do not apply it to plants that are flowering.",

        "description": "Two insect parasites, Apanteles harrisinae and Ametadoria misella, attack western grapeleaf skeletonizer larvae. A. harrisinae is a parasitic wasp that attacks early larval instars and usually deposits three to nine eggs in a host. Fully grown parasite larvae emerge from the fully grown host larva immediately after it has spun its cocoon. The cocoons are spun within the cocoon of the host, surrounding the dead caterpillar. The parasitic fly, A. misella, prefers to attack fourth and fifth instars. Larviposition occurs during the middle of the day and larvae immediately penetrate the host. Little development occurs until the host larva turns into the pupal stage. The parasite larva then develops rapidly and soon kills the host pupa. Its puparium is always formed within the host cocoon.",

        "description": "Leafrollers are larvae (caterpillars) of certain moths (Tortricidae). They primarily chew foliage and often feed and pupate within leaves they curl and web with silk.",
        "identification": "Correctly identify the cause of damage before taking action. The biology and management of leafrollers differs from that of the other caterpillarlike larvae. Grasshoppers, katydids, leaf beetles, sawflies, walking stick insects, weevils, and certain other insects can cause damage resembling caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. About 100 species of leafrollers occur in California. Pests of fruit and nut trees and various ornamental include fruittree leafroller, light brown apple moth, obliquebanded leafroller, and omnivorous leafroller. Adults and larvae of many species are similar looking and for positive identification must be submitted to an expert. Distinguishing leafroller species may be possible based on differences in body color and markings. Adults (moths) of most leafroller species are a mottled mix of colors and at rest appear bell shaped when viewed from above. Larvae have pairs of leglike appendages (prolegs) on abdominal segments 3 through 6 and the last (rear) segment. When disturbed, larvae wriggle vigorously and often drop suspended on on a silk thread.",
        "life_cycle": "Larvae develop through five or six increasingly larger instars (immature growth stages). Older caterpillars construct a new leafroll nest frequently, often daily, eventually pupating inside a nest or on bark in a thin, silken cocoon. Adult females lay eggs overlapping in flat masses resembling fish scales on leaves and limbs. The fruittree leafroller has only one generation per year, and the larvae are present only during spring; it overwinters as eggs on bark. Most other leafroller species have two or more generations per year, and can be present as larvae throughout the growing season; they overwinter in protected places, primarily as larvae or prepupae (inactive, mature larvae).",
        "damage": "Leafroller feeding gives foliage a ragged or curled appearance. Larvae prefer leaves but sometimes chew blossoms, fruits, and nuts, causing them to drop or become distorted or scarred. Unusually high populations can completely defoliate trees, and the leafroller's silken threads can entirely cover the plant.",
        "solutions": "For the major pests, species-specific pheromone-baited traps can be used to determine whether adults of a particular species are present and to time insecticide applications targeting young larvae. Adult captures coincide with egg laying and the approximate time of egg hatching for most species except fruittree leafroller. Conserve natural enemies, which often keep leafroller populations low. Parasitic wasps and tachinid flies are especially common in leafroller larvae and pupae. Trichogramma parasites kill some eggs. Assassin bugs, green lacewing larvae, ground beetles, and certain other beetles and spiders are common predators of leafrollers. Otherwise healthy trees tolerate the loss of some leaves, and low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. If fruittree leafroller has been a problem, apply horticultural oil in January or February to thoroughly cover limbs and small twigs infested with overwintering eggs. Because oil spray can damage dormant plum and walnut trees, spray infested foliage on these hosts during the growing season if leafrollers are a problem. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae). A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. If larger larvae in rolled leaves are abundant, use a high-pressure sprayer so the insecticide penetrates into rolled foliage. Because fruittree leafroller has only one generation per year, by the time chewed leaves are obvious or trees are defoliated, the caterpillar stage might be almost completed and spraying leaves may be of little benefit. For more information, consult Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees.",

        "life_cycle": "In summer, first-generation crawlers move out from bark to infest fruit and foliage mid-June to mid-July. Some females mature in late August to September and lay eggs on fruit; most return to old wood to lay overwintering eggs. In early spring, crawlers move from bark to new shoots.",
        "damage": "Mealybugs excrete large quantities of sticky honeydew, which drips onto fruit clusters and later turns black from sooty mold. Some berries may crack. Mealybugs do not injure vines.",
        "solutions": "Remove loose bark in winter; young mealybugs and eggs are concealed in such places until spring. High temperatures in June kill much of the most damaging brood. Control of ants (which interfere with natural enemies) is important. Oils applied during grapevine dormancy can reduce numbers somewhat. For more information about other mealybugs and their management, see the Pest Notes: Mealybugs.",

        "description": "Larvae (caterpillars) of this moth (Erebidae: Arctiinae) make prominent, silk tents on shoot terminals. The caterpillars can feed on more than 100 species of woody broadleaves, including birch, cottonwood, elm, fruit and nut trees, liquidambar, maple, mulberry, poplar, sycamore, and willow. Larvae of various species are called webworms because of the profuse, silk webbing they excrete on foliage where they feed. Fall webworm, mimosa webworm, and others typically occur in webbed colonies on leaves and twigs at the terminal (outer tip) of branches. This helps to distinguish them from tent caterpillars, which usually web inner foliage around the juncture (crotch) of branches. Fall webworm larvae grow up to 1 inch long and vary greatly in color. In California, they commonly are gray, orangish, or yellowish brown and have black, orange, or white hairs arising from black or orange projections (tubercles) along the body. The adult (moth) has a wingspan of about 1-1/2 inches and a hairy body that is white on top. The forewings are all white or white with brown or black spots. The hind wings (hidden when at rest) and abdomen are orangish. Adult moths emerge in the late spring or early summer. In June or July the females lay globular, white or yellow eggs in large masses on host foliage. About 1 week after they are laid, eggs hatch and the larvae feed in groups as they form and gradually enlarge silken tents during summer through early fall. Fall webworms overwinter in dark-brown to reddish cocoons on the host bark or the ground. In California there are one or two generations per year. From July to September, fall webworm caterpillars eat leaves (except not the veins) and form silken tents on host trees. The caterpillars do not feed on fruit or nuts, but these may become sunburned and drop prematurely if defoliation is severe. Yield quantity may be reduced the season after fruit or nut trees are extensively defoliated. Regularly inspect hosts for silken tents during the summer. On small trees, cut out and destroy infested twigs (e.g., use a pole saw, a blade on the end of a telescoping pole). Alternatively, remove webworm tents and the caterpillars inside by twirling or scrubbing the webbing into a ball using a toilet brush or similar tool attached to a telescoping pole, then dispose of or crush the larvae. If nests are abundant and cannot be pruned off or tolerated, apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad with a high-pressure sprayer to penetrate webbed foliage. The addition of a wetting agent to increase penetration of webbing by the insecticide enhances control. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only butterfly and moth larvae that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Using this selective insecticide avoids adversely affecting the parasitic tachinid flies and wasps that kill webworm larvae and pupae and Trichogramma wasps that parasitize the eggs. The somewhat-selective spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply it to plants that are flowering. If caterpillar-infested trees are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. Request they apply caterpillar-selective Bt, or spinosad if the plants to be sprayed are not blossoming.

        "description": "Larvae of two types of flies (families Drosophilidae, called drosophilids and Tephritidae, called tephritids) commonly infest certain fruits or nuts. Both fly types are called fruit flies.",
        "identification": "Adults can be observed on and flying around hosts. They can be captured in various types of monitoring traps, and the best traps use a bait that attracts the flies. Eggs and larvae live hidden in fruit or nuts, as may pupae. Pupae can also live in organic litter and topsoil under infested host plants. Eggs, mature larvae, and pupae of tephritids are twice or more the size of those of drosophilids. Drosophilid flies. Also called pomace or vinegar flies, the adults and mature larvae are 1/12 to 1/8 inch (2 to 3 mm) long. Adults are brown to yellowish flies with red eyes. Adults of most species have clear wings and are not readily distinguished to species. Larvae are pale orangish, translucent, or whitish. They have an indistinct, forked breathing tube at the rear and dark mouthparts in front. Pupae are generally brownish and have forked breathing tubes at their rear end. They are found in, on, or near damaged fruit where they fed as larvae. The species important for home fruit growers is the spotted-wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii). Males of spotted-wing drosophila have a dark blotch near the tip of each wing. Where female spotted-wing drosophila lay eggs they leave a tiny depression in fruit with a hole in the center. Tephritid flies. Adults are about 1/4 inch (6 mm) long and mature larvae are up to 1/2 inch (12 mm) long. Adults can generally be distinguished to species by their coloration and wing markings. Eggs are long, slender, whitish, and less than 1/25 inch (1 mm) long. Larvae are rounded at the rear and tapered toward the front. They have indistinct, dark mouthparts and overall are translucent to whitish. Larvae can take on a pale coloration of the fruit on which they feed. Pupae are pale brownish to orange, oblong, rounded at the rear end, and tapered toward the front. Pest tephritid fruit flies established in California include apple maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella), olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae), and walnut husk fly (Rhagoletis completa). Western cherry fruit fly (Rhagoletis indifferens) occurs in Washington and some other states. Other exotic tephritid species have been repeatedly introduced into California and eradicated. These include Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), melon fly (Bactrocera cucurbitae), Mexican fruit fly (Anastrepha ludens), and Oriental fruit fly (Dacus dorsalis).",
        "life_cycle": "Fruit flies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After hatching, larvae develop through three increasingly larger instars. Mature larvae (prepupae) generally emerge from fruit to pupate but may be found in or on fruit. Fruit flies overwinter as prepupae or pupae on the ground. Adults emerge the following spring or summer. The number of generations varies by species and growing location. For example, spotted-wing drosophila can have up to 10 generations per year. Olive fruit fly can have up to 5 generations per year. Walnut husk fly has 1 generation per year.",
        "damage": "Drosophilid or vinegar flies, such as the common Drosophila melanogaster, as larvae feed in damaged or fermenting, overripe fruit of all kinds. Most species do not feed in undamaged fruit. Fruit fly larvae that feed in undamaged fruit directly damage the fruit and cause it to become contaminated with microorganisms that contribute to decay. The introduced spotted-wing drosophila is a serious pest because it feeds as larvae in otherwise undamaged, ripening fruit. Host fruits of the spotted-wing drosophila include ripening blackberry, blueberry, cherry, raspberry, and strawberry. It occasionally attacks boysenberry, Japanese plum, nectarine, and plumcot. The tephritids established in California are host specific. They primarily infest the fruit or nut crop of their common name. The exotic tephritid flies that have been repeatedly introduced and eradicated from California (e.g., Mediterranean fruit fly, melon fly, Mexican fruit fly, and Oriental fruit fly) each feed inside numerous species of fruits.",
        "solutions": "Take any tephritid flies or maggots you find in fruit or nuts to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner for identification unless you are confident the species found is already known to be established in California. For example, compare the wing markings of the species found to those of the tephritids that are known to occur here. Use sanitation to help suppress the abundance of fruit flies. Remove and dispose of overripe fruit, such as that dropped on the ground. For certain species, specialized traps can help to reduce fly abundance but these will not provide complete control. Spinosad applied at the proper times can control these fruit flies. For example, the formulation GF-120 NF Naturalyte Fruit Fly Bait combines spinosad with an attractive bait for spot spraying to control fruit flies. Pyrethrins, or pyrethrins sold premixed with piperonyl butoxide, can also be applied to quickly reduce the abundance of vinegar flies.

Deutonymphs (first-stage immatures) are about one-half the length of adults. Protonymphs (older immatures) are about the same length as adults. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the head (wider) end of their body. The oval eggs are translucent to white and about one-fourth the length of adults.",

As buds swell and burst, the mites enter the expanding leaf buds and females lay eggs. During her 1-month life span, an adult female can lay about 80 eggs, which hatch into both female and male mites. All developmental stages are present during the summer and early fall. During the growing season, the mites may be found on fruit and leaves. In late fall and winter, the mites aggregate in colonies in or near buds on the canes. Development from egg to adult takes 1 to 2 weeks, the quicker at warmer temperatures. There are many overlapping generations each year.",
        "damage": "Mite feeding causes drupelets to become dry and hard and fail to develop their mature color. This makes berries unappetizing. Mite feeding can also cause yellow leaf spots that become reddish and necrotic. Note that redberry mite (Phyllocoptes gracilis) causes similar damage to fruit of blackberry and rarely raspberry and can also be managed as below.",
        "solutions": "Predaceous mites such as Phytoseiulus persimilis may help to reduce the abundance of dryberry mite and redberry mite. To improve the potential effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dust (e.g., periodically hose off plants), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all caneberry pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. At the time mite damage to fruit becomes apparent, it is too late for control to be effective. If fruit damage the previous season was intolerable, spray a micronized or wettable sulfur on buds and terminals at the delayed-dormant stage, after buds swell but just before they open. This is the time when the overwintered mites become active and miticide application can be most effective. Azadirachtin, narrow-range or horticultural oil, or neem oil can be sprayed at two to three week intervals after the green fruit stage. Do not apply oil within 1 month before or after a sulfur application and vice versa or plant damage can occur.

        "description": "This eriophyid mite (family Eriophyidae) is named rust mite on oranges and silver mite on lemons. It can occur on all citrus varieties. It is a sporadic pest in most growing areas and occurs primarily in southern coastal areas of the state. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants.",
        "identification": "Citrus rust mites are less than 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long. A magnification of at least 20\u00d7 is needed to see them. They are carrot or wedge shaped, tapering at toward the rear. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the front (wider) end near the body. Their coloration is pale brownish to yellow. The minute eggs are spherical and translucent to whitish with a smooth surface. Eggs are about one-fourth the length of adults. They occur singly or in groups of several in depressions on fruit, leaves, or small twigs.",
        "life_cycle": "Citrus rust mite develops through 4 life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. The life span of an adult female is about 2 to 3 weeks, during which she deposits about 1 to 2 eggs per day. Highest abundance on fruit occurs from late spring through summer, but mite feeding on fruit continues during fall and early winter. During warm weather egg to adult development is completed in about 7 to 10 days. Citrus rust mite has many generations per year.",
        "damage": "The mite and its feeding damage generally occur on the outside surface of fruit that is 1/2 inch or more in diameter. Feeding damages rind cells and causes the fruit surface to become silvery on lemons, rust brown on mature oranges, or black on green oranges. Most damage occurs from late spring to late summer, but does not hurt the internal quality of the fruit.",
        "solutions": "Predaceous mites, dustywings, and mite midges prey on citrus rust mite. It is not known if these are important in the biological control of this pest, but natural enemies are responsible for preventing many potential pests in citrus from becoming a problem. To improve the effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dust (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all citrus pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. No control is needed in gardens and landscapes as the feeding of citrus rust mite causes only aesthetic damage to the rind. If the rust mites are abundant and marring of fruit skins is intolerable, micronized or wettable sulfur can be applied. Note that spraying sulfur during hot weather can damage foliage, so application during November to early May is recommended. Do not apply sulfur within 60 days of spraying horticultural (narrow-range) oil and vice versa or plant damage may occur.

        "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/citrredmite.html?src=exchbt",
        "description": "This spider mite (family Tetranychidae) can discolor fruit and leaves of any citrus variety. It occurs in all citrus-growing areas of California but is most common in the Central Valley during late winter and spring. Although its discoloring damage can be dramatic, citrus can tolerate high populations without affecting fruit yield. An exception is during fall and winter Santa Ana conditions in Southern California. Then dry winds combined with moderate red mite densities can cause substantial premature drop of leaves that greatly stresses host plants.",
        "identification": "Citrus red mite produces little or no webbing on plants. This distinguishes it from some other Tetranychidae in citrus, which excrete fine silk strands on foliage and fruit. Citrus red mite adults and nymphs are red to purplish. Adult females are globular, oval, and about 1/50 inch (0.5 mm) long. The male is somewhat smaller and its abdomen tapers toward the rear. Males are commonly found near molting female deutonymphs (immatures), waiting to mate with them when they mature into adults. Eggs can occur anywhere on citrus but are often found along the midrib vein of leaves. The globular, red eggs have a curved stalk on top and from its tip 10 to 12 threads radiate down to the leaf surface. Eggs of European red mite are also red with a stalk, but lack the radiating threads. At least seven species of spider mites can be pests on citrus in California. Although citrus red mite is the most common of these, hydrangea mite (Kanzawa spider mite), Lewis spider mite, sixspotted mite, Texas citrus mite, twospotted spider mite, and Yuma spider mite can also discolor citrus fruit or leaves or both in certain growing areas.",
        "life_cycle": "Citrus red mite and other spider mites develop through 5 life stages. The egg hatches into a 6-legged larva, then becomes an 8-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. Preceding each molt, mites enter a brief resting stage during which they do not move. The life cycle from egg to egg-laying adult can be as short as 12 days. Each adult female citrus red mite lays from 20 to 50 eggs at a rate of 2 or 3 a day, depositing them on both sides of leaves. Citrus red mite overwinters primarily as eggs, although all stages can be present year-round. Populations increase in the spring, late summer, and early fall in response to new leaf growth; citrus red mites prefer to feed on young leaves but will also infest fully expanded mature leaves and fruit. In cooler growing areas on young lemon and orange trees, the mites can be numerous throughout the year because repeated growth flushes provide preferred food almost continuously. Natural enemies, temperatures above 90\u00b0F, low humidity, and the absence of succulent, young foliage reduce the abundance of citrus red mite. ",
        "damage": "Citrus red mite feeds on more than 100 plant species including almond, pear, and rose, but it is only a pest on citrus. Adults and nymphs suck cell sap from leaves and fruit, causing bleaching or pale stippling of surfaces. Stippling of the leaves or fruit peel does not hurt the quality of the fruit inside. In severe infestations, leaf stippling enlarges to become dry, necrotic (brown) areas. Severely damaged leaves may drop prematurely, and twigs may die back. In coastal and Southern California growing areas, during Santa Ana winds in the fall, citrus red mite in combination with the wind can result in blasting or burning and drop of leaves. High mite populations that cause leaf drop can also contribute to fruit sunburn and reduced fruit yield during the next crop. The mite stippling or silvering of green fruit usually disappears as fruit develop their mature color. When abundant mites feed on nearly mature fruit, the silvering may persist, but this damage is only aesthetic.",
        "solutions": "Ensure that trees are adequately irrigated, especially when hot or windy weather is anticipated. Citrus red mites have numerous natural enemies, which often keep the pest from becoming abundant on trees that are not treated with miticides or broad-spectrum insecticides. Predaceous mites and insects and a virus disease can greatly reduce the abundance of citrus red mite. Euseius species of mites are the most important predators of citrus red mite in most growing areas. Predatory mites feed mostly on eggs and immature stages of citrus red mite. The spider mite destroyer (a tiny black lady beetle, or ladybug) and sixspotted thrips are the most important mite predators in desert valleys, but in other growing areas they are less commonly observed in comparison with Euseius species. Green lacewings can be common predators in all growing areas. Predaceous mite midges (Feltiella species) and (less commonly) a rove beetle (Oligota oviformis) prey on citrus red mite in coastal areas. A virus disease specific to citrus red mite is widespread in citrus-growing areas away from the coast. When hot, dry temperatures exceeding 90\u00b0F occur for several consecutive days and high mite populations are present, virus epidemics occur and rapidly reduce citrus red mite populations. Symptoms of virus infection include mites that walk stiffly and curl their legs under their body. As they die, their bodies disintegrate and sometimes leave reddish brown to black watery spots on fruit or leaves. If diseased mites are mounted on a slide and examined under a light polarizing microscope, virus crystals that shine can be observed in the cell nuclei. To improve the effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of miticides and broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides for all citrus pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. Insecticide application is generally not necessary for residential citrus trees to protect fruit flavor or yield. If spider mites have been intolerable, a spray of horticultural oil in August or September in Southern California and coastal areas or spring sprays in the San Joaquin Valley can reduce mite abundance. Note that oil sprayed during hot weather can injure foliage.

        "description": "Severely deformed blossoms, foliage, or fruit are generally the first clues that this eriophyid mite (family Eriophyidae) is present. It is an occasional pest on lemons any time of year near the coast and less frequently in interior southern areas. It rarely or never is a pest in the Central Valley or desert areas or on citrus varieties in California other than lemons. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants.",
        "identification": "Citrus bud mites are about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long and a magnification of at least 20\u00d7 is needed to see them. They are carrot or wedge shaped, tapering toward the rear. Adults and nymphs have 4 legs at the front (wider) end near the mouth. Their coloration is pale green, pinkish, or yellowish. The spherical eggs are translucent to whitish. Where bud mites have previously been a problem, examine the buds at leaf axils on green twigs from midspring through autumn. A leaf axil is the narrow or inside angle where a leaf petiole attaches to a stem and new buds (axillary buds) commonly develop at this location. Dissect some axillary buds and examine them with a 20\u00d7 hand lens or dissecting binocular microscope with good lighting to estimate the percentage of buds infested with 1 or more live eriophyid mites. An alternative detection method is to collect axillary buds and place them in a container with 90% ethyl alcohol. Shake this for about 10 seconds so buds are thoroughly coated and any eriophyids are killed and dislodged. At a magnification of at least 20\u00d7, examine the fluid for pale, elongate eriophyid mites.",
        "life_cycle": "Citrus bud mites develop through 4 life stages: egg, protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. During her life span the adult female lays about 50 eggs mostly in the bud scales of new growth. Eggs are deposited singly or in groups of several. After hatching, nymphs and adults feed protected inside buds or between where a bud and leaf petiole touch. Egg to adult development is about 10 to 15 days when temperatures are warm.",
        "damage": "Citrus bud mites are a pest of lemons mostly along the California coast. Their feeding inside the buds kills them and sometimes blackens them. Its feeding causes a rosettelike (bunchy) growth of the subsequent foliage and distortion of flowers and fruit. Fall blooms, and the fruit that develop from them, are most likely to suffer damage. Treatment thresholds for bud mite has not been established. Even as high as 80% of buds infested with this mite may not cause consistent or predictable damage to the developing fruit.",
        "solutions": "In gardens and landscapes, predatory mites are believed to help keep bud mites under good control. Black hunter thrips and predaceous mite midges also feed on citrus bud mite. To improve the effectiveness of biological control, control ants, minimize dust (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all citrus pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. Once fruit is set, damage has already occurred and cannot be prevented or corrected. If a reduction in bud mite populations is desired, apply a miticide 2 to 3 months before bloom. Horticultural (narrow-range) oil sprays applied prior to bloom may provide some control of citrus bud mite. Late-fall oil sprays may also help to control the mites. The most effective products for this mite are only available by hiring a professional applicator. For how to get the services you want, consult Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company.

        "description": "Sawflies (Tenthredinidae) are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the females' jagged (sawtoothed), egg-laying organ. The California pear sawfly is an occasional pest of pears.",
        "identification": "Adults are stout wasps about 1/4 inch long with two pairs of wings with distinct veins. They have a black body with yellow on the legs and prothorax, the area immediately behind the head. Adults have a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae of California pear sawfly are bright green and up to 1/2 inch long. The head is light brown with a small, black, eye spot on each side. In addition to three pairs of true legs behind the head, the larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two to seven (six pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage have five or fewer pairs of prolegs. The green body of California pear sawfly can be hard to spot on leaves, especially because larvae commonly feed with their body aligned along the inside edge of holes they are chewing. When California pear sawfly feeds along leaf margins, the damage can resemble the half-moon-shaped cuts of leafcutting bees, which are beneficial pollinators. Note that the pear sawfly (cherryslug, or pearslug) is a different, more-damaging species. Unlike California pear sawfly, larvae of the pear sawfly excrete an olive-green coating that gives the appearance of a slug (shell-less mollusk).",
        "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The California pear sawfly overwinters as a mature, inactive larva (prepupa) in a silk cocoon in litter on the ground and in topsoil. Pupation and adult emergence occur in early spring. After mating, females insert tiny, translucent to white eggs singly into leaf tissue, commonly in the margins of leaves in the lower part of the tree. Most eggs hatch by petal fall and the larvae immediately begin feeding as they develop through several increasingly larger instars (immature stages). Larvae mature about May, then drop to the ground to overwinter. There is one generation per year.",
        "damage": "Larvae of California pear sawfly and their feeding damage occur only during spring. The larvae chew circular holes in leaves. When larvae are abundant, entire leaves can be consumed except for the midrib. Otherwise-healthy trees can tolerate a significant amount of leaf chewing without threatening tree health.",
        "solutions": "Birds, predatory wasps, and other natural enemies feed on this sporadic pest. Natural enemies sometimes cause a dramatic decline in the abundance of sawfly larvae over a relatively short period of time. California pear sawfly is not commonly abundant in California and the larvae do not feed on fruit. Generally no control is recommended.

The leafhopper overwinters as nymphs on ornamental hosts such as privet, boxwood, pyracantha, etc. and as eggs on ornamental hosts and deciduous fruit trees. There are three periods of adult activity: mid-April through May, during July, and September through October. The mountain leafhopper is a slender, active leafhopper with a yellow band behind the head and a yellow spot in the center of each wing.

        "description": "This spider mite (family Tetranychidae) is occasionally abundant on avocado trees growing in coastal areas. From about July to September it can cause noticeable bronzing (browning) of leaves and premature leaf drop. Note that numerous species of mites can occur on plants.",
        "identification": "To locate avocado brown mite and its webbing, use a hand lens to inspect along the midrib on the upper surface of avocado leaves. The mites are mostly dark brown with an oval body and two red eyespots. The head and legs are a lighter color than the rest of the body. Adult females are about 1/75 inch (0.34 mm) long; males and immatures are smaller. Adults and immatures have numerous bristles covering the body and legs. The globular eggs are pale brown and have a slender stalk projecting from the top. Avocado brown mite feeds almost entirely on the upper surface of leaves and produces relatively little silk. This and its dark brown coloration distinguish avocado brown mite from persea mite and sixspotted mite, which are greenish to yellowish, produce noticeable silk, and feed mostly on the underside of avocado leaves. ",
        "life_cycle": "Avocado brown mite develops through 5 life stages: egg, 6-legged larva, and 8-legged protonymph, deutonymph, and adult. When its abundance is low, adult females lay most eggs singly along the midrib. As abundance increases, eggs are increasingly found throughout the upper leaf surface. Temperatures of 90\u00b0 to 95\u00b0F or higher kill many of these mites and their eggs, as does the first cold weather in fall or early winter. In summer there may be 2 complete generations per month.",
        "damage": "Avocado brown mite feeds by sucking on avocado leaves. It causes no significant damage when its numbers are low to moderate, 20 adult females or less per leaf. Damage occurs if avocado brown mites average about 50 to 70 adult females per leaf or about 100 to 200 motile stages (adults and nymphs combined) or more. At these higher densities, mites also colonize the lower leaf surface and sometimes the fruit and can partially defoliate trees. These higher populations cause leaf bronzing along the midrib, then along smaller veins, and finally the entire leaf turns brown. Avocado brown mite damage can occur in late summer and fall when leaf browning and the mite's whitish eggshells and cast skins can become obvious to the naked eye. Abundant mites can occur in dusty conditions because dust prevents the mite's predators from being effective. The application of a broad-spectrum, persistence insecticide to control other avocado pests (e.g., greenhouse thrips or omnivorous looper) kills the natural enemies of avocado mite and can cause the mite to quickly become very abundant and damaging. ",
        "solutions": "Temperature (hot or cold weather) and predators commonly keep populations of this mite at low, innocuous levels. The most important predator is the spider mite destroyer, a tiny, black lady beetle (ladybug). Predaceous mites, especially Euseius hibisci and Galendromus helveolus, are also helpful, but are primarily effective against sixspotted mite. Black hunter thrips, brown lacewings, dustywings, green lacewings , and sixspotted thrips also prey on avocado brown mite. Provide trees with the appropriate amount and frequency of irrigation during the dry season to reduce the likelihood of mite outbreaks and increase tree tolerance to their feeding. Avoid fertilizing avocado, especially with quick release nitrogen formulations, because excessive nitrogen in leaves can increase mite abundance. To improve the effectiveness of naturally occurring mite predators, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off small trees), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides and miticides for all pests. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. If avocado brown mites are unacceptably abundant, horticultural (narrow-range) oil can be sprayed on foliage. Thoroughly cover the upper surface of leaves where this species occurs. Note that if persea mite or sixspotted mite are also abundant, lower leaf surfaces must also be well covered with spray because these mites feed mostly on the underside of leaves.

        "solutions": "Prune out dying and dead parts of vine and remove or burn all prunings before March, as these are breeding sites for the beetles. Keep area free of prunings and wood cut from fruit and nut trees and ornamentals. The many species of general predators found under the bark of grapevines may assist in maintaining lower populations. Treatments with commercial formulations of the entomopathogenic nematode Steinernema carpocapsae, which can move through frass tubes to infect larvae, may be of some benefit.

        "description": "This snout beetle, or weevil (family Curculionidae), feeds on many woody plants. Hosts include acacia, avocado, box elder, citrus, oak, photinia, Prunus and Pyrus species, Rhaphiolepis species, and rose. Adults are brown to gray, hard-bodied weevils about 3/8 inch long with bulging eyes. The shape and orientation of the head distinguish Fuller rose beetle from two other brown to grayish snout beetles that are also common in California, the cribrate weevil (Otiorhynchus cribricollis) and vegetable weevil (Listroderes difficilis). Eggs of Fuller rose beetle are yellowish, about 1/25 inch long, and occur in a mass of several dozen. They commonly occur in cracks and crevices of tree bark. In citrus, eggs can be laid underneath the sepals (button) of fruit. Larvae are plump, oblong, whitish to yellow, and legless. They have a brown head and grow up to 1/2 inch long. Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. All Fuller rose beetles are females that reproduce and lay eggs without mating. After hatching, larvae drop to the ground and live in the soil where they chew and feed on roots for about 6 to 10 months. Mature larvae pupate in the soil for 1-1/2 to 2 months. Adults emerge from pupae mostly during summer and fall. They feed at night. During the day they seek shelter in organic litter on the ground. Adults are flightless and reach the canopy by climbing up the trunk or branches that touch the ground or vegetation. Fuller rose beetle has one generation per year. Larvae chew and feed on roots, but generally this does not threaten plant health. Adults chew along the margins of leaves, creating notches and ragged, sharp edges. Adult feeding is not a concern for plant health, except perhaps when the weevil populations are high and feeding on young hosts or plants that have been extensively pruned and are producing new buds and leaves. Adults also may chew blossoms, which along with leaf chewing reduces the aesthetic quality of plants. A tiny wasp (Fidiobia citri, Platygastridae) commonly parasitizes eggs of Fuller rose beetle. The Fidiobia adult is a mostly black wasp less than 1/25 inch long. The adult female lays one egg inside each weevil egg. Fidiobia can parasitize up to 50% of the eggs in each Fuller rose beetle egg mass. In contrast to the pale yellow to whitish color of unparasitized eggs, parasitized eggs turn dark gold then blacken shortly before the adult Fidiobia emerges; parasitized eggs may persist long after unparasitized eggs have hatched. Feeding by Fuller rose beetle does not seriously harm established, otherwise healthy woody plants and generally can be ignored. Provide proper cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate insect feeding. Trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material (e.g., Tanglefoot) to trunks to prevent the flightless adults from climbing up to feed on foliage. First wrap the trunk several inches wide with landscape fabric or plastic, then apply the sticky material on top the wrap to avoid potential bark injury from the sticky material. Periodically replace wraps to prevent growth-restriction damage to trunks. If adult populations are high, trapping may help provide some control. No insecticides are recommended for this insect in gardens and landscapes.

Other insects distribute the virus when they walk through the diarrhetic blotches. There are four typical symptoms of infection in adults and larvae: 1) eggs are scattered and the number of eggs is reduced, 2) eggs fail to hatch, 3) larvae consume tiny patches of tissue rather than consuming entire areas of the leaf, and 4) larval growth and coloration change and larvae shrink and eventually die.",

        "description": "Shot hole disease affects Prunus spp. Hosts include almonds, Catalina and Japanese flowering cherries, English laurel, ornamental plums, nectarines, peaches, and especially apricot. The disease will develop on cherries, plums, and prunes only when growing near more susceptible hosts during years with unusually wet weather during winter and spring. Shot hole first appears in the spring as purplish or reddish spots about 1/10 inch in diameter on new buds, leaves, and shoots. Spots on young leaves commonly have a narrow, light green or yellow margin. The spots expand and their centers turn brown and can drop out, leaving holes. The fungal disease also causes premature leaf drop, rough and corky or scabby lesions on fruit that are brown with dark purple margins and mostly on the upper surface, and small cankers on branches. Tiny, dark specks (sporodochium and spores) visible with a hand lens form in the centers of brown spots, especially on buds; these dark fungal spores help to distinguish shot hole from other diseases. The fungus overwinters in infected buds and twig lesions. The spores spread in splashing water. Disease is most severe following warm, foggy or rainy winters and when it rains in the spring during young leaf growth. Spores that land on twigs, buds, blossoms, or young leaves require 24 hours of continuous wetness to cause infection. Only the current season's growth is susceptible to infection. In California, twig and bud infections of apricot, nectarine, and peach can occur during rainy weather any time between fall and spring. Buds of peach, nectarine, and sometimes apricot are killed in the winter. The fungus can germinate and infect at temperatures as low as 36\u00b0F. When zinc sulfate is sprayed on foliage in late October to early November to hasten leaf fall, shot hole inoculum is prevented from increasing. Otherwise, high levels of inoculum may develop and overwinter on the trees, infecting leaves the following spring. Use low-volume sprinklers, drip irrigation, or sprinkler deflectors and prune off lower branches to prevent foliage wetting from irrigation. Prune and dispose of infected plant tissue as soon as it appears. After leaf drop, inspect plants carefully and prune varnished-appearing (infected) buds and twigs with lesions. Diligent sanitation and directing irrigation water away from foliage provide adequate control where the incidence of shot hole is low. Where disease is severe on high-value plants, Bordeaux mixture, fixed copper, or certain synthetic fungicides such as chlorothalonil can be applied after leaf drop. Retreatment in late winter before buds swell or between full bloom and petal fall or both times may be necessary on highly susceptible apricot or if prolonged wet weather occurs in the spring.",

Pruning wound cankers, however, are not associated with Pierce's disease as they are with Eutypa dieback. Phylloxera causes a decline of vines; look for phylloxera insects on roots. Oak root fungus can cause wilting, along with discoloration and drying of fruit and foliage, but fungal fans will be evident beneath bark in crown area.",
        "life_cycle": "Pierce's disease is a lethal disease of grapevines and is caused by the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. It is spread by certain kinds of leafhoppers known as sharpshooters. The green sharpshooter, Draeculacephala minerva, and the red-headed sharpshooter, Carneocephala fulgida, are the primary vectors in California's Central Valley. The blue-green sharpshooter, Graphocephala atropunctata, is the most prevalent in coastal regions such as the Napa Valley. A new large sharpshooter, the glassy-winged sharpshooter was introduced into California in the 1990's. It is now prevalent in southern California and parts of the San Joaquin Valley. It spreads Pierce's disease more effectively than the other sharpshooters. Sharpshooters pick up the bacterium by feeding on symptomless plant hosts as well as infected grapes and transfer it to healthy grapes by feeding. Leaves become scorched and dwarfed, grapes may raisin, and overall vines become stunted and late in growth.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Pierce's disease is spread to vines by sharpshooters from many alternate hosts for the disease including bermudagrass, blackberry, and willow. There is little spread from grape to grape. Control of sharpshooters is not effective, although removal of alternate hosts may help. Grape varieties vary in susceptibility. 'Sylvaner', 'Thompson Seedless', and 'Ruby Cabernet' are less susceptible than other varieties. Remove vines as they become unproductive and replant with less susceptible cultivars.

Infected pear and other rose family plants develop discolored spots with dry, powdery or rough, reddish, yellowish, or orange spore masses. Groups of tiny, cup-shaped, spore-forming bodies appear as pustules on fruit, green stems, and leaves. On fruiting pears, infections occur primarily on the fruit. Gymnosporangium libocedri alternates between incense cedar and apple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, quince, and serviceberry. Spores are produced on incense cedar in the spring and disperse in air to infect the young tissues of pear and the other rosaceous hosts. Wet weather favors rust disease, so infection and damage is more common on rosaceous hosts when it is rainy in the spring. The fungus grows in infected rosaceous hosts and produces airborne spores that infect incense cedar, usually in late summer or fall. Flower petals, fruit, green stems, and leaves can become spotted. Infected fruit become distorted. Fruit and leaves may drop prematurely. Avoid overhead watering. Dispose of infected fruit, leaves, and shoots as soon as symptoms appear. Fungicides applied in the spring can prevent or reduce rust disease. Because Gymnosporangium damage to fruit is uncommon in California, the applications required to prevent pear rust may not be warranted.

On fruit, rust appears as small, sunken dark spots. A small area around each spot remains greenish or yellow when the fruit begins to color, and the lesion often splits open by the time the fruit is ripe. If the surface of a lesion is peeled back, rust-colored, spongy spore masses can be seen. ",

        "description": "Phytophthora cinnamomi and other Phytophthora spp. commonly cause maladies that are also called collar rots, foot rots, and Phytophthora root rot. These funguslike water molds (Oomycetes) affect many plant species. Phytophthora ramorum infects aboveground plant parts and causes sudden oak death and Ramorum blight.",
        "identification": "Root- and crown-infecting Phytophthora cause leaves to wilt, discolor, remain undersized, and drop prematurely. Twigs and branches die back and the entire plant, especially when young, can be killed as roots and vascular tissue die. Plants infected when they are mature grow slowly and may gradually decline. Small brownish lesions encircling feeder roots are an early symptom of infection. As disease progresses, the small, fibrous feeder roots become scarce. Where present, the small roots are black, brittle, and dead from infection. Woody roots decaying from Phytophthora alone are firm and brittle but eventually soften as secondary decay organisms develop. Depending on environmental conditions and the species of pathogen and host plant, sap that is black, brown, or reddish may ooze from darkened areas of trunk bark. Cutting away bark from the basal trunk and roots often reveals a brown or reddish streak, stain, or canker in infected wood with a water-soaked margin separating it from the healthy whitish or yellowish wood. Confirmation of Phytophthora requires sending an appropriate plant sample with viable infection to a diagnostic laboratory. Test kits that employ the serological (antigen-antibody) technique ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are available for use in the field to confirm the presence of Phytophthora where research-based sampling recommendations have been developed.",
        "life_cycle": "Phytophthora spp. can survive in the soil for many years. They require high soil moisture to infect host roots, so the pathogen thrives in areas of excess soil moisture and poor drainage. The pathogen infects the smaller (feeder) roots. Infected root tissue develops spore-forming structures (sporangia) and produces spores (chlamydospores, oospores, zoospores). Phytophthora spores spread from tree to tree easily and rapidly in water as it moves over or through the soil and the spores persist in soil and water. Phytophthora spp. are commonly introduced into gardens and landscapes through the planting of infested nursery stock. After planting, disease develops and the introduced Phytophthora spreads in the landscape in drainage water and soil movement. Phytophthora also spreads through the movement of contaminated equipment and shoes and through any human or animal activity that moves moist soil from one place to another.",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Use only nursery stock that has been certified to be free of Phytophthora spp. and obtain plants from reputable local suppliers. Inspect roots and reject plants that show decayed roots or evidence of crown rot. Prepare the site well before planting, use excellent sanitation, and provide appropriate cultural care, especially proper irrigation. Good water management is the most important factor in reducing the threat of Phytophthora root and crown rot. Where soils are compacted, drain poorly, or are often soggy, improve drainage and plant only species not reported to be susceptible to P. cinnamomi. Some pesticides (e.g., phosphonates) help to control certain Phytophthora spp. if combined with practices such as avoiding overirrigation and improving drainage. However, plants larger than medium-sized shrubs can be difficult to effectively treat in landscapes. For more information, see the Pest Notes: Phytophthora Root and Crown Rot in the Garden.",

The cause is generally Eutypa lata, but other fungi in the Diatrypaceae family can be involved. For example in grapes in the North Coast, Eutypa leptoplaca also causes Eutypa dieback.",
        "identification": "Spring growth of leaves with faded color, undersized leaves, and wilting are commonly the first-observed symptoms of Eutypa dieback. Affected limbs have cankers where bark can be dark and roughened. Cutting off bark adjacent to old pruning wounds can expose cankered wood, which is dark and may be cracked, swollen, or both. Discolored wood may extend beyond the edge of the canker and into heartwood. If limb cankers are cut in cross-section, the darkly discolored wood is commonly U shaped or wedge shaped. Brown gum can exude from bark at the margins of cankers. Several years after the initial infection, a layer of dark fungal tissue (stroma) forms on the surface of cankered wood where bark has sloughed off. Stroma give limbs a blackened, burnt appearance. In wet locations spore-forming structures (perithecia) form in stroma on wood that has been dead for at least 2 years. The perithecia are black and spherical and can be observed by cutting into stroma and examining the fungal tissue with a hand lens. Perithecia are produced if annual rainfall is at least 14 inches. Perithecia also occur at sites of lower rainfall if hosts are irrigated with sprinklers that wet infected wood.",
        "life_cycle": "Eutypa spores are spread by splashing irrigation sprinklers, rain, and wind. The spores infect hosts through wounds, commonly pruning wounds. Eutypa lata develops within hosts' vascular tissue, killing cambium, invading heartwood, and decaying and weakening limbs. After an initial infection, several growing seasons may elapse before the symptoms of cankers, dieback, and stunted shoots develop. Once a limb has been killed, it takes several more years before spores are produced on the old infected host tissue and then only under conditions of high moisture. Ascospores are the only known infective stage of Eutypa lata. The spores are discharged during periods of rain, primarily fall through spring, and when infected limbs are wetted by sprinklers. The spores can spread long distances with wind and infect hosts when they land on tissue that was wounded relatively recently. During cool weather pruning wounds can remain susceptible to infection for 6 or more weeks after the cuts were made. During warm weather pruning wounds remain susceptible to infection for about 2 weeks after the injury. Eutypa lata can infect hosts other than grape and stone fruits. Eutypa dieback generally is not a significant problem in these other hosts, but they can be sources of spores that initiate infection and serious disease in grape and stone fruits. Other reservoirs for the pathogen include almond, apple, blueberry, crabapple, honeysuckle, kiwi, oleander, pear, and certain native plants (e.g., big leaf maple, California buckeye, ceanothus, and willow).",
        "damage": "Eutypa dieback is a serious disease of apricot and grape and occasionally affects cherry. On newly infected hosts generally the first symptoms of Eutypa dieback are foliage that fades in color, is undersized, and wilts on individual branches during spring or summer. Limbs die back and dead leaves commonly remain attached through the winter. The disease is progressive and if not effectively managed an increasing number of limbs die over time. Eventually the entire plant can be killed. Eutypa dieback is most serious in coastal growing areas because weather there favors dispersal and infection of the fungus. Eutypa dieback also occurs at inland growing areas, such as San Joaquin and Yolo counties. The disease is more important in older hosts because they have more pruning wounds, and infections and dieback accumulate over time.",
        "solutions": "Prune apricots and cherries only during July and August in inland areas and during August near the coast. This can allow wounded tissue to no longer be susceptible to infection before the rainy season arrives. If hosts must be pruned outside of summertime, flaming wounds with a propane torch for 5 to 10 seconds after making the cut can cause the wound to become immune to infection by Eutypa spores. In grapes, which are commonly pruned during winter, delaying pruning to as late as possible in the dormant season (February or later) reduces the risk of infection. Sanitation can help limit the pathogen's spread. Prune off infected limbs during summer. Make cuts at least 1 foot below the site of any canker. Make sure no discolored, diseased wood remains below the cut. If wood is discolored, make another cut further down the limb. Dispose of infected wood away from hosts, such as at a landfill. Provide plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care, such as fertilization if warranted and especially appropriate irritation to promote vigorous growth. Hosts stressed from drought or other poor growing conditions appear more extensively affected by this disease. If hosts are sprinkler irrigated, direct the spray low enough so that limbs are not wetted or use deflectors to prevent wetting of host wood. Painting or spraying fresh pruning wounds with the fungicides myclobutanil or thiophanate-methyl can reduce the risk of wound infection by Eutypa lata. When pruning is done during the summer, fungicide treatment is generally not warranted.

        "description": "Broad mite and cyclamen mite are types of thread-footed mites (family Tarsonemidae) so named because of the long, thin appendage on the adults' rear legs.",
        "identification": "Because of their tiny size, their damage symptoms as described below are generally the first and only obvious clue that thread-footed mites are present. Note that similar damage symptoms can be caused by adverse growing conditions, certain nutrient deficiencies (e.g., boron or zinc deficiency), and injury from herbicides including 2,4,-D, other broadleaf herbicides, and glyphosate. Broad mite and cyclamen mite adult females are about 1/100 inch (0.25 mm) long, about one-fourth the size of spider mites. Males are about one-half the length of females. Thread-footed mites cannot be seen without a microscope or at least a 20\u00d7 hand lens. Adults have 4 pairs of legs and immatures have 3 pairs. Broad mites are oval shaped and commonly translucent to amber, greenish, or yellowish. Adult females have a white stripe down the center of their back. Broad mites have a tapered body that is widest between their second pair of legs and narrower toward the rear. Broad mite eggs have rows of tiny pale pegs protruding from the upper surface. Cyclamen mite adults can be pale yellow, pinkish orange, or translucent white. The sides of their body are nearly parallel, not sharply tapered as with broad mite. Cyclamen mite eggs are pale, smooth ovals about one-half the length of adults.",
        "life_cycle": "Cyclamen and broad mites develop through 4 life stages: egg, larva, nymph, and adult. An adult female broad mite lays about 20 eggs during her lifetime. Broad mite is most abundant under warm, humid conditions. Egg to adult development time is about 6 to 10 days when temperatures are warm. An adult female cyclamen mite lays about 12 to 20 eggs during her lifetime. Cyclamen mite does best under cool, humid or moist conditions. Egg to adult development time is 5 to 21 days, the shorter at warmer temperatures.",
        "damage": "Broad mites and cyclamen mites in California primarily infest and damage herbaceous ornamentals. While feeding they inject plant parts with a toxic saliva. Infested leaves become cupped, curled, dwarfed, and thickened. Leaves or flowers may become bronzed or otherwise discolored and stiff. Infested buds deform, discolor, or drop. Internodes may be short, giving plants a stunted or tufted appearance. Damage does not become apparent until sometime after the mite feeding when plant tissues expand and grow. Broad mite in California is primarily a pest in greenhouses and ornamental nurseries. Hosts of broad mites include African violet, azalea, begonia, chrysanthemum, dahlia, Exacum, gerbera, impatiens, ivy, peppers, rhododendron, and zinnia. Lemons grown near the coast and sporadically caneberries are also hosts. On coastal lemons broad mites can be abundant from late July through early October, especially on trees with Argentine ants. Broad mites on lemons often occur with citrus rust mites. The citrus rust mite (family Eriophyidae) is usually the more abundant species. Feeding of both of these mites discolors lemon rinds causing fruit to discolor and appear scabby with shallow cracks. Cyclamen mite hosts include African violet, alyssum, azalea, begonia, bouvardia, carnation, chrysanthemum, cyclamen, dahlia, Exacum, fuchsia, geranium, gerbera, gloxinia, impatiens, ivy, ixia, kalanchoe, larkspur, Marguerite daisy, peppers, petunia, pouch flower, rhododendron, schefflera, snapdragon, strawberry, and verbena.",
        "solutions": "Amblyseius and Neoseiulus species predatory mites and sixspotted thrips provide biological control of broad mites in some situations. That naturally occurring predators can sometimes be important is indicated by the pest mites being more common when Argentine ants that disrupt biological control are present. These predaceous mites are commercially available and sometimes released in greenhouses. To allow natural enemies to be potentially effective, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose-off plants), and avoid the application of miticides and broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Natural Enemy Releases for Biological Control of Crop Pests and Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Establish new plantings from mite-free stock. Avoid planting uninfested hosts near infested plants. Regularly inspect plants and disinfest or dispose of them if their appearance or growth is unacceptable. Broad and cyclamen mites are difficult to control with pesticides. They are protected from sprays by their habit of feeding in buds or within distorted tissue. By the time tissue grows and damage becomes apparent, the mites may no longer be present or causing damage. Where broad mites or cyclamen mites have been problems and pesticides will be applied, it may be best to delay application until the next growing season and spray terminals as new growth develops. Potentially effective miticides available to home gardeners include horticultural oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, and wettable sulfur. Effective products available only to professional pesticide applicators include abamectin and fenpyroximate.

Only the larval stage chews plants. Although adults consume only liquids, such as nectar and water, they are important because they choose which plants to lay eggs on. Larvae have three pairs of legs on the thorax (the area immediately behind the head) and leglike appendages on some, but not all, segments of the abdomen.",

        "life_cycle": "Moths and butterflies have complete metamorphosis and develop through four life stages. Adults have prominent, delicate wings covered with tiny scales that rub off and appear powdery when touched. After mating, the female moth or butterfly lays her eggs singly or in a mass on or near the host plant or nearby soil. Eggs usually hatch in several days. The emerging larvae move singly or in groups to feeding sites on the plant. Most caterpillars eat voraciously and grow rapidly. Some feed almost continuously. Others, such as cutworm larvae, hide in the soil during the day, emerging to feed at night. Caterpillars shed their old skins about five times before entering a nonactive pupal stage. Some species pupate in silken cocoons, and most species pupate in a characteristic location, such as on the host plant or in litter beneath the plant. The adult moth or butterfly emerges from the pupal case after several days to several months, depending on the species and season. Some common caterpillars have only one generation per year outdoors; other species have several generations each year and can cause damage throughout the growing season. ",
        "damage": "Caterpillars chew irregular holes in foliage or blossoms or entirely consume seedlings, young shoots, buds, leaves, or flowers. Some caterpillars fold or roll leaves together with silk to form shelters. Caterpillar feeding can kill or retard the growth of young plants.",
        "solutions": "Handpick. Eliminate nearby weeds, which may host caterpillars. Provide proper cultural care to allow older plants to outgrow and replace any damaged tissue after infestations are controlled. Applications of Bacillus thuringiensis or spinosad can be effective against larvae, especially when caterpillars are small.

Adult bulb flies look like small bumble bees and may also resemble other beneficial species. On warm sunny days, adults often hover around blooming plants, where they feed on pollen and nectar. Bulb fly larvae are plump, wrinkled, dirty yellow, gray, white, or brownish maggots with a short brown or blackish breathing tube at their rear. Maggots of several species of flies infest bulbs of all types, including daffodil, iris, lily, and tulip. ",

        "life_cycle": "The adult lays an egg in spring or summer on exposed bulbs or stems at or near the base of plants. After 5 to 14 days, the egg hatches and a larva wriggles down into the soil or moves down along the outside of the bulb. It feeds on the bottom of the bulb where the roots emerge then enters and feeds inside the bulb. The larva develops through three instars over a period of 9 to 10 months. In spring the larva pupates in a brownish case inside the bulb, or it emerges and pupates nearby in topsoil. Pupation takes 4 to 8 weeks, after which the adult emerges, mates, and females lay eggs. Adults live about 2 to 3 weeks.",

        "description": "Adults are flightless and dull gray, blackish, or brown, 0.13 to 0.38 inch long, with curved snouts and elbow-shaped antennae. Because they feed at night and often hide in litter during the day, adult beetles are often not observed. Larvae are whitish, pinkish, or green grubs that live in soil and feed on roots or crowns. Mature larvae are up to 0.38 inch long, C-shaped, and legless. ",
        "identification": "There are more than 1,000 species of weevils or snout beetles in California. The most common pest weevil species in California is the black vine weevil, Otiorhynchus sulcatus. Other important species include the cribrate weevil, Otiorhynchus cribricollis, fuller rose beetle, Asynonychus godmoni, obscure root weevil, Sciopithes obscurus, strawberry root weevil, Otiorhynchus ovatus, vegetable weevil, Listroderes costirostris, the woods weevil, Nemocestes incomptus, the rough strawberry root weevil, O. rugosotriatus, and the Douglas-fir twig weevil, Cylindrocopturus furnissi.",
        "life_cycle": "Peak adult weevil populations occur in summer and early fall, and some may overwinter. Female weevils may feed for an extended period before laying eggs, and many species produce viable eggs without mating. Eggs are laid in soil near the base of plants about 4 to 6 weeks after adults have emerged. A single female may lay as many as 500 eggs. Eggs hatch into legless, white grubs that feed on roots. The larvae develop in soil through 6 instars over a period of 2 to 8 months. They are whitish grubs with a brown head and commonly have a C-shaped posture. Black vine weevil overwinters primarily as a late-instar larva. A few individuals of this and other species can overwinter as adults. Weevils overwintering as late instars form pupae in spring. Adult weevils emerge in late spring or summer and feed on the foliage of host plants at night. Adults do not fly, but may crawl into new plantings from nearby native plants, ornamentals, blackberries, or second-year strawberries",
        "damage": "Adults generally feed on foliage. Leaves appear notched or ragged and may be clipped from twigs. The most serious damage is done by larvae, which feed on roots and can destroy root hairs and chew the bark and cortex off larger roots. Some may tunnel into the crown and destroy crown tissue. In herbaceous plants, damage is usually first seen as wilting and dying plants in a localized area of the garden. ",
        "solutions": "Destroy adults to prevent more serious damage. Grow species or cultivars that are less susceptible to weevil damage, and avoid replanting susceptible crops at infested sites. Grow older plants that are more likely to be infested away from younger plants susceptible to weevils. Provide cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate damage. Check roots before planting to make sure they are free from larvae. On trees, trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material to trunks to prevent flightless beetles from feeding on foliage. On strawberries, destroy all affected plants, then move outward in a circular pattern, removing plants (even if they are healthy looking) that are infested with larvae and pupae until you no longer find weevils. Replant if necessary after working the soil well and solarizing or treating with commercially available parasitic nematodes when larvae or pupae are expected to be present (in midsummer to fall). Soil must be warm and moist. Trapping adults may help or you can apply a barrier around the bed made of tarpaper and coated with Stickem or Tanglefoot about 18 inches high and buried 2 to 3 inches into the soil to keep adults out. No effective insecticides are available for larvae.",

Avoid injuring bulbs during digging, handling or storage. Injuries promote attack by diseases and mites. If storing bulbs, examine them carefully for signs of mites and disease. Rapid crop rotation fosters the survival of mites on leftover vegetation. After harvest, clear all vegetation to allow organic matter to decompose; this reduces populations of the mite.

        "description": "Bacterial soft rots affect many plants including begonia, carnation, daffodil, geranium, impatiens, and zinnia. Soft rot bacteria cause infected tissue to turn brown, become mushy, and develop an unpleasant odor. Stem tissue turns brown and deteriorates near the soil. Plants grow slowly and seedlings collapse. Bacterial spots often start out as tiny water-soaked areas on leaves, stems, or blossoms. Spots or blotches turn dark gray or blackish as they enlarge and sometimes have yellow borders. Initial spots are circular but may become angular and coalesce and cause plant tissue death or necrosis. Cankers may form on stems. Under wet conditions, infected tissue may exude brownish masses of bacteria. Dead tissue may tear out, leaving holes and a ragged appearance. Pathogens causing spots, blights, and soft rots can also cause vascular wilt if the infecting bacteria become systemic. Aboveground plant parts yellow, droop, wilt, and die. ",

        "description": "A malformation of plant stems commonly appearing as enlargement and flattening as if several stems were fused is called fasciation. Unusual growth, such as a spur on cherry fruit, can also be considered fasciation. An abnormal, swollen flattening and twisting of stems is a common manifestation of fasciation. Small stems or leaves growing from the distorted stems can be abnormally abundant and undersized. Terminal growth can be atypically dense and tuftlike, called a witches' broom. For more photographs see Fascinating Fasciation (PDF). The bacterium Rhodococcus fascians is the cause of at least some infectious fasciations. Fasciation bacteria survive on infected plants and debris and spread in water to infect plants through wounds. Certain viruses may be the cause of some infectious fasciations. Some fasciations are noninfectious, possibly caused by a genetic disorder. The cause of many fasciations has not been identified. Fasciation causes stems to be atypically flat, thick, and twisted. Foliage terminal to the abnormal stem may have atypically short internodes causing foliage to be dense and tuftlike. Hosts more commonly affected by fasciation include alyssum, aster, carnation, Chinese pistache, chrysanthemum, geranium, impatiens, Marguerite daisy, nasturtium, petunia, primrose, smoke tree, and snapdragon. Fasciation rarely threatens the survival of established woody plants. Most fasciations consist only of aesthetic damage and the malady is relatively uncommon. However, plant parts fasciated because of infection by the R. fascians bacterium may die prematurely. Obtain new plants from a quality supplier known to provide pathogen-free plants. To help prevent the spread and damage of the fasciation bacterium, avoid injuring plants such as by excessive pruning especially when plants are wet. Keep the basal trunk as dry as feasible; for example, keep mulch back from the basal stem or trunk and redirect or shield irrigation sprinklers so trunk bases are not wetted. Use good sanitation, such as dispose of diseased plants and plant debris in covered containers. Keep plant-care equipment, hands, and tools clean. To control fasciation due to all likely causes (genetic and microbial), prune off and dispose of distorted tissue. Do not propagate or graft symptomatic plants. Clean cutting tools after clipping off fasciated plant parts.

        "description": "Chrysanthemums and daisy, Chrysanthemum spp., are susceptible to brown rust, Puccinia chrysanthemi, and white rust, Puccinia horiana. Brown rust is common where chrysanthemums are grown outdoors. White rust has been the target of eradication and quarantine programs, which may require the destruction of infected Chrysanthemum spp. Chrysanthemum white rust fungus causes brownish, pinkish, pale buff, or white spore-producing pustules on the underside of leaves. Brown rust does not produce raised pustules on the leaf underside; its dark brown spores occur in powdery masses. Both brown and white rusts distort, discolor, and cause premature drop of leaves in chrysanthemums. Infection causes pale green, yellow, or white spots on the upper surface of leaves, and both of these rusts and other causes can produce similar leaf spotting. Chrysanthemum white rust is distinguished by the presence of its pustules. Chrysanthemum white rust has a very short life cycle and only two spore stages. The pathogen reproduces only on living chrysanthemum foliage. Teliospores develop on the underside of infected leaves and germinate in the leaf pustules, producing basidiospores. The basidiospores move with air and if they land on chrysanthemum foliage that is wet, cause a new infection. Both brown rust and white rust of chrysanthemum are favored by the same conditions (cool temperatures and damp weather or high humidity). Where white rust occurs, it causes damage primarily in greenhouses. White rust usually is not damaging outdoors because direct sunlight and low humidity destroy the white rust basidiospores. However, white rust can survive outdoors where temperatures are mild and humidity is high. Residential and outdoor chrysanthemum plantings in coastal areas of California can serve as a reservoir of infection that is difficult to eliminate. When infection spreads from outdoors to chrysanthemums in greenhouses, crops can be devastated. Report any suspected white rust infections to the county agricultural commissioner. To avoid the disease, plant nonhost species, including pyrethrum, or painted daisy, Chrysanthemum coccineum, and Shasta daisy, C. maximum. Where brown rust is a problem, avoid overhead watering. Collect fallen infected leaves and dispose of them away from host plants. Fungicides applied in the spring can prevent or reduce brown rust disease. However, the frequent applications required to provide good rust control may not be warranted in many landscape situations. ",

More commonly, plants cannot adequately absorb the zinc that is present because of an adverse soil environment or inappropriate cultural practices. Example causes of zinc deficiency include soil that is abnormally high in organic matter or sand or high in pH. Unhealthy roots (e.g., from crushing or other physical injury, soil-dwelling nematodes, or root decay pathogens) and poor irrigation practices (e.g., overwatering and waterlogging) can also cause plants to develop zinc deficiency symptoms. In broadleaves mildly deficient in zinc, leaves are uniformly yellowish or pale between the veins and may develop dead spots. Symptoms are usually most apparent on new foliage in the spring. Severely deficient plants bloom and leaf out late, sometimes several weeks later than normal. When buds open, leaves are atypically pointed, narrow, undersized, and yellowish. Internodes are often shortened, resulting in tufts of leaves (rosettes, or witches\u2019 brooms). Older leaves may drop prematurely. Symptoms of zinc deficiency commonly resemble those of iron deficiency, manganese deficiency, or herbicide phytotoxicity from exposure to glyphosate or preemergence herbicides. Zinc-deficient conifers have undersized, yellowish needles that may drop prematurely. When plants are severely affected, branches are undersized and may die back.

        "description": "Iron deficiency symptoms are common in California landscapes even though sufficient iron is present in most soils.",
        "identification": "Azaleas, citrus, gardenias, rhododendrons, and other plants that are adapted to acidic soil are especially prone to iron deficiency when soil pH is above about 7.5 (alkaline). Iron deficiency is also common when soils are cool, high in calcium, poorly drained, or waterlogged and when root health is impaired by root decay pathogens, nematodes, or other biological or physical causes. Iron deficiency in broadleaves causes young foliage to be bleached, chlorotic, or pale between distinctly green veins. Fading appears first around leaf margins, then spreads inward until only the veins are green on younger foliage. When severe, young leaves remain undersized, turn almost white, and develop black or brown spots, margins, and tips. Twigs may die back and leaves may drop prematurely. In iron-deficient conifers, newer needles are commonly undersized, and the upper canopy becomes chlorotic while older, lower canopy foliage remains green. In iron-deficient palms, new leaves typically are uniformly yellow. Tissue analysis may not be reliable for diagnosing iron deficiency for plants in the landscape. Diagnose this malady based on foliage symptoms and knowledge of existing cultural practices and soil conditions and whether iron deficiency is common in that plant species. Soil tests can be useful, for example if they reveal high pH or low organic matter content. Recognize that certain preemergence herbicides and manganese deficiency cause similar damage symptoms. Iron and manganese deficiency have mostly the same causes and remedies.",
        "life_cycle": "",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "Remedy iron deficiency primarily by improving cultural practices and the soil environment. To improve aeration and reduce waterlogging, increase the interval between irrigations to the maximum extent that still provides adequate moisture to maintain plant health. If plants are small, consider digging them up and replanting them on a broad berm or mound of soil raised several inches to improve drainage. Amend soils to improve drainage, lower pH, and increase organic matter before planting or replanting species adapted to acidic soils. If soil is alkaline, about 6 months before planting add 1 to 4 pounds of elemental sulfur per 100 square feet of soil surface. Mix or rototill the sulfur into the top 6 inches of soil and irrigate. Use the lower amount in sandier soils and the higher amount in soils high in clay. Around established plants use a soil probe or an auger to create holes around the drip line, then fill the holes with soil mixed with 2 to 3 teaspoons of elemental sulfur. Bacteria slowly convert sulfur to sulfuric acid; this lowers soil pH and increases iron availability slowly over months when soil is moist, warm, and well aerated. Acidification is not effective if soil is high in calcium carbonate as discussed in pH problems. Alternatively, before planting, add acidic sphagnum peat or organic matter that has been well composted; mix it into the top 1 to 2 feet of soil at a rate not exceeding 20% of soil volume. Be aware that amended soils will settle as organic matter decomposes, causing new plants to settle in the planting hole and become subject to root and crown decay. When planting in amended soil, compost organic matter well before use, form soil into a broad mound, place the root ball on solid soil, and plant about 1/2 to 2 inches or more above the native soil line. Another remedy is to apply iron chelate according to the product label, such as by spraying foliage. If used, apply chelate in combination with measures to improve the plant\u2019s culture, environment, and soil conditions. Iron is also applied by trunk injections, but injections injure trunks and may mechanically spread plant pathogens. If applying inorganic fertilizers, switch from nitrate- to ammonium-based compounds, such as ammonium nitrate, which gradually lowers soil pH. Regularly place composted organic matter as mulch on top of the roots of established plants. This eventually (slowly) remedies iron deficiency as organic matter decays and soil becomes more acidic. Mulching provides many benefits in addition to increasing nutrient availability. See \"Soil and Fertilizer Management\" in the California Master Gardener Handbook for more information.

        "description": "Plants require certain mineral elements for healthy growth. Potassium is one of the most important along with nitrogen and phosphorus. For most plants adequate potassium naturally occurs in soils. In California potassium deficiency is common in palms and otherwise generally occurs only in fruit and nut trees grown in sandy soils and plants growing in containers or planter boxes.",
        "identification": "All palm species are susceptible to potassium deficiency. Symptoms always appear first in older leaves and eventually progress into younger leaves, but symptoms otherwise vary among palm species. The most common symptom is yellow or orangish flecks or spots on older leaves, which appear translucent when discoloring is observed from the leaf underside. In some species, yellowing begins at the leaf margins or tips and leaves gradually become entirely yellow, then brown and withered. Leaf midribs may be yellow instead of their normal green. Potassium deficiency in broadleaves causes leaves to turn yellow and then brown at the tips and margins and between veins. Older leaves are affected first and can entirely discolor, crinkle, curl, roll along edges, or die and drop prematurely. In potassium-deficient conifers, older foliage turns dark blue-green, progressing to yellow then reddish brown. Needles are often undersized with brown, dead tips. Except for fruit and nut trees in sandy soils, palms, and plants growing in containers or planter boxes, potassium deficiency symptoms are usually not due to insufficient potassium in soil. Symptoms in other plants and situations are generally due to adverse soil conditions and anything that injures roots or restricts root growth, thereby limiting nutrient uptake. Common causes of deficiency symptoms include aeration deficit, compaction, high soil pH (especially with plants adapted to acidic soil), inappropriate irrigation, mechanical (physical) injury to roots, poor drainage (waterlogging), root decay pathogens, and root-feeding nematodes. Some sucking insects, foliar pathogens (e.g., diamond scale fungus of palms), and preemergence herbicides cause similar damage symptoms. Diagnose potassium deficiency based on visual symptoms, plant susceptibility (e.g., container plants, fruit and nut trees in sandy soil, palms), and the presence of soil conditions that favor deficiency (high leaching, sandy soil, sparse topsoil).",
        "life_cycle": "",
        "damage": "",
        "solutions": "To correct a deficiency, spread organic mulch beneath plants and apply potassium fertilizer, preferably slow-release forms such as potassium silicate or sulfur- or polymer-coated potassium products. Potassium sulfate may be used, and potassium will be held by organic matter and clay particles. Especially with sandy soils, avoid readily leached materials (e.g., potassium nitrate and potassium sulfate). Potassium nitrate may also cause an excess of nitrogen unless nitrogen deficiency is also a problem. Do not use potassium chloride where chlorine or salt toxicity are problems. Because a high potassium concentration reduces magnesium availability, and excess magnesium makes potassium unavailable, it may be best to add both potassium and magnesium in combination if one of these is deficient. A slow-release fertilizer containing magnesium and a 3-1-3 ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium is good for palms. Symptomatic palm foliage will not recover, and you must wait for new growth. To avoid aggravating potassium deficiency, do not remove symptomatic leaves until they have turned entirely brown. Fertilizers commonly contain nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) listed as NPK on the fertilizer label. Except when growing palms or where soil is highly leached or very sandy, soil around landscape trees and shrubs is rarely deficient in all three elements. Adding sufficient complete fertilizer to provide the deficient element can result in an excess of other nutrients and may contribute to salinity problems and pollute water. Established woody plants should be fertilized in response to specific needs. Complete fertilizers are generally not recommended for woody landscape plants, except for palms and possibly other woody monocots (plants with a single seed leaf). Also avoid products containing both fertilizer and pesticide. See \"Soil and Fertilizer Management\" in the California Master Gardener Handbook for more information.

Boron and other specific ions (most commonly chloride and sodium) can be toxic to plants even when overall salt measures, such as electrical conductivity (EC) and total dissolved solids (TDS) as discussed in Nutrient and Mineral Excesses, Salinity, and Salt Toxicity, are within acceptable limits. Toxicity symptoms of specific ions are difficult to distinguish from each other and from symptoms of overall high salinity or water deficit.",
        "identification": "Typical symptoms of toxicity from exposure to excess boron or other ions are yellowing of leaf margins and tips and sometimes between veins. Symptoms progress to necrosis (browning) and premature drop of foliage. In many plants, boron accumulates in older foliage, causing the margins or tips of leaves and needles to turn yellow, then brown or blackish. In certain plants (e.g., cotoneaster, gardenia, privet, pyracantha, rhaphiolepis, and syringa) boron accumulates mostly in new terminal growth and symptoms of toxicity appear in young, expanding foliage. In apple, pear, and stone fruits and other Prunus spp., boron toxicity symptoms appear in young, expanding foliage. Symptoms can include misshapen fruit and cankering and dieback of petioles and young twigs. In any plant, excess boron can cause bark to crack or become corky. Severely affected plants can die. High concentrations of boron, chloride, and sodium occur naturally in soils and water in the situations described in Nutrient and Mineral Excesses, Salinity, and Salt Toxicity and this table. Ammonium toxicity can occur after excess application of ammonium fertilizers or incorporation of soil amendments high in ammonium, such as certain manures. Diagnose specific ion toxicity based on the visual symptoms in plants, knowledge of locations where those ion concentrations are high, and ion-specific laboratory tests of soil, water, or both.

        "description": "The pH (hydrogen ion concentration) of soil affects the form and availability of nutrients and the ability of roots to absorb nutrients and water. Nutrient deficiency or toxicity symptoms commonly develop when plants grow in soil with unfavorable pH. The activity of beneficial soil microorganisms (e.g., nitrifying bacteria) also depends partly on pH. A scale from 0 to 14 is used to express pH. A pH of 7.0 is neutral. Lower numbers represent increasingly acidic conditions. Higher numbers indicate increasingly alkaline (basic) conditions. Because a negative logarithmic scale is used, ten times as many positively charged hydrogen ions are available at a pH 6 than at pH 7. For optimal nutrient availability for plant growth, a good range of soil pH for most gardens and landscapes is 6.0 to 7.5.",
        "identification": "High pH is common in California soils. Because soil pH affects nutrient availability to roots, the primary symptoms of adverse soil pH are similar to those that can occur from nutrient deficiencies or excesses (toxicities). High pH causes interveinal chlorosis and bleaching, pale mottling, and blotchy or marginal necrosis of new growth. Damage is primarily due to reduced availability of minerals, especially iron, manganese, and zinc, so any of the symptoms of those deficiencies may occur in high-pH soils. If soil pH is below about 5.5, new foliage becomes chlorotic, distorted, and possibly necrotic. Plant growth slows. In severe cases affected roots can become discolored, short, and stubby. Symptoms result primarily from aluminum toxicity and deficiencies of calcium and magnesium. Copper and manganese toxicity and phosphorus deficiency symptoms may also occur. Acidic soils occur mostly in conifer forests and regions with high average rainfall. Low pH is also common in exposed subsoils in the Coastal Range westward to the Pacific Ocean, mostly due to soil cuts and grading during development.",

        "solutions": "Determine if soil pH is not favorable to plant growth using knowledge of local soil conditions and the existing plant species\u2019 susceptibility to unfavorable pH. Especially test the pH of soil from the root zone. If sodic soils (soils high in sodium) are suspected, obtain a value for sodium adsorption ratio (SAR) and a separate test of calcium carbonate (percent lime), as discussed below in \"buffering capacity.\" Where soil falls outside the desirable range of pH 6 to 7.5, grow species tolerant of the pH at that site. To learn what landscape plants grow in acidic soils (e.g., in California\u2019s North Coast) versus alkaline and sodic soils (many arid locations) consult resources such as Abiotic Disorders of Landscape Plants and The New Sunset Western Garden Book. To raise pH in the few landscape locations where pH is too low, mix appropriate amounts of finely ground limestone into soil before planting (soil tests can provide specific rate recommendations) or fertilize with calcium nitrate. To lower pH, mix elemental sulfur, iron sulfate, and organic matter into topsoil. Apply mulch and when nitrogen application is warranted, use acidifying fertilizers such as ammonium sulfate. Follow the other management practices described under \"Solutions\" in Iron Deficiency and Nutrient and Mineral Excesses, Salinity, or Salt Toxicity. Buffering capacity. The ability of soil to resist changes in pH is called buffering capacity. Soils\u2019 response to acidifying amendments is usually estimated by measuring calcium carbonate (percent free lime). The calcium carbonate measurement indicates the amount of acidifying amendments or fertilizers needed to lower the pH. When calcium carbonate is low, the pH of soil more readily changes after the application of certain fertilizers or other amendments (e.g., sulfur) that make the soil more acidic. If calcium carbonate is high, the pH tends to stay high. If both pH and calcium carbonate are high in soil, it is difficult to lower soil pH sufficiently to grow certain plants. Only species more tolerant of high pH may grow there. Acidic soils with high buffering capacity can resist the effects of adding lime or limestone to raise pH. Raising pH is not usually needed for California soils, but may be required for plants where soil pH is naturally low or has been lowered by agricultural practices or development.

        "description": "Plants require certain mineral elements for healthy growth. Nitrogen along with phosphorus and potassium are the most important. Most plants are supplied adequate nitrogen from decomposing organic matter, irrigation water, and soil. The atmosphere supplies nitrogen that soil microbes convert into forms usable by plant roots. Conversely, applying excess nitrogen can damage plants and pollute the environment.",
        "identification": "Slow growth and uniform yellowing of older leaves are usually the first symptoms of nitrogen (N) deficiency. Nitrogen-deficient plants produce smaller than normal fruit, leaves, and shoots and these can develop later than normal. Broadleaf foliage in fall may be more reddish than normal and drop prematurely. Nitrogen deficiency in stone fruits causes yellowing and reddening of leaves or red spotting at top of tree prior to when fall color normally develops. Nitrogen-deficient conifers may develop few or no side branches. Lower canopy needles may be abnormally close together, short, and yellowish, while the upper canopy appears normal. Nitrogen-deficient palms develop a color gradation, with the oldest leaves being most chlorotic and completely yellow or whitish in severe cases. Most garden and landscape plants do not require nitrogen application for good growth. Exceptions include fruit and nut trees, palms, roses, and certain other profusely blossoming shrubs. Nitrogen fertilization might be needed for plants growing in soils amended with large amounts of undecomposed organic matter or soil that is highly leached, very sandy, or in containers or planter boxes. Visual symptoms (e.g., uniform yellowing of older foliage) strongly suggest nitrogen deficiency. To help confirm nitrogen deficiency, laboratory analysis of properly collected soil samples can be useful but difficult to interpret. Trees have a relatively large root system and nitrogen availability varies with soil conditions, which can change over short time periods. Leaf analysis can be obtained, but there are no guidelines for appropriate nitrogen levels in most ornamentals, although conifer and broadleaf foliage typically has 1 to 3% total nitrogen. If testing foliage you may want to obtain separate leaf analyses on current-season foliage of unhealthy and healthy plants of same species growing nearby and compare the tests\u2019 results. If testing soil you may want to take separate samples for comparison from areas with plants that appear healthy and unhealthy. First contact the plant diagnostic laboratory to learn the proper methods of sample collection and submission.",

        "solutions": "If you determine that nitrogen application is needed, use the correct type, rate, and method of fertilization for that situation. Inappropriate fertilization can damage plants and cause other problems discussed in nitrogen excess. Nitrogen is commonly provided to plants as organic matter (e.g., organic mulch that slowly decomposes) or as inorganic compounds (e.g., ammonium nitrate or ammonium sulfate). Commercial slow-release fertilizers (e.g., sulfur- or polymer-coated urea) provide the easy handling of synthetic fertilizers but also slow-release characteristics. Although more expensive than other preparations, these can be a good choice for adding nitrogen to deficient soils. Fertilizers commonly contain nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), listed as NPK on the fertilizer label. Except when growing palms and possibly other woody monocots (plants with a single seed leaf) or when soil is highly leached or very sandy, soil around landscape trees and shrubs is rarely deficient in all three of these elements. Adding sufficient complete fertilizer to provide the deficient element can result in an excess of the other nutrients and may contribute to salinity problems and pollute water. In most situations avoid the application of complete fertilizers and also avoid products containing both fertilizer and pesticide. Fertilize established woody plants according to their specific needs. See \"Soil and Fertilizer Management\" in the California Master Gardener Handbook for more information.

It also occurs when plants grow in adverse soils, such as soil that is alkaline (high in pH) because high pH reduces manganese availability to roots. Manganese deficiency also occurs where soil is compacted or poorly drained, which causes aeration deficit and impedes roots ability to take up nutrients. ",
        "identification": "In manganese-deficient palms new leaves are uniformly chlorotic with necrotic streaks. Younger leaves remain smaller than older fronds. As manganese deficiency worsens, emerging new leaves and older leaves become distorted, necrotic, and withered, giving palm canopies a scorched, shriveled, undersized appearance. Manganese deficiency in broadleaves causes new leaves to be yellow to whitish with relatively wide, green areas along the veins. On severely affected leaves, brown dead spots develop between veins. Leaf margins may become crinkled, curled, or wavy, and shoot growth can be reduced. In conifers, manganese deficiency symptoms closely resemble iron deficiency. New needles are stunted and chlorotic, while older, lower-canopy foliage remains green. Phytotoxicity from preemergence herbicides causes similar symptoms but primarily damages older leaves first, while manganese deficiency symptoms occur mostly in newer leaves. Manganese deficiency symptoms closely resemble iron deficiency and any differences are too variable and unreliable to visually distinguish these maladies.",
