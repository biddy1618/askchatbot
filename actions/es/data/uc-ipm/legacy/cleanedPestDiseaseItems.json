    "description": "Most flowers are susceptible to infection by one or more plant viruses. Viruses can slow plant growth and change the appearance of foliage, flowers, and fruits. Virus-infected leaves can become spotted, streaked, mottled, distorted, or stunted. Veins may lose their color or develop outgrowths. Flowers can be dwarfed, deformed, streaked, or faded, or they can remain green or develop into leaflike structures. Viruses usually infect through a wound. Many are transmitted by invertebrates, such as aphids and thrips, that feed on plant juices. Mites, nematodes and fungi can also transmit viruses. Viruses can spread in vegetative plant parts, such as cuttings from infected stock plants and in bulbs, corms, and rhizomes. Identification Solutions Viruses rarely kill woody plants, but can dramatically alter plant appearance, reducing the value. Herbaceous ornamentals and certain vegetables are generally more susceptible to serious injury or death from viruses, especially when plants are young. Most plants infected with a virus cannot be cured. Dig out and destroy virus-infected plants. Prevent spreading viruses by using good sanitation and cultural practices. Control nearby weeds that serve as reservoirs for viruses and insects. Use only virus-free plant material and consider growing virus-resistant cultivars if available.",

    "life_cycle": "The fungus that causes clubroot persists in soil for many years. Infection is favored by acid soils with adequate moisture, but infections can occur above pH 7.0. In the presence of host plant roots, spores germinate and release swimming spores, called zoospores. These zoospores infect and colonize root hairs. Later, a second type of zoospore appears that can infect the main roots. Infection and colonization by this second zoospore causes the galling and clubbing of roots. Additional spores are formed inside the galled roots and are released into the soil when roots decay. The fungus is dispersed by the movement of infected plants, especially transplants, and the movement of soil.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Clubroot is most common in acid soils. Add lime annually to affected soils below pH 7.2. Provide good drainage. Minimize the spread of the pathogen by using pathogen-free transplants. Avoid planting plants where other infested plants in the mustard family have grown, such as broccoli and cabbage. Solarization will also give control.",

    "description": "Chrysanthemums and daisy, Chrysanthemum spp., are susceptible to brown rust, Puccinia chrysanthemi, and white rust, Puccinia horiana. Brown rust is common where chrysanthemums are grown outdoors. White rust has been the target of eradication and quarantine programs, which may require the destruction of infected Chrysanthemum spp. Identification Chrysanthemum white rust fungus causes brownish, pinkish, pale buff, or white spore-producing pustules on the underside of leaves. Brown rust does not produce raised pustules on the leaf underside; its dark brown spores occur in powdery masses. Both brown and white rusts distort, discolor, and cause premature drop of leaves in chrysanthemums. Infection causes pale green, yellow, or white spots on the upper surface of leaves, and both of these rusts and other causes can produce similar leaf spotting. Chrysanthemum white rust is distinguished by the presence of its pustules. Life cycle Chrysanthemum white rust has a very short life cycle and only two spore stages. The pathogen reproduces only on living chrysanthemum foliage. Teliospores develop on the underside of infected leaves and germinate in the leaf pustules, producing basidiospores. The basidiospores move with air and if they land on chrysanthemum foliage that is wet, cause a new infection. Both brown rust and white rust of chrysanthemum are favored by the same conditions (cool temperatures and damp weather or high humidity). Damage Where white rust occurs, it causes damage primarily in greenhouses. White rust usually is not damaging outdoors because direct sunlight and low humidity destroy the white rust basidiospores. However, white rust can survive outdoors where temperatures are mild and humidity is high. Residential and outdoor chrysanthemum plantings in coastal areas of California can serve as a reservoir of infection that is difficult to eliminate. When infection spreads from outdoors to chrysanthemums in greenhouses, crops can be devastated. Solutions Report any suspected white rust infections to the county agricultural commissioner. To avoid the disease, plant nonhost species, including pyrethrum, or painted daisy, Chrysanthemum coccineum, and Shasta daisy, C. maximum. Where brown rust is a problem, avoid overhead watering. Collect fallen infected leaves and dispose of them away from host plants. Fungicides applied in the spring can prevent or reduce brown rust disease. However, the frequent applications required to provide good rust control may not be warranted in many landscape situations.",

    "description": "Armillaria root rot, also known as oak root fungus disease or shoestring disease, affects mostly woody plants but also affects certain herbaceous perennials, such as begonia, carnation, daffodil, dahlia, geranium, and peony. Armillaria infects and kills cambial tissue, causing major roots and the trunk near the ground to die.",
    "identification": "The first aboveground symptoms are often undersized, discolored, and prematurely dropping leaves. Branches die, often beginning near the tops of plants; on herbaceous hosts, stems become discolored and cankered. Eventually the entire plant can be killed. Armillaria forms characteristic white mycelial plaques that have a mushroomlike odor when fresh. Mycelia grow between the bark and wood on woody hosts and can grow through soft plant tissue and appear on the surface, especially with herbaceous hosts. Clusters of mushrooms may form at the base of infected woody plants. Black or dark reddish brown rootlike structures (rhizomorphs) are frequently attached to the surface of roots or the root crown. Dematophora root rot also causes white growths that may be confused with Armillaria, but Dematophora tends to occur in smaller patches and grows throughout the wood rather than just under the bark.",
    "life_cycle": "Armillaria thrives under moist conditions, for example when irrigated turf is planted around the roots of California native oaks. Plants become infected through root contact with infected plants or rhizomorphs attached to infected roots. Armillaria root rot can develop slowly, and symptoms may not appear until the fungus is well established. The fungus can survive for many years in dead or living tree roots.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Preventing infection of new plants and planting resistant species are the only effective controls for Armillaria. Prepare the site well. Remove old roots and debris from the soil before planting. Use pathogen-free plants and air-dry soil well before planting.

    "name": "Black vine weevil",
    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/blvinwee.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "The black vine weevil feeds on many garden and landscape plants. Hosts include azalea, caneberries, rhododendron, euonymus, grape, liquidambar, and strawberry.",
    "identification": "Adult weevils are hard-bodied, flightless, snout beetles (Curculionidae) about 1/2 inch long. They are black with small patches of white scales on the forewings. Adults have elbowed (sharply bent), clubbed antennae and their head and mouthparts are elongated. Adults spend the day hidden beneath loose bark, and in litter on the ground and topsoil. Adults emerge at night to chew and feed on foliage. Note that several other common weevils resemble black vine weevil and they have similar biology. Eggs are round and pale orangish. They occur in soil around the base of plants. Larvae are oblong and whitish to pale yellow with a brown head. They grow to about 1/2 inch long and occur hidden in soil, feeding on roots and the basal stem. Larvae are legless and when disturbed or exposed commonly have a C-shaped posture.",
    "life_cycle": "Black vine weevil develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Overwintering is primarily as late instars (older larvae) or prepupae. A few individuals may overwinter as adults. Weevils overwintering as late instars pupate in late winter to spring. Adult weevils emerge in spring and chew and feed on the foliage of host plants, mostly at night. Adults do not fly, but may walk to new plantings from nearby infested garden plants, ornamentals, and unmanaged vegetation. Peak adult populations and leaf chewing occur in summer and early fall. Female weevils feed for several weeks before laying eggs. About 4 weeks after adults emerge and begin chewing foliage, eggs are laid in soil near the base of plants. A single female can lay as many as 500 eggs. Eggs hatch into larvae that develop through 6, increasingly larger instars as they feed underground over a period of 8 to 10 months. There is generally 1 generation per year.",
    "damage": "Adults chew and feed on foliage. Host leaves or flowers can become notched or ragged, and leaves or needles may be clipped from twigs. Where bud break coincides with adult emergence, a high percentage of primary buds and new shoot tips may be consumed. The most serious plant damage is done by larvae, which chew on basal crowns and roots. Larval feeding can kill or weaken certain hosts, especially azalea and rhododendron. Feeding by larvae can also increase damage from root diseases such as Phytophthora root rot.",
    "solutions": "If planting azalea or rhododendron, select cultivars that are less susceptible to weevils. Check roots of new plants before planting to make sure they are free from larvae. Provide a good growing environment and proper cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate insect feeding. Handpick and destroy adults beginning in spring to reduce the later abundance of larvae and their feeding damage. For example, where leaf notching is observed, after nightfall shake or branch beat plant parts over a sheet or other collecting surface; gather and crush or dispose of any dislodged weevils. Trapping can reduce adult abundance. One strategy is to wrap trunks overnight with burlap or corrugated cardboard, then during the day remove and inspect wraps and dispose of any weevils that sought shelter there. Pitfall traps such as cups buried in soil near the base of plants can also be used. Trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material (e.g., Tanglefoot) to trunks to prevent the flightless beetles from climbing trunks to feed on foliage. First wrap the trunk several inches wide with landscape fabric or plastic, then apply the sticky material on top the wrap to avoid potential bark injury from the sticky material. Periodically replace wraps to prevent growth-restriction damage to trunks. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter or sandy) and not compacted. Apply nematodes when weevil larvae are expected to be present in midsummer to fall. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Soil must be warm (at least 60°F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. If damage has been intolerable, monitor plants in spring. About 1 week after adult chewing is first observed, spinosad can be sprayed on leaves in the evening; because of its short persistence, repeat application 7 to 10 days later may be warranted. If plants are especially susceptible to damage, a more persistent insecticide (e.g., carbaryl) can be applied. If weevil emergence is prolonged and new leaf chewing continues to appear, a second foliar spray may be made about 3 to 4 weeks after the first application. Applying a systemic insecticide such as imidacloprid to soil or trunks can control both adults and larvae.

    "description": "This flatheaded borer (family Buprestidae) infests only birch. It can cause dieback of limbs and death of entire trees. ",
    "identification": "Adult bronze birch borers are oblong, dark metallic, coppery beetles about 3/8 inch long. Their feeding causes inconspicuous chewing on leaf edges of alder, birch, and poplar. D-shaped, smooth-edged holes occur in bark where adults emerged after feeding and boring inside during their larval stage. Larvae occur hidden under bark. They are legless and pale with distinct segments and an enlarged head and grow up to 1/2 inch long. The many similar Agrilus species include bronze poplar borer (A. liragus), which infests Populus species (aspen, cottonwood, and poplar). Emerald ash borer (A. planipennis), which occurs in the eastern and midwestern United States, has killed millions of ash trees. For information on other Agrilus species see Guide to Insect Borers in North American Broadleaf Trees and Shrubs from the USDA Forest Service. Birch can also be infested with other boring insects. For information on these see Pest Notes: Bark Beetles and Pest Notes: Clearwing Moths.",
    "life_cycle": "Flatheaded borers develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adult females lay eggs in crevices and wounds of birch bark on sunny portions of limbs and trunks. The hatching larvae chew through bark and into phloem and xylem tissue, packing frass (excrement) in their tunnels as they feed and grow. Mature larvae tunnel in the outer sapwood, where they overwinter. In spring, larvae chew an oblong chamber beneath bark and pupate. Adults emerge in Northern California beginning in April, then mate and reproduce. There is one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Foliage of borer-infested trees turns pale green, yellow, and then brown. Leaves drop prematurely and scattered limbs die. Swollen ridges develop on branches and the trunk where larvae tunnel beneath bark. Liquid oozes from bark, creating stained blotches. Severely infested trees die prematurely.",
    "solutions": "To prevent infestations, provide trees with a good growing environment and proper cultural care. Birch require more water than most other trees, so good soil conditions, healthy roots, and appropriate irrigation are especially critical. Birch typically have an especially short life span in California in hot, dry interior areas; avoid planting birch where summers are dry and hot. To minimize problems with bronze birch borer: Do not plant birch where they will be exposed to heat stress, such as the south and west sides of buildings. Plant at the most suitable location, such as the east side of buildings where heat stress is typically less severe. Avoid planting white-barked birch species (e.g., Betula jacquemontii, B. pendula), which are especially susceptible to bronze birch borer. If planting birch, consider using Betula alleghaniensis, B. lenta, or B. nigra. Borers attack all birch, but these species appear to be less susceptible in California. Apply mulch to retain soil moisture and keep roots cooler. Provide sufficient irrigation, such as deep watering about every 1 to 2 weeks during prolonged dry weather. Do not fertilize birch unless nutrient deficiency has been confidently diagnosed as the cause of poor growth. Fertilization can increase birch’s demand for water, thereby increasing tree stress. Promptly remove dead and dying birch. Chip the wood or cut it into logs and solarize it under clear plastic to prevent adult borers from emerging and infesting nearby birch. Regularly monitor valued birches from mid-April through summer, looking for bark swelling and stains. Prune off and dispose of any infested branches before mid-September. Except for removing borer-infested and hazardous limbs whenever they appear, prune birch during late fall through March when adult bronze birch borers are not flying. If the critical cultural and environmental practices summarized above have been followed and bronze birch borer is a local problem, spraying birch thoroughly about twice (once during April and again about late May) with a pyrethroid insecticide (e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin) can kill adults and larvae hatching from eggs before larvae bore into wood. A professional applicator must be hired to apply an effective product using equipment that provides good spray coverage. To increase the likelihood of a satisfactory experience, see Pest Notes: Hiring a Pest Control Company. Application of a systemic insecticide (e.g., dinotefuran) may provide some control if trees are relatively healthy and contain relatively few or no borers. Treatment can be warranted where nearby birch are infested and a source of borers. To minimize the potential adverse effect on pollinating insects, make any application of systemic insecticide soon after trees have completed flowering. See Homeowner Guide to Managing Bronze Birch Borer in the Upper Klamath Basin (PDF) for more information on this pest and how to protect pollinators when managing it with insecticides. Severely infested trees will die regardless of treatment. Promptly remove birch that are highly infested, dying, or dead. Chip the wood or cut and solarize it under plastic to prevent borers from emerging to attack other birch. Do not rely on insecticide application alone or trees are likely to die from the cultural and environmental problems that caused them to become susceptible to attack by borers.",

    "description": "This soft scale (family Coccidae) generally does not threaten the health of plants it infests, but its copious honeydew and the resulting blackish sooty mold can be annoying. Brown soft scale prefers broadleaf evergreens, but it can occur on the leaves and twigs of almost any broadleaved plant.",
    "identification": "Brown soft scale females are oval, slightly convex in profile, and yellowish to dark or light brown. Mature females are 1/10 to 1/6 inch long. The scale occurs on leaves or twigs and rarely on fruit. Citricola scale resembles brown soft scale and both species can occur on citrus and hackberry (Celtis species). However, citricola scale has only one generation per year so its individuals are uniform in size unlike the differing age (size) in colonies of brown soft scale. Citricola scale occurs on leaves only during the summer and fall and on twigs in the late fall, winter, and spring. Brown soft scale is present on twigs throughout the year and on leaves when present, such as overwinter on evergreen hosts.",
    "life_cycle": "Female brown soft scales lay a few eggs at a time over an extended period, mostly throughout the summer. Eggs hatch almost immediately, and the crawlers (mobile first instars) soon settle and feed. Nymphs molt twice and mature into females. No males have been observed in California. Several different-sized life stages usually occur together at the same time. Populations are usually highest from midsummer to early fall. Brown soft scale has three to five generations per year.",
    "damage": "Brown soft scales suck phloem sap and excrete sticky honeydew on which grows blackish sooty mold. However even when very abundant this scale appears to have no significant adverse effect on its host. Hosts are numerous and include aspen, avocado, bay laurel, citrus, cottonwood, holly, manzanita, palm, poplar, strawberry tree, and willow. See the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ScaleNet database for a complete list of the plants this scale can infest.",
    "solutions": "Predators and especially tiny, parasitic wasps can provide effective biological control of brown soft scale if conservation of natural enemies is practiced. To improve the effectiveness of natural enemies, control ants, minimize dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the application of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Parasitic wasps attacking brown soft scale include Metaphycus angustifrons, M. luteolus, M. stanleyi, and Coccophagus species. The female parasites primarily lay their eggs in the early instars, before scales mature and can produce offspring. Because brown soft scale generations overlap, it provides parasites with the nymphal stages susceptible to parasitism throughout the year. Parasitism of brown soft scale is very effective unless disrupted by ants, dust, or broad-spectrum, persistent pesticides. Evidence of parasitism includes exit holes of adult parasites in nymphs or mature females. When parasitized, nymphs may turn black. The immature Metaphycus parasites themselves (larvae and pupae) can sometimes be observed through the cuticle (outer covering) of brown soft scale. The Australian lady beetle (Rhyzobius lophanthae), brown lacewings, green lacewings, and twicestabbed lady beetle prey on all stages of brown soft scale. During the scale's adult stage, early instars of the lady beetles can feed beneath their host so they are easily overlooked. In locations with hot summers, pruning to open plant canopies can increase scale mortality from heat exposure and improve parasite access to this pest. When direct control is warranted, after employing the natural enemy conservation practices, infested terminals can be thoroughly sprayed with horticultural oil during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring. See the section Monitoring in Pest Notes: Scales for how to effectively time oil application.",

    "description": "This longhorned beetle, or roundheaded wood borer (Cerambycidae), aggressively attacks apparently healthy broadleaf trees in the eastern United States. This pest is not established in California as of 2017.",
    "identification": "The boring larvae cause liquid ooze and sawdustlike frass (excrement) on bark and dying limbs. The initially low populations of borers in a tree can easily be overlooked. After larvae pupate, each emerging adult leaves a relatively large, smooth-edged hole about 1/2 inch in diameter in bark. Adults are shiny and mostly black. Each wing cover (elytron) has about 20 white blotches. The antennae have 11 segments; each segment is bluish black with a whitish base. The antennae of the males are more than twice the body length, hence the name longhorned. The antennae of females is about one and one-half the body length. Mature larvae, pupae, and the body of adults are about 3/4 to 1-1/4 inches long. The introduced Asian longhorned beetle can be distinguished from several native species by differences in their markings. For example, the native banded alder borer thorax is white with a single, large, black spot that is one-half or more of the width of the thorax. The thorax of Asian longhorned beetles is entirely shiny black.",
    "life_cycle": "Asian longhorned beetles develop though four life stages—egg, larva, pupa and adult. The adult female can lay up to 90 eggs, one egg each at the bottom of irregular-shaped craters she chews in bark. In a lightly infested tree, these dime-sized, egg-laying pits are more common near to the top of the tree and on larger branches. In a tree that is heavily infested, egg-laying craters can be found on bark throughout the tree. After hatching, the larva chews into the tree and feeds initially in cambium and sapwood, and later in heartwood. Larvae develop through five, increasingly larger instars (growth stages) before pupating in a chamber the mature larva chews in sapwood. Adults emerge and mate, and the females lay eggs. Females feed on leaf midribs, leaf petioles, and twig bark. About 2 years are required to complete one generation in the eastern Untied States.",
    "damage": "Asian longhorned beetle damages the appearance and health of various hardwood trees. Infested trees drop dead branches, and eventually die. Quarantines intended to stop the beetle's spread require the prompt removal of infested trees. Hundreds of thousands of trees have been removed in the eastern United States in an ongoing effort to prevent this pest from spreading.",
    "solutions": "Because Asian longhorned beetle aggressively attacks apparently healthy broadleaf trees, avoiding its introduction, establishment, and spread are the primary management methods. Submit any suspected Asian longhorned beetles found in California to the county agricultural commissioner. To avoid spreading wood-boring pests, do not move firewood or logs to other counties. Purchase firewood near where you will burn it, and leave any unused wood on site rather than moving it or bringing it home. To avoid damage from most wood borers, plant trees that are well adapted to the site conditions, provide proper cultural care, and protect trees from injuries. Prune off dead limbs during the season when adult borers are not active. Promptly remove dead or dying trees. Do not store freshly cut wood near trees; debark or solarize logs beneath clear plastic in the sun to prevent beetles from emerging from cut wood and attacking nearby hosts. Forest Service website",

    "life_cycle": "Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After mating, adult females chew an egg-laying tunnel in the base of hosts. After hatching from an egg, larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars as they feed and tunnel in plants. Mature larvae generally exit hosts to pupate in topsoil; pupae can also occur in the base of plants. One generation egg to adult can be completed in less than 2 months when temperatures are warm. There can be 4 or 5 generations per year.",
    "damage": "Adults feed on host sap and this does not threaten plant health. Adult feeding causes discolored, punctured spots or small holes in the foliage. Larvae bore in the base of hosts, causing plants to decline and facilitating entry of plant pathogens. Larval feeding in combination with decay microorganisms that colonize wounded tissue commonly cause infested plants to collapse and die. Agave weevil larvae infest various Agave spp. They bore in the plant base and upper roots of large species of agave that have wide leaf blades and bluish or gray leaf coloring, such as century plant (A. americana). The more narrow-leaved, smaller agaves are less commonly infested. Yucca weevil larvae infest chaparral yucca, or Our Lord’s candle, Hesperoyucca (=Yucca) whipplei.",
    "solutions": "Direct control of agave and yucca weevils is difficult; even with regular inspection of hosts, the insects are often not observed until the plant starts to collapse. Preventive measures are the only effective controls. Provide plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care. Agave and yucca require well drained soils, full sun, and little or no irrigation after they become established. Plant on a mound or raised bed to improve soil drainage. Where feasible, before planting amend soil with sand or other porous materials to improve drainage. Minimize irrigation of established hosts. After any irrigation, allow topsoil to dry between watering events. To help protect nearby hosts, remove dying hosts and the immediately adjacent soil where larvae may be pupating. Promptly dispose of infested material in ways that prevent weevils from emerging or escaping. Where agave weevil has been a problem, consider planting the smaller, narrower-leaved agave species. If applied BEFORE plants become infested, certain systemic insecticides (e.g., imidacloprid) may provide control.",

Spot treat where aphids are most abundant to preserve natural enemies elsewhere. Repeated soap sprays may wash away stickiness and exposed cast skins.

Willow beaked-gall midge, Mayetiola rigidae, causes infested shoot tips to swell and the nearby leaves to drop, leaving a twig gall that may have a point, resembling a beak. An eriophyid mite, Vasates laevigatae, causes numerous tiny, green swellings in leaves, resembling beads. The willow leaf gall sawfly, Pontania pacifica, commonly causes green to reddish berry­like galls on Salix lasiolepis foliage. Each gall may be globular or elongate and up to 1/3 inch long. The galls are quite variable in size, shape, color, and number per leaf. Willow leaf gall sawfly adults are stout, broad-waisted wasps. The males are shiny black, and females are dull reddish. Larvae are legless and light green, yellow, or whitish with a light brown head. The last instar larva is approximately 2/5 inch long. The cocoon is oblong, 1/4 inch long, and reddish brown to creamy white. Externally the cocoon is covered with pieces of plant debris and soil particles.",

    "life_cycle": "Webworms develop through four stages—egg, larva (caterpillar), pupa, and adult (moth). The time of year each life stage is present and the number of generations can vary by the location and species of host plant. Cypress leaftier. Female moths lay pale, disklike eggs singly on the scalelike leaves of hosts. The emerging larvae feed singly in a cocoonlike nest and can be present most any time of the year. Larvae may periodically abandon their feeding nest and form a new nest on undamaged shoot tips. Most of the larval feeding and foliage browning occur during spring and early summer as larvae mature. Overwintering is as larvae, which pupate during late winter to spring. Adult females can be present and laying eggs anytime from March through September, mostly during April through June. There appears to be two, overlapping generations per year. Cypress webber. Overwintering is as larvae, which pupate in the spring. By late spring, the adults emerge and mate and females lay eggs in a group on the terminal leaves of hosts. There is one generation per year. Juniper webworm.

There is one generation per year. Mimosa webworm. Larvae overwinter and pupate in a whitish cocoon on bark or in litter beneath trees. The adults emerge and mate and females lay eggs in spring. The mimosa webworm usually has two generations per year in California.",
    "damage": "The caterpillars chew leaves and form silken tents or webbing on host trees. Their feeding causes foliage to turn brown, die, and drop prematurely. When abundant, larvae can consume all the leaves on a tree. Vigorous and otherwise-healthy plants generally tolerate extensive leaf chewing and moderate defoliation. Most webworm species are not abundant during most years and commonly their presence is innocuous. Mature larvae of mimosa webworm drop from trees on a silk strand before pupating, When abundant, the strands annoy people and foul surfaces and vehicles under infested trees. Larvae move after dropping from hosts and pupate in white cocoons on buildings or other structures. Sometimes larvae enter homes to pupate.",
    "solutions": "Webworm abundance is sporadic in part because they are fed on by many parasites and predators. To preserve the effectiveness of these natural enemies, rely on pruning and selective insecticides if feasible when control action is warranted. Regularly inspect host plants for silken webbing; prune out caterpillar-infested foliage if limited to small portions of the plant. If webbing containing live caterpillars is abundant and cannot be pruned off or tolerated, apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad with a high-pressure sprayer to penetrate webbed foliage. The addition of a wetting agent to increase penetration of the silk by the insecticide enhances control. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. The somewhat-selective spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply it to plants that are flowering. If caterpillar-infested trees are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. Request they apply caterpillar-selective Bt, or spinosad if the plants to be sprayed are not blossoming. High populations of the cypress leaftier and juniper webworm may not be well-controlled by Bt or spinosad; these insecticides are not persistent and the webworms emerge and feed over an extended period. A broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticide such as carbaryl can be applied in the spring when larvae and the egg-laying adults are present. Do not apply carbaryl if bees are present; carbaryl is very toxic to bees and most natural enemies. Because it poisons parasites and predators, applying carbaryl may increase the frequency or likelihood of webworms becoming abundant again later or cause a secondary outbreak of spider mites.

    "description": "This introduced (exotic) sucking insect (Coccidae) is a serious pest in the San Francisco Bay Area on tulip tree, Liriodendron tulipifera, and on deciduous magnolias. Its other hosts include gardenia and linden.",
    "identification": "Mature females are up to 1/3 inch long, irregularly hemispherical, and variably colored, usually brown or gray with irregular black blotches and markings of green, orange, pink, red, or yellow. Older females are more uniformly brown and resemble certain lecanium scales, Parthenolecanium spp. However, the lecanium females mature earlier and by late June are dead and dried out; female tuliptree scales are alive through the fall. Male tuliptree scale nymphs mature into adults within gray to white, puparia (hardened skins of the older nymphs). Puparia are about 1/10 inch long, flat, and broadly oval. The delicate adult male has a red body and one pair of wings. Crawlers (mobile first instars) are reddish. Settled first instars and early-second instars are about 1/24 inch long, oval, chocolate brown, and very difficult to see. Large colonies of tuliptree scale commonly have a distinctive, strong, musky odor.",
    "life_cycle": "Females mature in late spring and are alive throughout the summer and fall (they exude liquid when their body is squashed). Males develop into adults in spring, mate, live only a brief time as adults, and do not feed. Adult females produce crawlers from August through November and give life birth to nymphs. First instars settle to feed on leaves and young twigs. Overwintering is as dark, second-instar nymphs on twigs. There is one generation per year.",
    "damage": "The scales suck phloem sap and excrete copious, sticky honeydew, which results in blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants. Heavy infestations weaken or kill young trees. Feeding on terminals can cause shoot dieback, leading to bushy regrowth. On older trees, feeding by prolonged high populations causes limb dieback and the decline and sometimes death of tulip trees.",
    "solutions": "Control ants, which attack scale parasites and predators, interfering with biological pest control. If applying horticultural oil, spray overwintering nymphs during late winter (delayed-dormant season, as buds begin to swell) or spray foliage and shoot terminals during September or October, after most crawlers have emerged. Applying a systemic insecticide is the most practical method for managing this difficult-to-control pest on large trees. Because systemic insecticides can move into nectar and pollen, to minimize toxicity to pollinators and natural enemies that visit flowers, make the application after plants have completed their seasonal flowering.",

Anthracnose and powdery mildew fungi also commonly cause discoloring and premature drop of sycamore leaves. Distinguish sycamore scale by the tiny, discolored leaf spots it causes and by the scales' cottony wax, especially on bark. The insects themselves are brown or yellow and less than 1/12 inch long. Except for the crawler stage, sycamore scale does not resemble most other scales. Adults resemble immature (wingless) thrips. The nymphs and resting-stage preadults, called cysts, are elliptical and resemble insect eggs or tiny footballs. During certain stages, nymphs produce whitish wax and resemble whitefly pupae. Male cocoons, mature females, and egg masses can also be covered with cottony white tufts.",
    "life_cycle": "Sycamore scales can occur on foliage from leaf flush through fall and on tender bark anytime of year. They overwinter on and beneath bark, where eggs hatch during late winter. The crawlers (mobile first instars) move from bark to feed on leaves. Some scales develop on bark or move between leaves and bark during summer.",
    "damage": "Sycamore scale causes small, yellow spots on leaves. Infested leaves can become distorted and stunted and may turn brown and die or drop prematurely. Prolonged high populations of the scale can stunt tree growth and cause dieback of twigs and small branches. On young trees, infestations can cause abnormal bark roughening and sloughing off of bark.",
    "solutions": "Provide appropriate growing conditions and cultural care and protect trees from injuries. Healthy trees are better able to tolerate pest damage, such as premature leaf drop. Lady beetles that feed on sycamore scale include the twicestabbed lady beetle and Exochomus quadripustulatus, which is black with four orange to yellow blotches. Foliar sprays are not recommended because trees are often large and it is difficult to thoroughly wet the underside of leaves where scales feed. If scales were abundant the previous season and damage cannot be tolerated, apply narrow-range oil or another insecticide during bud break.",

The spruce spider mite, O. ununguis, can occur on virtually any conifer, including arborvitae, Chamaecyparis, coast redwood, Douglas-fir, fir, giant sequoia, juniper, spruce, and occasionally pine. These tiny mites have an oval, unsegmented body. Depending in part on the host plant and mite species, these mites can be brown, green, or pink. The spruce spider mite produces webbing, especially around the base of needles; neither O. subnudus nor O. milleri produces obvious webbing.",
    "life_cycle": "Spider mites and the predatory mites (Phytoseiidae) that prey on them develop through five life stages. Eggs hatch, producing six-legged larvae. The two nymphal stages and adults have eight legs. Spider mite populations are relatively low on conifers during the winter. Oligonychus subnudus is most abundant in the spring. Oligonychus milleri can be abundant anytime from spring through fall. Spruce spider mite is usually most abundant in the spring and fall, and populations stop reproducing under prolonged high temperatures.",
    "damage": "Feeding by Oligonychus spp. mites causes conifer foliage to become bleached or discolored bronze, reddish, or yellow. Mite damage is usually not as serious as it looks. Most plants tolerate extensive leaf bleaching and stippling without being seriously harmed.",
    "solutions": "The most important management actions are to conserve natural enemies of mites and provide trees with proper cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation to keep plants healthy. Drought-stressed plants experience more mite outbreaks and are less able to tolerate pest feeding. Regularly sprinkling foliage and washing plants during hot weather helps control some mites, in part by removing dust and improving the environment for predaceous mites. High-levels of nitrogen in foliage can favor outbreaks of some mites by increasing their reproduction. Do not apply nitrogen unless fertilization is truly necessary. Avoid applying high rates of nitrogen and use less-soluble forms, such as urea and most organic fertilizers. Natural enemies, especially predaceous mites, frequently control plant-feeding mites. Avoid using broad-spectrum, residual pesticides (e.g., carbamates, organophosphates, and pyrethroids) for mites or other pests. Even though their labels may say they control mites, these pesticides kill mite predators. Also, they can induce physiological changes in mites or host plants and, especially during hot weather, sometimes cause dramatic outbreaks of mites. If spraying is warranted, use selective miticides (also called acaricides) or horticultural oil. Be aware that applying horticultural (narrow-range) oil can remove the desirable bluish cast on foliage of certain spruces; this does not damage tree health. Feeding on young foliage may not produce obvious damage until months later, when foliage matures. Therefore, the effectiveness of any current treatment (e.g., thoroughly covering foliage with narrow-range, horticultural oil) may not become apparent until the following season. See Pest Notes: Spider Mites and Mites Associated with Pine Foliage in California for more information.",

It is distinguished by its two tail filaments, which are longer than its body. Citrus mealybug Planococcus citri Identification tip: Citrus mealybug is a pest of citrus and some indoor ornamentals. It has short, waxy filaments of equal length all around its margin; a dark stripe may be visible down its back. Cypressbark mealybug Ehrhornia cupressi Identification tip: The cypress bark mealybug occurs beneath bark plates on cedar, cypress, and juniper in Pacific Coast states. Nymphs and adults are round, bright red or orangish, and are surrounded by a ring of white wax. Ground mealybugs Rhizoecusspp. Identification tip:Ground mealybugs commonly live in the soil and feed on the roots of many different plants. They may be covered with white wax and their short antennae and legs may be visible, but they do not have obvious filaments along their sides and tail. Gill mealybugs Ferrisia gilli Identification tip: Gill's mealybug causes problems on pistachios, almonds, grapes, stone fruits, and many deciduous ornamentals. They have pink bodies and are covered in white wax. They are also sometimes covered in crystalline filaments, giving the appearance of having long glassy rods. Pink hibiscus mealybug, Maconellicoccus hirsutus\nIdentification tip: The pink hibiscus mealybug is a major problem of many plant species, including citrus, grapes, fig, mulberry, hibiscus, coral tree, and orchid tree. Adults are small, pink, and covered with a waxy secretion. They have very short waxy filaments, often covered by the white mealy wax.

Vine mealybug, Planococcus ficus\nIdentification tip: Vine mealybugs are small (adult females are about 1/8 inch in length), soft, oval, flat, distinctly segmented, and covered with a white, mealy wax that extends into spines (filaments along the body margin and the posterior end). The vine mealybug has a pinkish body that is visible through the powdery wax. Grape mealybug, Pseudococcus maritimus\nIdentification tip: The grape mealybug and the obscure mealybug closely resemble each other. One method of distinguishing them in the field is to poke a female with a sharp point (without puncturing the body) to elicit the release of a defensive excretion. If the color of the fluid excreted is reddish orange, then it is most likely grape mealybug. Solenopsis mealybug, Phenacoccus solenopsis\nIdentification tip: The solenopsis mealybug has a wide host range, feeding on various broadleaf species such as tomatoes, eggplant, melons, and potatoes. Adult females have oval bodies covered with a waxy covering with dark bare areas on the thorax and abdomen.",

    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/roundheadbore.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Most any woody species can become infested by longhorned beetles (Cerambycidae), also called roundheaded wood borers. The larvae chew inner bark and sometimes the wood of limbs, trunks, and main roots. Most species of longhorned beetles primarily attack trees that were already injured or stressed.",
    "identification": "Oval-shaped or round emergence holes in bark and cracked, stained, or oozing liquid on limbs or trunks are common symptoms of infestation by roundheaded wood borers. Exceptions include California prionus, Prionus californicus, which chews the surface of roots, then bores inside roots and pupates in soil; no bark damage or emergence holes may be evident aboveground. Foliage may discolor and wilt, limbs may die back, and branches or entire plants may die when infested by roundheaded wood borers. There are many causes of similar damage, including aeration deficit, cold temperatures, root-disease pathogens, water deficit and other types of bark- and wood-boring insects. To help distinguish the cause, assess whether plants are experiencing other maladies e.g., those named above. Examine unhealthy limbs for adult borer emergence holes, or cut beneath damaged or discolored bark and look for tunnels with frass (insect excrement) or the insects themselves. Adult roundheaded borers are medium to large, elongate, cylindrical beetles. Their long antennae (\"horns\") are often longer than their body length. Their body color varies by species. Adults can be dull brownish or gray, brightly colored, or a mix of pale and dark colors in a banded or spotted pattern. The larvae typically are creamy white, cylindrical in cross-section, elongate, and distinctly segmented. Species of Cerambycidae. Important introduced (exotic) species include eucalyptus longhorned borers and the Asian longhorned beetle (ALB), which is established in the eastern United States and has been spreading westward. Several native longhorned beetles resemble ALB; they all are black and white patterned. Submit any suspected ALB to the county agricultural commissioner. The native poplar borer (Saperda calcarata) infests unhealthy aspen, cottonwood, poplar, and willow. The banded alder borer (or California laurel borer), California prionus, nautical borer (Xylotrechus nauticus), and Neoclytus conjunctus attack dying or recently killed oaks and other woody species. The roundheaded fir borer (Tetropium abietis) attacks and kills weakened firs that might otherwise have survived. For identification help, contact your local UC ANR Cooperative Extension office or consult A Photographic Catalog of the Cerambycidae of the New World by the California Department of Food and Agriculture and Screening Aid for the Cerambycidae of the Western U.S.A. (PDF) by the Oregon Department of Agriculture and U.S. Forest Service.",
    "life_cycle": "Females lay eggs in bark crevices, and the emerging larvae bore into the inner bark and sapwood. Some species bore deeper into the heartwood. Larvae chew increasingly larger mines as they grow, and pack their mines with frass and coarse wood debris. After pupation, the adult leaves a round or oval hole in the surface of the bark or wood. Longhorned beetles can take one or more years to complete one generation, but this can vary by beetle species, host quality, growing location, and time of the year. For example, during the spring and summer eucalyptus longhorned borers may complete their life cycle in 3 to 4 months; eggs laid during the fall and winter may require up to 9 months to develop into adults.",
    "damage": "Native species of roundheaded borers attack mostly damaged or dying plants; vigorous trees are rarely attacked. Certain introduced species can be serious pests, attacking and killing trees that appeared to be healthy before becoming infested by borers. The wood-boring larvae can be serious pests because their chewing damages plants’ vascular system. Larval tunneling weakens limbs and trunks and can kill branches or entire plants.",
    "solutions": "Prevention is the primary method of preventing damage by longhorned beetles. Plant trees that are well adapted to the site conditions, provide proper cultural care, and protect trees from injuries. Appropriate irrigation is particularly important; plants are seriously damaged by irrigating too frequently or by providing too little water. Prune off dead limbs during the season when adult borers are not active. Promptly remove dead or dying trees. Do not store freshly cut wood near trees. Debark or solarize logs beneath clear plastic in the sun to prevent beetles from emerging from the wood and attacking nearby hosts. Except for pruning and general cultural practices that improve tree vigor, little can be done to control most boring insects beneath bark once trees are already significantly damaged or unhealthy. Larvae of the larger, shallow-boring species can sometimes be killed by probing tunnels with a sharp wire. This method is practical only on a small plant, and it is often difficult to know whether the wire has sufficiently penetrated the tunnel and killed the larva. For certain borers, especially valuable trees may be protected from further attack by a well-timed application of a broad-spectrum, persistent insecticide to bark, or in some instances certain systemic insecticides. However, unless trees are monitored regularly so that borer activity and attack can be detected early, and the type of boring insect is identified so an effective treatment method can be selected, pesticide use is likely to be too late and ineffective. Do not substitute insecticide applications for proper cultural care. Most borers are attracted to trees that are already unhealthy from other causes, and relying only on insecticide can allow trees to die from those other causes unless the growing environment and cultural practices are improved.",

    "description": "This armored scale (family Diaspididae) can be a serious pest of nut and stone fruit trees and has numerous other hosts.",
    "identification": "Crawlers (mobile first instars) are bright yellow, about the size of the sharp end of a pin, and have well developed antennae, eyes, and legs. After settling to feed, crawlers lose their appendages and become immobile. Settled first instars soon secrete a white cover (the white-cap stage), which later darkens (the black cap). The cover of adults and older nymphs is gray or brown and gray with a raised, gold-colored nipple (skin of earlier nymph) near the center. As they grow the cover of males becomes elongate whereas the cover of females remains round. Female covers are 1/25 to 1/12 inch in diameter at maturity. The female body remains beneath the cover and is roundish or deltoid shaped, smooth, and yellow. At maturity the elongated male covers are smaller than covers of females. The adult male emerges from beneath its cover and is a delicate, orange insect with long antennae and one pair of wings. The cover of female San Jose scales resembles that of olive scale (Parlatoria oleae), except that the female olive scale’s body beneath its cover is purple. Both species can occur on many of the same hosts, but olive scale is under excellent biological control and is rarely abundant unless its natural enemies are disrupted. Walnut scale (Diaspidiotus juglansregiae) also resembles San Jose scale, except that under its cover, the margin of the female’s yellow body has distinct indentations. Walnut scale is often found in daisy-shaped groups that develop when male crawlers settle under the margin of the circular female cover and begin forming their elongated covers adjacent to their mother. Walnut scale is usually abundant only on ash, birch, and walnut.",
    "life_cycle": "San Jose scale overwinters on bark mostly as the black cap (older first instars). In the spring, the scales grow and the roundish females become distinguishable from the elongated, immature males. Males molt four times, whereas females molt twice. Winged adult males begin emerging in March and April and females produce a sex pheromone that attracts the adult males. About a month after mating, the first generation of crawlers appears in about May. San Jose scale has 3 to 4 generations per growing season, taking about 7 to 8 weeks per generation during warm weather.",
    "damage": "San Jose scale generally is a serious pest only on nut trees and stone fruits. It sucks juices from limbs and twigs and injects a toxic saliva. When abundant, its feeding causes a loss of tree vigor, growth, and productivity and the death of limbs. If scales are abundant and not controlled, they can kill fruit spurs and scaffold limbs within 1 to 3 years and cause trees to decline. After deciduous plants drop their leaves in the fall, brown dead foliage often remains on heavily infested branches that were killed by the scale. A red halo is produced around a feeding site on 1-year-old green wood. San Jose scale can also be a pest on roses, generally only when the roses grow near infested fruit or nut trees. Hosts on which San Jose scale is generally not abundant enough to cause damage include acacia, aspen, cottonwood, maple, mulberry, poplar, pyracantha, and willow. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of hosts and references for more information.",
    "solutions": "Numerous parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on San Jose scale as listed at ScaleNet. The twicestabbed lady beetle, a dark, pinhead-sized nitidulid beetle (Cybocephalus californicus), and tiny parasitic wasps, including Aphytis and Encarsia species, are important natural enemies of San Jose scale. To conserve (preserve) natural enemies and improve biological control of scales, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more suggestions. If spraying insecticide is warranted, use horticultural or narrow-range oil or another insecticide least disruptive to biological control. Horticultural oil can be sprayed during the dormant season, except not on plum and walnut which may be damaged by dormant-season oil. If spraying during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers beginning in April with double-sided sticky tape and spray 2 to 3 weeks after the bright yellow, pin-point-sized scale crawlers are first observed in the tape traps. Alternatively, on high-value trees, use pheromone traps and degree-day monitoring to time applications as described in the UC IPM Pest Management Guidelines: Almonds.",

    "description": "This sawfly (Cephidae) mines inside the terminals of caneberries (e.g., blackberries and raspberries) and roses, causing shoot tips to wilt and die. This insect differs from the wood-boring horntails (Siricidae), although both groups are wasps (Hymenoptera).",
    "identification": "Cane terminals that wilt, then discolor and die are the obvious symptom of this pest's presence. Shoot dieback can also be caused by inappropriate irrigation, poor soil drainage and aeration deficit, root-decay pathogens, and certain other disorders and pests. It is important to correctly distinguish the cause because some maladies causing look-alike damage can kill affected plants. To determine whether raspberry horntail is present, examine stem terminals especially where the second and third leaves from the tip attach to the cane. This is where female wasps insert their eggs and cause a small, circular discoloration of the cane. Canes may also become slightly swollen when a larva has fed inside. Cut open the affected area to expose any tunnel with brown, granular frass (excrement) and sometimes an immature raspberry horntail or its cast skin. Larvae are cream-colored to white and cylindrical with distinct segments. The head is pale brown and at the rear end is a short spine. Larvae have three pairs of true legs immediately behind the head and grow up to 9/10 inch long. Raspberry horntail larvae have no prolegs (leglike appendages on the abdomen), unlike the six or more pairs of prolegs of sawfly larvae that feed openly on plants. Adults are broad-waist wasps, 1/2 to 3/4 inch long with elongate, cylindrical bodies. The females are mostly yellow and orangish with black. Males are mostly black with some yellow and orange. Eggs are 1/16 inch long, curved, oval, pearly white, and somewhat flattened with a point at one end. Several eggs can be laid in one stem, but only one larva per terminal survives.",
    "life_cycle": "Adults emerge and mate beginning in March and the females lay eggs that hatch within several days. The young larva feeds spirally just beneath the surface, girdling the terminal and causing it to wilt. The larva then chews and lengthens a tunnel in the cane as it feeds and develops through four or five, increasingly larger instars (immature stages) during spring and summer. The mature larva chews downward into cane pith and forms a silk-lined cell where it overwinters as a prepupa. In late winter to early spring, it pupates into an adult and chews a round, emergence hole in the cane. There is one generation per year in most locations. In some locations there may be two generations per year.",
    "damage": "Infested terminals wilt and discolor during the spring, then die back by late summer and sometimes break if not pruned off. Infestation may reduce the abundance of blossoms and fruit. Raspberry horntail does not seriously threaten the long-term health or survival of infested plants.",
    "solutions": "Inspect canes regularly during spring and summer and prune off and dispose of wilted terminals. Make the cuts below wilted leaves and any stem swelling and discolored, egg-laying wound in canes. Pruning off damaged shoots greatly reduces the subsequent abundance of raspberry horntails and their damage, and within 1 or 2 years may eliminate an infestation. Insecticide sprays are not recommended. See The Cephid Stem Borers of California (PDF) for more information.

    "description": "Sawflies are not true flies (Diptera). These wasps (Hymenoptera) are named for the adult female’s sawlike, abdominal appendage for insert­ing eggs into plant tissue. Sawflies vary greatly in feeding habits. Willow gall sawflies feed inside tissues and cause the host to develop colorful swellings. Raspberry horntail bores in stems of caneberries, roses, salmonberry, and thimbleberry, causing shoot dieback. Species with larvae that chew openly on foliage include California pear sawfly, certain conifer sawflies, cypress and juniper sawflies, pear sawfly, and rose sawflies (roseslugs). Some species web foliage on which they chew and feed. Hosts of other sawfly pests include alder, birch, oak, and poplar.",
    "identification": "Adults are usually 1/2 inch long or shorter and blackish or brownish overall with orange, red, or yellow. Their abdomen is broadly attached to the thorax; most other types of adult wasps have a narrow “waist” between the abdomen and thorax. In addition to three pairs of legs on the thorax, larvae of sawflies that feed exposed on plants have six or more pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on their abdomen. There are five or fewer pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage.",
    "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After hatching from an egg, larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars (growth stages), then pupate and emerge as an adult. Most sawflies in California overwinter as eggs in plant tissue or as mature larvae (prepupae) in litter, topsoil, or on hosts. Depending on the species and location, sawflies have from one to several generations per year.",
    "damage": "Sawfly feeding varies greatly by species and includes larvae that chew openly on foliage, feed within leaves they roll or web with silk, or tunnel inside leaves or stems. Healthy trees and shrubs generally tolerate moderate defoliation, galling, or mining without significant loss of flowering, fruit yield, or plant growth. Species that sporadically become abundant and extensively defoliate hosts may cause decline and occasionally the death of conifers and plants that are young or already unhealthy from other causes.",
    "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on or inside a small portion of the plant. Most sawfly larvae that feed openly on foliage are relatively easy to control if thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides including carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). See the sawflies named above for more information on those species. See Sawflies on Ornamentals from Oregon State University for information on sawfly pests of azalea, dogwood, mountain ash, oak, and certain other hosts.

    "description": "At least three species of sawflies (Tenthredinidae) are occasional pests of roses in California. The most common is bristly roseslug (Cladius difformis). Occasional pests are the curled rose sawfly, or curled roseslug (Allantus cinctus), and the roseslug (Endelomyia aethiops), also called American, European, or common roseslug.",
    "identification": "Adults are stout, 3/8 to 2/3 inch long, and mostly black with orange or yellow, varying by gender and species. Adults have two pairs of wings with distinct veins and a broad waist, unlike most wasps (Hymenoptera) that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on at least six abdominal segments; unlike the five or fewer abdominal segments with prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. Take care to distinguish roseslugs from beneficial syrphid larvae that feed on rose aphids. Roseslugs occur near chewed or scraped leaves, while syrphids occur among aphids and do not chew on plants. Syrphid larvae have no true legs, while roseslugs have three pairs of short legs on the thorax.",
    "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Females insert small eggs in the margin of rose leaves. Larvae hatch and grow through about five, increasingly larger instars (growth stages). Depending on the species and situation, rose sawflies pupate in cocoons on leaves, in organic litter beneath plants, or in a cell in twigs or the stub end of cut roses. Rose sawflies in California have one or more generations per year.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew and scrape the leaf surface, chew entirely through foliage, or both varying by the age and species. Feeding by sawfly larvae can make foliage unsightly and when severe may reduce the subsequent blossoming, but does not threaten the survival of otherwise-healthy roses.",
    "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Handpick larvae or clip off and dispose of infested foliage if rose sawflies are on a small portion of the plant. Larvae are relatively easy to control if they are thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms.

    "name": "Root knot nematodes",
    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/rtnem.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Nematodes are tiny (usually microscopic) unsegmented roundworms. Root knot nematodes are the most common nematodes attacking annual and perennial landscape plants, especially in warm, irrigated, coarse-textured soils (sand, sandy loam, and loamy sand). Many landscape tree and shrub species are hosts of root knot nematodes, as are many herbaceous ornamentals and common weeds. More than one root knot nematode species can occur at the same site. A plant species resistant to one species of root knot nematode may still be susceptible to other Meloidogyne spp.",
    "identification": "Root knot nematodes cause galls or swellings on roots of many broadleaf plants. Some infected plants, especially annual grasses and certain legumes, may exhibit no galls even though nematodes still reproduce on them. When roots infected with root knot nematodes are washed they may appear gnarled and restricted. Beneficial nitrogen-fixing bacteria often form nodules on the roots of beans and other legumes, but these rub off roots easily, while galls caused by root knot nematodes are truly swellings of the roots. Also, a thumbnail can easily be pressed into a nitrogen-fixing bacterial gall, but not into a root knot gall. There are many other causes of plant galls.",
    "life_cycle": "Plant-feeding nematodes develop through six stages: egg, four juvenile stages, and adult. Many species can develop from egg to egg-laying adult in as little as 3 to 4 weeks when the soil is warm and moist. Root knot nematodes spend most of their active life cycle in galls on roots. First-stage juveniles stay in the egg. The second stage hatches from the egg and moves through soil to invade new sites, usually near root tips, causing root cells to grow into giant cells where the nematodes feed as second-, third-, and fourth-stage juveniles. As feeding continues, the plant produces a gall around the infected area. Mature females produce eggs in a small gelatinous mass on the root surface or inside the root. Adult females remain in roots and produce an egg mass. Males leave and move through soil to seek and mate with females.",
    "damage": "Boxwood, rose, and most fruit and nut trees can be damaged in landscapes by Meloidogyne spp. Many other species are hosts. Roots infected by nematodes may become attacked by other pathogens, including those causing crown gall, root and crown decays, and certain vascular wilt diseases. Root knot nematodes usually cause distinctive swellings on the roots of affected plants, which damage the water- and nutrient-conducting abilities of the roots. Galls can crack or split open, allowing entry of disease-causing microorganisms. Aboveground symptoms of a root knot nematode infestation include: wilting during the hottest part of the day even with adequate soil moisture, loss of vigor, yellowing leaves. Infested plants grow more slowly and produce fewer and smaller leaves and fruits. Damage is most serious in warm, irrigated, sandy soils.",
    "solutions": "To confirm a root knot nematode infestation, you must collect appropriate root and soil samples and send them to a laboratory that can provide positive identification of the infesting species. Nematodes are difficult to manage because in most landscape situations you cannot directly reduce their numbers. The following practical nematode management methods are preventive: Use good sanitation to avoid introducing or spreading nematodes. Grow plant cultivars or species that are nonhosts or are resistant or tolerant to nematode damage. Provide good cultural care and appropriate growing conditions to reduce stress on plants and increase their tolerance of infestations. To avoid introducing nematodes into landscapes, use only amendments, soil, and plants obtained from a reliable supplier that presumably are free of pathogens. Do not allow drainage or irrigation water from around infested plants to run off onto soil around healthy plants as this spreads nematodes. Do not transfer soil from around infested plants to healthy plants. Thoroughly wash soil and plant parts from all equipment and tools used around infested plants before leaving that site. Work first in uninfested areas before working around plants or soil suspected of being infested with nematodes. Consider replacing severely damaged plants and replant with species or cultivars more tolerant of the specific nematodes present; for example, do not replant the same plant genera into the old site.",

    "description": "Holes in rose blossoms can be caused by chewing insects including Fuller rose beetle, hoplia beetle, and rose curculios. The rose curculio (Merhynchites bicolor) and western rose curculio (M. wickhami) feed on caneberries and roses.",
    "identification": "Adult rose curculios are red and black, hard-bodied, snout beetles (weevils) about 1/4 inch long. They have an elongated head and mouthparts, distinct antennae, and long, black legs. Eggs are oval, about 1/25 inch long, and occur hidden in the bracts and buds of flowers. They are white to yellowish, then darken before hatching. The legless, plump larvae have distinct segments and are pale orange to whitish with a brown head. Larvae grow up to 1/4 inch long and occur hidden in flower buds and rose hips (fruit). Larvae of rose curculio resemble those of the rose midge, Dasineura rhodophaga. However, rose midge larvae grow to only 1/16 inch long and are rarely pests in California. Life cycle Adults emerge from soil beginning in the spring and seek young flower buds. The females chew small holes in the rose buds or hips to feed and lay eggs there. Adults can be present from about April through July. Eggs hatch within a few days of being laid and the larvae feed hidden within bud tissues. Larvae develop in buds that remain on the plant and in buds that fall to the ground. Later in the season larvae also feed in rose hips. Mature larvae emerge from buds or fruit on the plant, drop to the ground, and burrow into top soil. Overwintering is as inactive, mature larvae (prepupae) in a cell in soil. In late winter or early spring when soil warms, larvae pupate and adults soon emerge. Rose curculios have one generation per year.",

    "damage": "Rose weevil adults chew and puncture feed on rose buds, calyxes, and peduncles (flower stems). Injured parts may drop prematurely or remain on the plant. If damaged buds remain viable enough to open, the petals show distinct rounded holes and ragged areas. Unless buds are inspected regularly, damage occurrence can be overlooked until the buds open and display the damaged petals. Adults also chew petals of opened blossoms. If blossoms and flower buds are not plentiful, adult rose curculios may feed on the tips of new rose shoots, causing the death of terminals. Adults may also chew the stem of buds, causing the buds to wilt and die. Adult females lay their eggs in buds and the larvae feed on the petals and receptacle area. Larval infested buds commonly drop instead of maturing into flowers. ",
    "solutions": "Where rose curculios have been a problem, consider avoiding and replacing cultivars that have been most susceptible to damage. Handpick adults and dispose of infested buds. Rose buds or entire rose bushes can be protected with netting; choose a material that allows sunlight and water to penetrate but excludes insects. Certain insecticides can also provide control. Hand picking is very effective for controlling adults. Once rose buds appear, inspect them regularly for the presence of adult weevils and their damage. Because rose curculios prefer certain cultivars (commonly yellow and white blossoms), keep records of which plants the weevils are found on and focus subsequent monitoring on those. Regularly clip off and dispose of damaged buds, rose hips, and spent blossoms to reduce the abundance of weevil larvae that may infest them. If alternative hosts such as blackberries, boysenberries, and raspberries are present, also monitor their buds and handpick any weevils and clip and dispose of damaged buds and fruit. Adult weevils commonly drop from plants when disturbed. Hold a wide-mouth container half full of soapy water beneath infested parts and shake or touch the plant where the weevils are feeding. This induces weevil adults to drop down into the soapy water and drown. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter, sandy) and not compacted or high in clay content. Soil must be warm (at least 60°F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. Late summer and fall may be the most effective application times. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) to soil or trunks may control both adults and larvae. Foliar sprays are generally not recommended. If plants are especially susceptible to damage and handpicking is inadequate, a persistent, broad-spectrum insecticide can be applied, such as carbaryl mixed with horticultural oil.

    "identification": "Two of the most common pests in California gardens are the consperse stink bug, Euschistus conspersus, and the harlequin bug, Murgantia histrionica. Coloration in bugs varies. The consperse stink bug, Euschistus conspersus, is usually gray brown to green with speckled black legs. Don't confuse the consperse stink bug with the rough stink bug, Brochymena sulcata, which is a predator. The brown marmorated stink bug, often confused with the rough stink bug or consperse stink bug, is an invasive species and serious pest of many fruit and fruiting vegetable crops. The harlequin bug is black with distinctive red markings. Harlequin bugs can be confused with Bagrada bugs, an invasive species, but are much larger and lack the white markings characteristic of Bagrada bugs. Two other common stink bug species are the Say stink bug, Chlorochroa sayi, and the southern green stink bug, Nezara viridula. The Say stink bug is green with a white rim around its borders. The southern green stink bug is bright green and larger than other stink bugs. Consperse stink bug is the dominant species found in fruit and nut trees; the others are found primarily in vegetables.",
    "life_cycle": "Drum-shaped eggs with circular \"lids\" are laid in clusters on foliage. The nymphs, nearly round and often brightly colored, remain close together at first but scatter as they grow. They pass through four or five molts, gradually developing wings and adult coloration. Adults overwinter on the ground under leaves and become active in March or April. Stink bug infestations originate when adults fly in from weedy areas, often from the edges of sloughs and creeks where blackberries grow. Damage is often limited to the edges of fields near these areas, but in years with a lot of spring rain and late weed growth, stink bugs may be numerous and damage more widespread.",
    "damage": "Stink bugs attack a variety of fruits and vegetables from stone fruits to pears to beans to tomatoes, often leaving blemishes, depressions, or brown drops of excrement. On green tomatoes, damage appears as dark pinpricks surrounded by a light discolored area that remains green or turns yellow when fruit ripen. Areas beneath spots on tomatoes or depressed areas on pears become white and pithy but remain firm as the fruit ripens. On peaches, fruit turns brown and corky.",
    "solutions": "Handpick bugs or their eggs. Eliminate groundcovers or weedy areas in early spring before populations build up. Insecticides are generally not recommended in gardens for stink bugs. Parasites and general predators may contribute to control. See also True Bugs for more information.",

    "description": "Pit scales are named for the roundish depression that commonly forms in plant tissue where each scale nymph feeds. At least eight species occur in California. Most damaging are Asterodiaspis (=Asterolecanium) species of oak pit scales that feed on and can severely damage Quercus species. Pittosporum pit scale, Planchonia (=Asterolecanium) arabidis, damages and prefers ceanothus and Pittosporum tobira, but has a long host list.",
    "identification": "These scales are circular to oval and immobile except for briefly when they are recently hatched first instars (crawlers). Mature pit scales of most species are 1/10 to 1/20 inch in diameter. Pittosporum pit scale including its marginal wax fringe can be up to 1/5 inch long. The pit scales' color can be brown, gold, green, tan, yellow, or whitish. Generally the most distinctive feature is their damage, the round depressions (pits). The particular species can commonly be discerned by the hosts on which they occur. Agave pit scale, Asterolecanium agavis, in California has been reported only on Joshua tree, Yucca brevifolia. The large pit scale, Asterolecanium grandiculum, feeds on various Agave and Yucca species. Bamboo pit scale, Bambusaspis bambusae, most commonly infests bamboos (including Bambusa, Dendrocalamus, and Phyllostachys species) and is generally innocuous on its various other hosts. Euphorbia pit scale, Planchonia (=Asterolecanium) stentae, infests numerous plants in the Asclepiadaceae and Euphorbiaceae families. Euphorbia pit scale and the bamboo pit scale closely resemble the pittosporum pit scale, but lack the lengthwise fringe of white wax on top the body and at maturity are less than one-half as large as pittosporum pit scale. Euphorbia pit scale in California has been reported only in commercial nurseries. Pittosporum pit scale prefers ceanothus and pittosporum. Bush anemone, chaste tree, hebe, privet, and other plants can also be infested. See the U.S. Department of Agriculture's ScaleNet database for a complete list of the hosts of these scales.",
    "life_cycle": "Pit scales develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs generally resemble adults but are smaller and have less wax in species that excrete wax. Once crawlers settle to feed, the scales remain fixed in the same spot the rest of their lives. For the species with well-known biology, they have one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Agave pit scale and large pit scale cause discoloration and pitting of Joshua tree foliage. These scales generally are not abundant and not significant pests. Bamboo pit scale may occur in large groups on leaves and stems but does not make pits. Their translucent green to yellowish body takes on color of host leaves or stems where they feed, so this species is easily overlooked. Late instars (older nymphs) excrete a waxy fringe around their body, causing them to resemble certain species of whiteflies. Oak pit scales can severely damage oaks. Distortion caused by their feeding is most noticeable on the bark of younger twigs. Surrounding the feeding pit is formed a doughnut-shaped swelling with the scale in the center. If there are large numbers of scales, the pits coalesce, making the twig surface appear dimpled and roughened. Feeding by oak pit scales can kill twigs, and the dead leaves remain on infested twigs through the winter. Abundant scales feeding year after year can kill young oaks and stunt the growth of older trees. Pittosporum pit scale leaves ring-shaped depressions in bark and causes twigs to become distorted and swollen. The scale commonly congregates on the growing tips where plant distortion can be so severe their feeding obliterates the individual pits. Infested leaves may be smaller than normal and twigs may die back.",
    "solutions": "Agave pit scale, bamboo pit scale, and large pit scale are generally innocuous and no control is warranted. Oak pit scales and pit-making pittosporum scale can be controlled by thoroughly spraying terminals with horticultural oil in late winter or early spring, before buds open or new leaves are produced. Where infestations are severe, annual application of oil or adding a persistent insecticide such as bifenthrin or other pyrethroid may be needed to sufficiently reduce the abundance of scales and severity of their damage.

    "identification": "",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damage": "Pinewood nematodes feed in the vascular tissue of twigs, stems, and trunks. Pines are most seriously affected, but other conifers including cedar, larch, and spruce are also hosts. Pinewood nematodes are spread primarily by juveniles \"hitchhiking\" on adult roundheaded borers or longhorned beetles. The beetles feed as larvae beneath bark and pupate in wood, then emerge from dead or dying trees as adults contaminated with nematodes. Before laying their eggs in unhealthy trees, adult beetles may fly to other pines to feed on foliage; nematodes can then leave the beetles and infect the new tree. If beetles feed on the foliage of healthy plants, the introduced nematodes may eventually contribute to the decline of that plant as they reproduce within the tree. Branch dieback is the most common symptom in native pines infested with pinewood nematodes. The unhealthy trees in which they are found have typically been damaged by other causes, such as root disease or improper care, and the nematodes may be a secondary invader.",

    "identification": "From a distance, palm leaf skeletonizer damage appears as brown splotches on the leaves. Close examination reveals that caterpillars have fed on the underside of fronds, leaving the veins intact. As feeding expands, the brown splotches enlarge. The pale-brown or cream-colored larva grows up to 3/5 inch long and feeds hidden with up to 100 other larvae in a tube of dark brown excrement. The gray to yellowish brown, night-flying moths are 1/4 inch long and as with the tiny eggs are easily overlooked.",
    "life_cycle": "The adults (moths) live 3 to 10 days, and they do not feed on palm leaves. Female moths lay masses of eggs in pinnae (leaflets) or segment folds of newly expanding leaves. The caterpillars (larvae) feed on and chew the surface of leaf tissue, causing skeletonization. As larvae feed, they spin a tough, long, silk tube in which and outside of they deposit their fine, brown frass. The caterpillars live in colonies of 35 to 100 individuals within a common tube. They are present throughout the year and can complete five generations per year in warm areas like Florida.",
    "damage": "Palm leaf skeletonizer attacks various palms, including Phoenix and Washingtonia spp. Larvae chew the surface of palm leaves, causing dark discolored blotches on leaves. Infested fronds become dry and brown and eventually die. Infested palms may appear unsightly, but are rarely killed by caterpillar feeding.",
    "solutions": "In an effort to eradicate this pest, palms are monitored and infested fronds are pruned off, sealed securely in plastic bags, and properly disposed of. After pruning off infestations, palms are sprayed with insecticide. Buy only pest-free plants from reputable local nurseries. Because the palm leaf skeletonizer likely arrived in California on nursery stock shipped from the southeastern United States, be especially vigilant looking for this pest on imported plants. If you find suspected palm leaf skeletonizers, report this to the county agricultural commissioner. See The Biology and Management of Landscape Palms from the University of California and The Palm Leaf Skeletonizer (PDF) by the University of Florida for more information.",

    "identification": "Planthoppers are usually 1/2 inch or less in length and have several large spines on the hind legs. Adults commonly have a keel, ridge, or snoutlike projection on the front of the head. Nymphs of some species excrete pale wax on plant parts where they feed. Adult females of some species also cover their egg laying sites with white wax or other excretions. Planthoppers can be difficult to distinguish from many leafhoppers and spittlebugs, but in comparison planthoppers generally are broader with flatter sides. The location of antennae (below each eye on the sides of the head) distinguishes planthoppers from most other sucking insects. For example, leafhopper, spittlebug, and treehopper antennae occur between or in front of the eyes.",

    "description": "At least ten Pissodes species of conifer twig weevils, or bark weevils, chew and feed on conifers in California. Hosts differ by the species of weevil and include Douglas-fir, pine, spruce, and true fir. Monterey pine weevil, Pissodes radiata, and certain other Pissodes spp. as larvae mostly feed beneath bark of the root crown and basal trunk of conifers that are already injured, severely stressed, or dying from other causes. Species such as white pine weevil, P. strobi, that feeds on young pine and spruce mainly bore in and kill shoot terminals of otherwise healthy hosts.",
    "identification": "Adults and mature larvae of Pissodes species are 1/6 to 1/4 inch long. Adults have an elongated head and mouthparts and distinct, bent antennae. Adults can fly, unlike those of certain other weevils. Adult white pine weevils are blackish with reddish-brown and white blotches and spots on the wing covers (elytra). Adults of some other Pissodes species are mostly brownish overall, have differently colored markings (e.g., yellow), or both. The oblong eggs are pale yellowish and occur under bark. The larvae are white to pale yellowish with a brown head capsule and occur under bark. When disturbed or exposed they commonly have a C-shaped posture. Note there are numerous potential causes of bark cankers and dying conifer shoots. See the table of symptom comparison in Pest Notes: Pitch Moths to help discriminate the likely cause(s) of damage to pines. To confirm that larvae of white pine weevil or other Pissodes spp. are the cause, cut or peel off bark from affected shoots and look for the presence of the insects, their tunnels, or the pupal chambers covered in wood fiber that persist after the adults emerge. Feeding by woodpeckers and their flaking off of bark can indicate that boring insects are present. ",
    "life_cycle": "Weevils develop through four life stages: adult, egg, larva, and pupa. In about April and May, adult white pine weevils puncture feed on terminal growth of the preceding year. In May and June, the females lay eggs in these terminals. The developing larvae feed beneath bark and the twig-boring species girdle and kill the main terminal (leader), but not until the new growth of the current year has elongated considerably. Small areas of oozing pitch may be visible on infested terminals. By late summer, the infested shoots wilt, then needles turn reddish and may drop prematurely. From August through fall, new adults emerge, chew and feed on shoots, then overwinter in organic litter on the ground. Some portion of the population may overwinter as mature larvae beneath bark, then in spring pupate and emerge as adults. There is one generation per year. Multiple life stages can be present at the same time during much of the year. ",
    "damage": "Adults of Pissodes species chew foliage of small shoots, generally causing only minor damage. Larvae of white pine weevil feed and chew in the terminal shoots of pine and spruce that are about 6 to 30 years of age. These larvae bore in inner bark, vascular tissue, and the centers of small branches, stems, or treetops, killing the most-recent 2 years of terminal growth and stunting plant growth. Side shoots become new main terminals, resulting in severely distorted, bushy plants of reduced aesthetic quality. Some other twig-boring Pissodes kill only the current year's terminal growth, so the plant is less severely affected. Species that primarily feed under trunk bark are generally not the primary cause of tree damage; trees stressed or injured from other causes become attractive to the egg-laying adult females, which oviposit in bark near the soil line. The emerging larvae chew and bore in the root crown and trunk, causing unsightly cankers on bark. ",
    "solutions": "Provide valued plants with good growing conditions and proper cultural care. When Pissodes infest the lower trunk, identify and if feasible remedy whatever is the primary cause of unhealthy conifers that caused trees to become attractive to bark weevils. To help control white pine weevil and other shoot-boring Pissodes, prune off and dispose of infested terminals before the weevils mature and emerge as adults. In plantations of pine and spruce, such as Christmas tree farms, spacing trees more closely during planting can reduce the proportion of terminals that become infested. Insecticide application is generally not recommended for these pests in landscapes. See White Pine Weevil from Oregon State University for more information and photographs.",

Prune infested tips from October through January to prevent overwintering moths from emerging. Remove and dispose of clipped foliage to eliminate developing larvae and pupae on pruned tips. Consider planting species not susceptible to pine tip moth. High Nantucket pine tip moth populations can be reduced by applying a broad-spectrum insecticide to foliage to kill young larvae. The repeated spraying necessary to provide good control is not justified unless trees are of especially high aesthetic value, such as in Christmas tree plantations.

Whether any Rhynchophorus species in addition to South American palm weevil will become established in California is unknown.",
    "identification": "Adults are large snout beetles (family Curculionidae) about 1-1/2 inches long. Their color is variable and includes black overall, black with a red stripe, orange with black spots, or dark with colored blotches on the pronotum (topside behind the head). Larvae grow up to 2 inches long and are legless, plump, and yellowish to white with a brown head. Mature larvae (prepupae) and pupae occur in a chamber of coarse palm fibers in tissue where they fed as larvae. Unless the trunk and especially the growing point at the top of the trunk are regularly examined (e.g., from a lift-bucket truck) infestations can be easily overlooked until palms are irrecoverably damaged. Periodically inspect trunks and use binoculars to observe fronds and detect any chewing damage that can indicate infestation by giant palm weevil. If dieback of the apical (center, newest, uppermost) leaves is observed, carefully inspect their base for larval mines and frass (excrement). When trimming palms, direct workers to look for weevil life stages and signs of their presence. Indications of giant palm weevil infestation include a fermented odor from the upper trunk empty pupal cases or dead weevil adults around the base of palms gnawing sounds from trunks, caused by the large larvae chewing inside truncated or cut-off leaf tips, which may be visible from the ground using binoculars tunnel openings on the trunk or base of fronds that exude chewed plant material or viscous liquid weevil adults, which can be caught in special traps Be sure to distinguish introduced Rhynchophorus weevils from the native giant palm borer, Dinapate wrighti, Bostrichidae; their adults and larvae can be the same color and length. Giant palm borer is a secondary pest that infests palms after they become severely stressed or are already dying. Adults of giant palm borer are cylindrical with a bulbous head that lacks the elongated mouthparts of weevils. Unlike weevil larvae, larvae of giant palm borer have prominent legs.",
    "life_cycle": "Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults live about 2 to 3 months feeding on palms and going through several cycles of mating and egg laying. Adult females use their long mouthparts to chew a hole into palm tissue and lay eggs into the hole. Egg laying commonly is done in cracks and crevices and wounds in the trunk, from the collar region near the roots up to the base of frond petioles and the leaf crown. Each female lays several dozen to a few hundred eggs, which hatch in about 1 to 6 days. Emerging larvae chew and feed on palm tissue and bore into the center of the palm. Their tunnels fill with frass (excrement) and plant sap. Larvae develop through 3 to 7 increasingly larger instars for about 2 months. Mature larvae pupate in cocoons of palm fibers in the trunk or base of palm fronds. The pupal stage lasts from about 11 to 45 days. One generation from egg to adult takes 45 to 140 days, the shorter period when temperatures are warmer. Palm weevils have several generations per year. ",
    "damage": "Adults chew and feed on fronds, giving them a ragged appearance that reduces the aesthetic value of palms. Chewing damage weakens plants if feeding is extensive. The most serious damage is from larval feeding. Larvae chew and feed in the apical growing point of Canary Island date palm and in the trunk and root collar (basal trunk) of various date palms. Larvae damage or kill fronds by chewing in tissue where fronds attach to the trunk. This causes a sparse canopy of few fronds, seriously weakens the trunk structure, and can kill date palms and cause collapse of the crown. Heavily infested date palms may break at the trunk. When Canary Island date palm is heavily fed upon, the entire leaf crown may drop.",
    "solutions": "Do not bring palms or other plants into California unless you know they were inspected by agricultural officials or certified to be pest free. Report any suspected findings of giant palm weevils to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner. Use good sanitation to prevent palm weevils from spreading from infested palms. Where palms are found to be infested with giant palm weevils, remove the plant and burn, chip, or deeply bury the infested material. Plant resistant species, such as the native California fan palm (Washingtonia filifera), European fan palm (Chamaerops humilis), or non-palm species.",

    "description": "Among the most effective natural enemies of aphids are various species of parasitic wasps that lay their eggs inside aphids. The wasp larva hatches and feeds internally on the aphid, killing it shortly before pupating. The skin of the dead aphid turns crusty and golden brown or black, a form called a mummy; the parasite larva pupates within, later cutting an exit hole to emerge as an adult wasp. The generation time of most parasites is quite short when the weather is warm, so once you begin to see mummies on your plants, the aphid population is likely to be reduced substantially within a week or two.",

    "description": "This armored scale (family Diaspididae) generally damages only poplars and especially willows. Populations are generally innocuous on its numerous other hosts.",
    "identification": "The cover of nymphs is silver gray and that of adult females is coppery brown to purplish. The covers are elongate and narrow at one end and wider and rounded at the other end, resembling miniature oysters. Mature females are about 1/8 inch long. Nymphs and adult females are found on bark, commonly in crowded clusters. Males of this species are not known to occur. At least nine similar-looking Lepidosaphes species occur in California. The look-alike purple scale, Lepidosaphes beckii, generally is common only on bark and leaves of citrus in coastal areas. Both oystershell scale and purple scale can infest broadleaf evergreens, such as boxwood, citrus, and holly. But unlike purple scale, oystershell scale does not infest leaves. The similar fig scale, Lepidosaphes conchiformis, generally is common only on Ficus carica. Fig scale and oystershell scale can both occur on elm, fig, and walnut. But fig scale occurs on bark and leaves and mature females are 1/12 to 1/16 inch long, noticeably smaller than mature females of oystershell scale, which do not infest leaves. Females of euonymus scale, Unaspis euonymi, and oystershell scale also resemble each other and both can infest euonymus. However euonymus scale infests bark, green stems, and leaves and the elongate, white covers of males are common; oystershell scale lacks males. ",
    "life_cycle": "Oystershell scale overwinters as whitish eggs under the cover of mature females on bark. The crawlers (mobile first instars) emerge in the spring after buds have burst. Nymphs develop through two increasingly larger instars. The scale usually has one generation per year in Northern California and two generations in Southern California.",
    "damage": "The scale sucks and feeds on bark. High populations over several years can kill twigs and branches on young poplars and especially willows. Prolonged, abundant scales can stunt the growth of mature poplars and willows and cause them to decline. Except for poplars and willows, oystershell scale is generally not a significant pest in California on about 150 other plant species it feeds on including alder, almond, ash, aspen, box elder, boxwood, ceanothus, fruit trees, holly, maple, sycamore, and walnut. See ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture for a complete list of hosts of this species and references for more information. ",
    "solutions": "Horticultural or narrow-range oil provide control if plants are small enough to be sprayed. Thoroughly spray infested bark when crawlers are active in late winter or spring. If plants are tall or located where spray may drift to adjacent properties, a soil drench or bark spray of certain systemic insecticides (e.g., dinotefuran) may be the best option.",

    "description": "Also called ivy scale or white scale, this armored scale (family Diaspididae) may be the most common scale insect in California. While unsightly when abundant it rarely, if ever, causes serious harm to plants.",
    "identification": "Oleander scale’s cover is nearly circular, flattened, and found on bark, foliage, and fruit. Female covers are tan to yellowish and at maturity 1/16 to 1/12 inch in diameter. The cover of immature males is smaller and translucent white. Through the cover, the male body is partly visible. The easily overlooked adult male is about 1/25 inch long and has a delicate, orangish body with long antennae and one pair of wings. Oleander scale resembles greedy scale and latania scale, but their covers are more globular or raised. The darker, raised bump (exuvia, cover of the earlier nymphal stage) of oleander scale is commonly near the scale's center; the exuvia of greedy and latania scales is near the side of their covers. It is difficult to reliably separate these species in the field, but this generally is not of practical importance as these three species generally do not damage hosts or warrant management. Note that cycad scale is another look-alike species and it is a serious pest of cycads, or sago palms (Cycas and Zamia species). In comparison with oleander scale, cycad scale on sago palms is lighter colored, more convex, and commonly oblong. Submit samples to an expert with the county agricultural commissioner or UC Cooperative Extension for identification if it is uncertain what species is infesting cycads. Greedy scale, latania scale, and oleander scale generally can be ignored, while cycad scale when abundant on cycads warrants management action. ",
    "life_cycle": "Armored scales develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Oleander scale overwinters as mature females, which produce crawlers (mobile first instars) beginning in late winter. Female nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages and males develop through four immature stages before maturing into adults. There are two to four generations per year in California.",
    "damage": "The scale sucks and feeds mostly on leaves, but occasionally also on stems. The pale scale covers can give foliage a crusty appearance, reducing aesthetic appearance. Otherwise, oleander scale generally does not damage hosts or threaten plant health. Oleander scale can infest over 300 genera of plants as listed at ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The most common hosts of oleander scale include aucuba, cycad or sago palm, ivy, oleander, and olive. Its many other hosts include acacia, bay, boxwood, fruit trees, holly, laurel, magnolia, manzanita, maple, mulberry, pepper tree, redbud, rose, yew, and yucca.",
    "solutions": "No control is needed to protect plant health. If unsightly, prune out heavily infested branches as long as this does not entail extensive removal of a plants' leaves and limbs. Numerous parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on oleander scale as listed at ScaleNet. Predators include the black lady beetle (Rhyzobius lophanthae), green lacewings, minute pirate bugs, and twice-stabbed lady beetle. To conserve (preserve) natural enemies and improve biological control, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Where intolerable, horticultural or narrow-range oil can be sprayed to thoroughly cover infested parts during the dormant season or when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in late winter or spring.",

Cynipid gall wasps also can infest rose and certain other hosts. The size, shape, and color of the galls depends on the species of wasp and host and the plant part infested.",
    "identification": "Adult cynipids are usually purple or black, small, stout insects that have clear wings with few veins. The appearance of galls and wasps and the part of the plant attacked often differ between generations. The abundance of cynipids and their new galls varies greatly from year to year. Certain gall wasps contribute to annoying problems, such as leaf or twig dieback or messy dripping. Certain Andricus, Disholcaspis, and Dryocosmus spp. gall wasps induce plants to secrete copious sticky nectar.",
    "life_cycle": "Oak gall wasps alternate between one sexual and one asexual generation each year. Several weeks or months after egg laying by the female wasp, a gall forms as one or more white larvae feed inside. Galls on woody parts and evergreen foliage can persist long after the wasp larvae have completed feeding and emerged from the galls.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Provide oaks with proper environmental conditions and good cultural care. No other management is recommended because gall wasps can be very difficult to control, and usually they do not seriously harm oaks. Gall wasps are naturally killed by a complex of fungi, parasites, predators, and competing insects (primarily moth larvae and other wasps) that live within galls. Cynipids are also preyed upon by various small insectivorous birds, woodpeckers, and small mammals. If nectar-producing gall wasps are the problem, controlling ants can gradually (over several years) help to dramatically reduce nectar-inducing gall wasp populations by allowing gall wasp competitors and parasites to become more abundant. In most situations, no controls have been shown to be effective. Certain leaf-galling species may be reduced by insecticides with systemic or translaminar (leaf-penetrating) activity applied in late winter to spring, or by a broad-spectrum, residual insecticide foliar spray timed to coincide with leaf bud break or the early expansion of new leaves. However, gall wasps are unlikely to be well controlled by any single treatment; sometimes insecticide provides no control at all. Avoid using residual, broad-spectrum foliar sprays because they can induce outbreaks of other oak pests and wash off and pollute surface water.",

    "description": "Oak ambrosia beetles, Monarthrum dentiger and M. scutellare, and the western oak bark beetle, Pseudopityophthorus pubipennis, infest injured and unhealthy California buckeye (horse chestnut), tanoak, and true oaks. These Scolytinae are commonly found in oaks dying from Phytophthora ramorum, the cause of sudden oak death (SOD).",
    "identification": "The first obvious symptom of infestation by these beetles is fine, powdery, boring dust and excrement (frass) that accumulates on the bark surface and around the tree’s base. Adult beetles push the boring dust out of small holes (each about 1/20 inch diameter) in the bark, and the holes may be visible on the surface of infested branches and trunks. The beetles can be discriminated: Oak ambrosia beetles produce whitish frass around their tunnel openings. The frass is whitish because ambrosia beetles bore deeply under bark, mostly in the pale-colored heartwood and sapwood. Western oak bark beetle adults produce reddish frass on the surface of bark. Their frass is dark to red because they bore mostly in oak’s reddish inner bark (phloem). The adults are small, dark brown to blackish, cylindrical beetles about 1/10 to 1/6 inch long. The larvae occur under bark and are white, legless, and have a dark head capsule. When disturbed and exposed the larvae commonly are C shaped. Be aware that oaks can also be infested with other similar-looking Scolytinae including the invasive shothole borers Kuroshio shothole borer and polyphagous shothole borer.",
    "life_cycle": "Ambrosia and bark beetles develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Except for the adults, all stages are found only under bark. In northern California the beetles have about two generations per year. Most first-generation adults emerge from hosts and fly during about March. The second generation emerges in about September. The adult beetles reinfest the same tree or move to find new hosts. Because beetles develop at different rates and from eggs laid at various times, some adults may be flying and seeking stressed hosts to lay their eggs in anytime from about March through October. Each beetle spends most of its life in the larval stage. The second (fall) generation of beetles feeds and overwinters as larvae in the host.",
    "damage": "These beetles do not attack otherwise-healthy trees that are vigorous. They attack stressed, dying, and recently dead hosts. Their tunneling injures trees' vascular system and weakens tree structure. Once trees become attacked by these beetles they have a greatly increased risk of structural failure (e.g., limb drop, trunk breakage) and are likely to die prematurely.",
    "solutions": "Prevention is the only available control. Plant only species well adapted for the conditions at that location. Plant properly, protect tree roots and trunks from injuries, and provide good cultural care. Avoiding inappropriate irrigation is particularly important. California buckeye, tanoak, and native true oaks are adapted to summer drought. They are readily damaged by frequent irrigation beneath their canopies, such as when turfgrass is planted underneath them. Remove hazardous limbs whenever they appear, but otherwise avoid pruning during the season when egg laying adult borers are active (March through October). Prune out and dispose of borers restricted to a few limbs. Remove and dispose of dying trees to prevent boring insects from emerging and attacking other hosts. Do not pile unseasoned, freshly cut wood near woody landscape plants. Freshly cut wood or trees that are dying or recently dead provide an abundant breeding source for many wood-boring pests. Solarize recently cut wood to kill most beetles infesting it. For more information, see A Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of California Oaks and the Pest Notes: Bark Beetles.",

After hatching the western oak bark beetle larvae mine upward and downward with the grain into the inner bark. Mature larvae pupate just beneath the bark surface, then as new adults chew individual, new holes through which they emerge."

    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/moncypressbkbtl.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "This sucking insect (Pseudococcidae) occurs beneath bark plates and in bark crevices on cedar, cypress, and juniper. Populations are usually innocuous in natural areas, but it can be a serious pest of Monterey cypress in urban areas.",
    "identification": "Infestations are indicated by the mealybug's cottony wax protruding from bark cracks. The tiny, mobile first instars (crawlers) are yellowish. Cypress bark mealybug nymphs after settling and adult females are round, bright red or orangish, and surrounded by a ring of white wax. At maturity, the female is about 1/16 inch in diameter. The adult male has a reddish-brown body, one pair of whitish, almost veinless wings, and a pair of long, white filaments at the rear. The male emerges from a small, white, saclike cocoon on bark. Incense cedar scale, or Monterey cypress scale, Xylococculus macrocarpae, during its preadult female (cyst) stage closely resembles the cypress bark mealybug. Both species can occur on the same hosts and are easily overlooked on the rough, reddish bark.",
    "life_cycle": "Crawlers may be found from April through November. Except for adult males, the mealybugs do not move after the crawlers settle; they remain tightly in cracks of the bark. Cypress bark mealybug has one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Foliage on infested plants becomes yellow and red and may die. Heavy populations cause dieback at the treetop, which gradually extends down the tree and may kill it.",
    "solutions": "If the insects are abundant and damage cannot be tolerated, apply horticultural oil to the bark in August or September. For additional information, see mealybugs or the Pest Notes: Scales.",

    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/PLANTS/INVERT/mincypscale.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "Minute cypress scale, an armored scale (Diaspididae), is also called cypress scale. It can occur on almost any conifer and is common on arborvitae, cypress, and juniper. Minute cypress scale usually is a serious pest in landscapes only on Italian cypress, Cupressus sempervirens, and in nurseries on various conifer species.",
    "identification": "The alternative name cypress scale is also applied to species including the cypress bark mealybug (cypress bark scale) and incense cedar scale (Monterey cypress scale). The foliage discoloration and twig dieback caused by minute cypress scale can resemble that caused by the larvae (caterpillars) of certain moths, including cypress tipminer, juniper twig girdler, and webworms such as cypress leaftier, cypress webber, and juniper webworm. These species can occur together. To help diagnose the cause of damage, shake foliage to see if numerous tiny moths are dislodged. Look for caterpillars and silk produced by larvae of these moths. The caterpillars grow to 1/4 inch or longer and chew and feed on or inside of foliage. Use a hand lens to inspect discolored foliage for the scales, which are 1/16 inch long or less and do not produce silken strands. The cover of mature females of minute cypress scale is circular, convex, and whitish with a brown to yellow center. The scale body under the cover is greenish and yellow. The cover of immature males is elongate, feltlike, and with longitudinal ridges; on the terminal of males' mostly whitish cover is the brown or yellow exuvia (cover of the earlier, nymphal stage). Juniper scale. Carulaspis juniperi in the field cannot be distinguished from minute cypress scale. Both species can be present. The covers of both species are circular to elongate, tiny, and found on leaves and stems.",
    "life_cycle": "Minute cypress scale overwinters as females, which mature and produce crawlers (mobile, first instars) in late winter and spring. Nymphs feed through the summer, develop into adult females or males, and mate. Males die by the fall and only females are present during the winter. There are one to two generations per year in California.",
    "damage": "The scale feeds by sucking plant juices from leaves (needles) and twigs. Severe infestations can cause foliage to turn yellow or brown and die. Although minute cypress scale is widespread in California, it generally is not a serious pest in landscapes. It can be a serious pest in nurseries.",
    "solutions": "Generally no control is warranted in landscapes where the scale's populations are commonly innocuous. Parasitic wasps, predatory lady beetles, and other natural enemies commonly feed on and kill the scale. If scale damage is intolerable or adversely affecting plant health, thoroughly spray infested foliage with horticultural oil when monitoring indicates that crawlers are active in the spring. Use a different, effective insecticide if the product label indicates the host plant is sensitive to oil damage.

    "identification": "",
    "life_cycle": "Mealybugs overwinter as eggs or crawlers in protected places on the tree, such as crevices in the bark. The yellow to orange eggs are laid in a cottony mass called an ovisac. The young nymphs, or crawlers, are oblong, whitish, yellowish, or reddish and may or may not be covered with waxy filaments. In spring, crawlers move to the base of growing shoots or fruit clusters and stay until maturity (late May or June). As they mature, mealybugs become purple and develop a white powdery wax covering.

Naturally occurring predators and parasites provide good control of many mealybug species, unless these beneficials are disrupted. Manage ants, which are attracted to honeydew and inhibit the activities of natural enemies. Removal of overwintering sites, such as loose bark, can reduce mealybug numbers. Populations often drop in summer. Mealybugs are difficult to control with insecticides and systemic materials may be required. On ornamentals, insecticidal soap, narrow-range oil, or a forceful stream of water can be applied to reduce exposed populations with minimal harm to natural enemies that may migrate in later. Mealybugs are sensitive to heat and their waxy coat protects them from insecticides. Treatments are usually not justified or effective on home fruit trees.

    "solutions": "Manzanita leafgall aphids are prevalent on new growth, such as that stimulated by frequently irrigating and shearing plants. Avoid fertilization and minimize pruning and other cultural practices that stimulate succulent plant growth. Do not irrigate too frequently or with excess amounts. Avoid applying nitrogen fertilizers to established plants. If fertilizing, apply no more than necessary and use slow-release materials to avoid stimulating aphid populations. If these aphids were not tolerable the previous season, horticultural oil can be applied to lower trunk bark when buds begin to swell but before they burst into new leaves. Oil application may be a good choice if plants are also infested by scale insects or other pests overwintering on bark that will also be controlled. Certain systemic insecticides can be effective if applied before leaves become galled, but may kill bees and natural enemies that feed on plant nectar and pollen.

    "description": "At least five Parthenolecanium spp. occur in California. These and several similar species of soft scales (Coccidae) were formerly named Lecanium spp., hence their common names. The species are now separated into the genera Eulecanium and Parthenolecanium.",
    "identification": "Lecanium scale nymphs occur on leaves and twigs and are oval-shaped and orangish to yellow. Mature females have a dark brown, hump-shaped, oval body and sometimes several ridges along the back. Mature females are 1/12 to 2/5 inch in diameter and usually occur on young twigs. On evergreen hosts mature females can occur on both leaves and twigs. Males of most species are uncommon or not known to occur. Male nymphs form elongate, waxy puparia (hardened skins) within which they mature into adults. Adult males have a reddish body, one pair of translucent to whitish wings, and two filaments projecting from their rear end.",
    "life_cycle": "Lecanium scales develop through three life stages—egg, nymph, and adult. Nymphs mature into adults in the spring. Each female then begins laying up to several hundred eggs. Eggs hatch into crawlers (mobile, first instars), which emerge from beneath the female's body during May to July. Nymphs feed mostly on leaves, then in the fall molt into second instars and move to overwinter on twigs. Lecanium scales have one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Lecanium scales suck phloem sap and excrete copious honeydew, which attracts ants, makes a sticky mess, and promotes the growth of blackish sooty mold. Lecanium scales commonly are not abundant, but feeding by high populations over several years can weaken trees and kill twigs and small branches.",
    "solutions": "Prune out heavily infested branches if few in number. Do not prune woody species so extensively that they are damaged. Conserve natural enemies by controlling ants and dust and avoiding the application of residual (persistent), broad-spectrum insecticides. Many natural enemies help to control lecanium scales. Common predators include lady beetles, such as Hyperaspis spp., Rhyzobius lophanthae, and twicestabbed lady beetle (Chilocorus orbus); brown lacewings and green lacewings; a predaceous sap beetle (Cybocephalus californicus); and predatory seed bugs (Phytocoris spp.). Frequently lecanium scales are heavily parasitized by tiny wasps including Aphytis, Coccophagus, Encarsia, and Metaphycus spp. If warranted, apply horticultural oil during the early dormant season (before mid-January) or delayed-dormant season (as buds begin to swell). Oil sprays are not recommended on plums and walnuts during the dormant season. If treatment of plum or walnut is warranted and soil moisture during the growing season has been adequate for good growth, apply oil precisely timed during the delayed-dormant period, after buds begin to swell but before shoots begin to elongate. Alternatively, wait until leaves completely open and spray the first-instar scales on foliage. If spraying during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers with several traps of double-sided tape wrapped around twigs. Apply oil when monitoring beginning in the spring indicates that most scales are early instars or when crawler abundance declines after it has peaked. If scale-infested trees will be sprayed and are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. See Pest Notes: Scales and The Scale Insects of California: Part 1: The Soft Scales for more information.",

    "description": "Larvae of this moth (Cosmopterigidae) are a pest of juniper in the San Francisco Bay Area, Southern California, and warm interior valleys.",
    "identification": "Twig girdler damage resembles the foliage browning and dieback of juniper from causes including cypress canker, cypress leaftier and cypress webber, cypress tipminer, minute cypress scale, and root and crown rot diseases. To help distinguish the cause of damage, examine plants closely for insects and the silk webbing produced by certain caterpillars. Look for discolored bark and cambium caused by cypress canker and darkened, soft roots caused by root decay pathogens. Dying branches caused by mice have bark chewed away in bands from lower parts of branches. Twig dieback at the edges of plantings may be the result of dog urine, which sometimes can be diagnosed by the characteristic odor. To confirm twig girdler as the cause of damage, peel bark from the branch where dead and living tissue meet. Inspect the wood for girdling tunnels containing insect excrement and one or more cream-colored, pink, or yellowish larvae up to 1/4 inch long with a brown head. Shiny, black to brown pupae about 1/5 inch long may also be found in tunnels. The twig girdler adult (moth) is about 1/4 inch long and shiny with mostly dark brown to blackish forewings. Adults are not often observed, but may be seen taking flight if damaged branches are shaken during late winter through early summer.",
    "life_cycle": "Adults are present primarily from May through June in the San Francisco Bay Area and March through May in Southern California. The females lay tiny eggs on woody stems. The hatching larvae tunnel in and feed for about 9 months from spring through winter. There is one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Tunneling by juniper twig girdler causes foliage on small limbs to turn yellow, then brown and die. This results in clumps of brown limbs among green foliage by late summer. Twig girdler feeding makes junipers unsightly, but does not kill entire plants in the landscape. Junipers specially cultivated in containers to remain small (bonsai) may be severely damaged.",
    "solutions": "Prune out and dispose of affected branches to improve plant appearance if their abundance is limited to small portions of the plant. Avoid planting Tam juniper (Juniperus sabina ‘Tamariscifolia’), which is very susceptible to twig girdler. Instead of Tam juniper or Hollywood juniper (J. torulosa or J. chinensis ‘Kaizuka’ or ‘Torulosa’), consider planting cultivars that are less susceptible to the juniper twig girdler. Effective control with a contact insecticide is difficult. Larvae boring under bark are generally not susceptible to insecticide. Applying insecticide does not restore the appearance of damaged foliage, which remains brown until new growth occurs. If damage cannot be tolerated, it can possibly be prevented by spraying foliage thoroughly about twice with a broad-spectrum, residual, contact insecticide such as permethrin or other pyrethroid to kill adult moths and prevent them from laying eggs. To help time applications, regularly shake branches of infested hosts from late winter through early summer to observe when the shiny moths take flight and are abundant. Generally, in Southern California spray in late March and early May and in Northern California spray in early May and late June. Be aware that urban uses of pyrethroids and certain other insecticides are contaminating storm drains and household drains; this causes pyrethroids to pollute surface waters at levels hazardous to aquatic life. Consider tolerating twig girdler damage in landscapes instead of applying insecticide.

Females are yellow and orangish with black bands and blotches during a short period prior to egg production in late spring. Unlike other species of soft scales it resembles, Kuno scales have a broad, internal 'lip' or shelf-like margin where the adult female attaches to the host; this lip is best seen by removing females from the host and examining their underside.

The elongate, translucent, male cocoons are 1/12 inch long and can be prevalent on twigs.",
    "life_cycle": "Nymphs overwinter on twigs and mature into adults during March through early May. Eggs produced beneath the female hatch during spring into crawlers (mobile, first-instar nymphs) that migrate to settle and feed on leaves during summer. Nymphs return to the twigs before leaf drop in the fall. Kuno scale has one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Kuno scales suck phloem sap from leaves and twigs. The scale is most abundant on plum trees in gardens and landscapes; it is not a pest on commercial fruit and nut crops in California. Rarely damaged hosts include cotoneaster, pyracantha, rose, walnut, and other woody Rosaceae. Kuno scales can become abundant quickly. They produce copious amounts of honeydew, which results in blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants. Feeding by high populations of scale causes hosts to appear water stressed. Prolonged high scale populations can result in premature leaf drop and dieback of twigs.",
    "solutions": "Control ants, which attack the natural enemies of scale insects. If the scale has been abundant, spray horticultural oil on branch terminals and twigs during the delayed dormant period (as buds begin to swell) or thoroughly drench the underside of leaves in early summer.

Also called Klamathweed, this inadvertently introduced rangeland weed is toxic to cattle and sheep. The beetle largely eliminated Klamathweed from several hundred thousand acres in California. Each year this saves ranchers millions of dollars in otherwise lost grazing land and poisoned livestock. Subsequently, other Hypericum species became popular ground covers and shrubs in California landscapes. These, especially creeping St. Johnswort, H. calycinum, are also fed upon by this leaf beetle.",
    "identification": "Adults are oblong and about 1/4 inch long with a downward-pointed head. They are metallic shiny and colored blue, bronze, green, or purple. Eggs are oblong and about 1/25 inch long. Larvae are plump and somewhat humpbacked. They are gray, orangish, or pinkish and grow up to 1/4 inch long.",
    "life_cycle": "Klamathweed beetle develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Each adult female can lay about 1,000 eggs during her life span of several months. Eggs are laid from fall through winter singly or in clusters on leaves. The beetle overwinters primarily as eggs or larvae. After hatching, larvae feed during late fall through winter and develop through three, increasingly larger instars. Mature larvae (prepupae) enter soil to a depth of about 1 inch during late winter and form a cell in which to pupate. Adults emerge primarily in April and May, mate, and mostly feed during spring and early summer. During hot, dry summer weather adults aestivate (are inactive and do not feed). Adults again become active in fall, feeding and laying eggs.",
    "damage": "Adults and larvae chew and feed on various Hypericum species. Larvae feed on lower leaves and the base of stems during fall through winter. Adults feed higher on plants, and their chewing damage occurs primarily during spring and early summer when hosts produce most of their growth flush and flowering. After being inactive during summer, adults feed to a lesser extent again during the fall. When Klamathweed beetle is abundant, ornamental species of Hypericum, especially creeping St. Johnswort, can be heavily defoliated. Plants in irrigated landscapes generally recover and the chewing damage is primarily aesthetic.",
    "solutions": "Provide regular, deep irrigation for hosts during the drought season, especially when temperatures are hot. Protect plants from injury, such as by avoiding compaction or other soil disturbances around roots. Vigorous host plants tolerate moderate leaf beetle feeding, and control is generally not warranted to protect plant health. Removing litter accumulated beneath plants in hot areas may reduce the survival of adult beetles that rest there during the summer. Keeping soil beneath plants moist during the spring may increase disease and mortality of immature beetles that pupate then near the soil surface. Applying parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) to soil beneath plants may provide control if applications are made during late winter, shortly before larvae pupate. Monitor the lowest parts of host plants for larvae to determine when to apply nematodes; pupation occurs after mature larvae are observed on foliage near the ground. If chewing damage has not been tolerable, foliar or systemic insecticides can provide control. Because foliar sprays should target young larvae, monitor basal stems and lower leaves for larvae regularly in fall and early winter if you are considering spraying insecticide. Bacillus thuringiensis ssp. galleriae (e.g., BeetleGONE!) selectively kills leaf beetle adults and larvae that consume sprayed foliage. Because of its short persistence, when young larvae are present make 2 applications about 10 days apart, thoroughly spraying the lower foliage. Other foliar sprays for leaf beetles include azadirachtin and spinosad.",

Lygus bug damage to fruit may sometimes be confused with stink bug damage. Lygus bugs can cause discoloration, bumps, or depressions on fruit, but without the pithy or corky and discolored areas beneath that are characteristic of stink bug damage.",
    "life_cycle": "Lygus bugs overwinter as adults in plant debris, in crowns of plants, and in uncultivated areas adjacent to the garden. Their favored overwintering hosts are alfalfa, yellow starthistle, Russian thistle, wild radish, sweet clover, wild mustard, lupine, and vetch. Adults mate in spring when the weather warms up and lay eggs on a wide range of broadleaf plants. Eggs are inserted into plant tissues flush with the tissue surface. They hatch in 1 to 4 weeks, depending on temperature, and there are five nymphal instars. The first four instars require 2 to 7 days each, and the fifth instar requires 4 to 10 days. Newly emerged females begin laying eggs in about 10 days. There are three to four overlapping generations each year.",
    "damage": "Lygus can move into gardens or orchards from weeds, especially when they dry up. They are a particular problem in beans, strawberries, and orchard crops, feeding on developing flower buds and fruit. Fruit may become blemished and discolored, deformed, or twisted and may develop depressions or pustules.",
    "solutions": "The best strategy for managing lygus is to remove sources of infestation before damage is likely to occur on the crop. Remove weeds adjacent to the garden before the crop is planted or before susceptible fruit or buds appear on trees. Insecticides are not usually necessary or effective in the garden. Insecticidal soaps sprayed directly on nymphs will kill them. Natural enemies attack lygus but do not usually control them.",

The oblong pupae are orangish to white and 1/10 inch long. Adult gall midges are delicate flies about 1/10 inch long with long, slender antennae and legs and a gray thorax with two black, lengthwise stripes.",
    "life_cycle": "Adults emerge from overwintering pupae in soil and most egg laying occurs during spring. By midsummer egg laying ceases, and plants often continue to produce new leaves that do not develop galls. Larvae require succulent new terminals in order to feed and cause galls. Pupation of the spring and summer generations occurs within the galls. In the fall, mature larvae drop from galls or crawl to pupate under the tree canopy, within 1 inch of the soil surface. There are about six overlapping generations per year in California.",
    "damage": "Infested leaflets form brown, green, or reddish galls. Heavily infested foliage turns brown and drops prematurely, leaving parts of branches leafless.",
    "solutions": "Avoid the Sunburst honey locust, which has bright yellow spring foliage. Sunburst readily defoliates in response to drought or temperature changes, as well as gall midge damage. Consider planting the Shademaster cultivar of honey locust, which appears to be less susceptible. Black locust, Robinia spp., are not infested by this midge. Several species of parasitic and predaceous wasps feed on this pest. Because the gall midge has many generations and the larvae and pupae occur protected in galls or soil, this insect is not easily controlled with insecticides. On small plants, narrow-range oil, or horticultural oil, sprayed to thoroughly cover terminals at intervals during about March and April kills gall midge eggs and can substantially reduce damage. To increase the effectiveness of oil, properly time its application. Beginning in early March, monitor for the presence of adults by hanging at least two yellow sticky traps in the lower outer branches of honeylocust. Inspect each trap at least twice a week using a 10X hand lens or a dissecting microscope to view and identify the adults, described above.",

    "description": "The pest, also named Asian woolly hackberry aphid (Aphididae), sucks phloem sap from Celtis spp. leaves. It is especially abundant on Chinese hackberry, Celtis sinensis.",
    "identification": "Check for the insects to confirm that the cause of honeydew is aphids. These aphids on green shoots and leaves occur beneath small, roundish, fuzzy, bluish or white waxy masses, each 1/10 inch in diameter or less. Their body is gray to whitish. Winged adults have distinct black borders along the forewing veins and their antennae have alternating dark and light bands. Citricola scale, Coccus pseudomagnoliarum, is the only other honeydew-producing insect that infests hackberry at annoying levels in California. It is most common in the Central Valley on citrus and hackberry. The scales are immobile most of their life and are easily overlooked. On leaves, the first-instar scales are often translucent and barely visible with the naked eye. Older scales occur on twigs where their mottled gray to brown color blends in with bark.",
    "life_cycle": "The aphid overwinters on terminals as eggs that hatch in spring when the new leaves flush. Adults and nymphs can be abundant on leaves from spring through fall. Throughout most of the growing season, adult females (which may be winged or wingless) give birth to live young without mating. In the fall, a sexual generation of winged males and females is produced. The aphids mate and females lay the overwintering eggs on bud scales. The aphid has multiple generations per year.",
    "damage": "The aphid sucks phloem sap and produces copious honeydew and wax on hackberry leaves. The honeydew and wax excreted by adults and nymphs typically become most abundant and bothersome during late summer.",
    "solutions": "Insecticides apparently are not warranted to protect the health or survival of aphid-infested hackberries. If the excretions are intolerable, foliage can be sprayed with horticultural oil. Alternatively, hackberry branch terminals can be sprayed with oil after leaves drop, during the dormant season or delayed-dormant season, to kill the overwintering eggs. On large trees, the most practical control is to apply systemic insecticide according to label directions, preferably as a soil application or bark spray during late winter or spring. Avoid injecting or implanting pesticides or other materials into hackberry trunks or roots. Chinese hackberry are susceptible to an unexplained, tree-killing malady; the cause may be a vascular wilt pathogen mechanically spread by unsterilized tools that contact internal parts of multiple hackberry trees, such as tools used to prune trees or inject them with chemicals.",

Distinct concentric rings commonly form on the cover as the scales grow. Mature females are 1/25 to 1/12 inch in diameter. In California, male greedy scales are not known and male latania scales are rarely seen; reproduction is mostly or entirely parthenogenetic. Greedy scale and latania scale cannot be distinguished in the field. Discriminating them requires expert examination of microscopic characters. These species resemble oleander scale, which may be the most common scale in California. However, the cover of greedy and latania scale females is more globular or raised than the flattened cover of oleander scale. The small, raised, somewhat darker area (exuvia, covering of earlier nymphal stage) of greedy and latania scales is to one side of the cover; the exuvia of oleander scale is near its center. The many hosts of greedy scale include acacia, bay, boxwood, ceanothus, fruit trees, holly, ivy, laurel, magnolia, manzanita, palm, pepper tree, pittosporum, pyracantha, redbud, strawberry tree, and willow. Latania scale has a similarly broad host list but prefers broadleaved evergreens and in California may be more common than greedy scale.

The larval stage lasts from about 3 to 9 years if infested plants survive that long. Mature larvae pupate just under the surface of the trunk in about April and May. Adults emerge about two months later, leaving holes in trunks about 1/2 inch in diameter. Adults fly mostly during summer and infest other hosts or reinfest the palm where they fed as larvae. At least several years are required to complete one generation. Generations overlap, and all life stages can be found in a host during much of the year. ",
    "damage": "Giant palm borer can infest California fan palm and date palm. Adults and larvae chew, feed, and tunnel in the main stem (trunk) and base of the leaf crown. At the base of the leaf crown females excavate a chamber that becomes partly filled with soft, thick, moist material composed of chewed fibers, excrement, and sap. Larvae form tunnels in wood that can occur up and down the length of trunks. Emerging adults leave holes in trunks. Fronds of infested palms turn yellow and the plants commonly die prematurely. Weakened palms may fall over in the wind. Giant palm borer is a secondary pest. It attacks hosts that are dead, dying, or severely stressed, such as from transplanting.",
    "solutions": "Provide palms with good growing conditions and proper cultural care to keep them healthy. Dispose of dead and dying palms, in which the beetles breed. No control other than good preventive care of palms is known.",

    "identification": "Adults are brown to gray, hard-bodied weevils about 3/8 inch long with bulging eyes. The shape and orientation of the head distinguish Fuller rose beetle from two other brown to grayish snout beetles that are also common in California, the cribrate weevil (Otiorhynchus cribricollis) and vegetable weevil (Listroderes difficilis). Eggs of Fuller rose beetle are yellowish, about 1/25 inch long, and occur in a mass of several dozen. They commonly occur in cracks and crevices of tree bark. In citrus, eggs can be laid underneath the sepals (button) of fruit. Larvae are plump, oblong, whitish to yellow, and legless. They have a brown head and grow up to 1/2 inch long. ",
    "life_cycle": "Weevils develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. All Fuller rose beetles are females that reproduce and lay eggs without mating. After hatching, larvae drop to the ground and live in the soil where they chew and feed on roots for about 6 to 10 months. Mature larvae pupate in the soil for 1-1/2 to 2 months. Adults emerge from pupae mostly during summer and fall. They feed at night. During the day they seek shelter in organic litter on the ground. Adults are flightless and reach the canopy by climbing up the trunk or branches that touch the ground or vegetation. Fuller rose beetle has one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew and feed on roots, but generally this does not threaten plant health. Adults chew along the margins of leaves, creating notches and ragged, sharp edges. Adult feeding is not a concern for plant health, except perhaps when the weevil populations are high and feeding on young hosts or plants that have been extensively pruned and are producing new buds and leaves. Adults also may chew blossoms, which along with leaf chewing reduces the aesthetic quality of plants.",
    "solutions": "A tiny wasp (Fidiobia citri, Platygastridae) commonly parasitizes eggs of Fuller rose beetle. The Fidiobia adult is a mostly black wasp less than 1/25 inch long. The adult female lays one egg inside each weevil egg. Fidiobia can parasitize up to 50% of the eggs in each Fuller rose beetle egg mass. In contrast to the pale yellow to whitish color of unparasitized eggs, parasitized eggs turn dark gold then blacken shortly before the adult Fidiobia emerges; parasitized eggs may persist long after unparasitized eggs have hatched. Feeding by Fuller rose beetle does not seriously harm established, otherwise healthy woody plants and generally can be ignored. Provide proper cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate insect feeding. Trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material (e.g., Tanglefoot) to trunks to prevent the flightless adults from climbing up to feed on foliage. First wrap the trunk several inches wide with landscape fabric or plastic, then apply the sticky material on top the wrap to avoid potential bark injury from the sticky material. Periodically replace wraps to prevent growth-restriction damage to trunks. If adult populations are high, trapping may help provide some control. No insecticides are recommended for this insect in gardens and landscapes.",

Sprays are not generally recommended, but may provide some control when treating adults of alder and bronze birch borers.",

    "description": "Oak acorns are commonly infested with larvae of filbert weevils (beetles such as Curculio aurivestis, C. occidentis, C. pardus) or the filbertworm (the moth Cydia latiferreana =Melissopus latiferreanus, Tortricidae). Less commonly in California, acorns are infested by the acorn moth [Blastobasis (=Valentinia) glandulella, Blastobasidae]. Larvae of some of these insects can also infest chestnut, hazelnut (filbert), other nut trees, and tanoak. Filbertworm is also an occasional pest of pomegranate.",
    "identification": "Compared to the slow-moving larvae of the filbert weevils, larvae of acorn moth and filbertworm are generally active when removed from an acorn. Larvae of acorn moth and filbertworm have three pairs of short legs; filbert weevil larvae have no apparent legs. Nuts infested with larvae of acorn moths or filbertworms can contain fine, silken threads, and filbertworm larvae commonly drop on a silken strand when disturbed; filbert weevils do not produce silk.",
    "life_cycle": "Filbert weevils. Adult females chew a small hole in the seed coat of acorns or other nuts on the tree and insert one or more eggs during summer and fall. Hatching larvae tunnel and feed on the nutmeat. Heavily damaged nuts may drop prematurely during summer. Larvae mature in fall to early winter. Mature larvae (prepupae) chew an exit hole about 1/16 inch in diameter and enter topsoil to overwinter. Pupation occurs in spring or early summer, then adults emerge. Filbert weevils have one generation per year. Filbertworm. The adult female oviposits on nuts. Eggs are laid singly and hatch in about 8 to 11 days. The emerging larva chews inside and develops through several increasingly larger instars. After acorns drop, larvae chew an exit hole and move into organic litter or topsoil where they overwinter as prepupae. Filbertworms pupate in a silken cocoon in spring and emerge as adults in late spring or early summer. In California there is one or (in warmer locations) two generations per year. Second-generation adults, if any, appear in the fall.",
    "damage": "Although harmless to tree health, larval feeding causes acorns to fail to sprout. Insect-damaged acorns can also become colonized by bacteria that cause annoying, sticky liquid to drip from oaks (drippy acorn, or drippy oak disease). When hazelnut, other nut trees, or (by filbertworm) pomegranate are infested, the nuts or fruit become inedible.",
    "solutions": "Filbert weevils. Adult females chew a small hole in the seed coat of acorns or other nuts on the tree and insert one or more eggs during summer and No methods have been demonstrated as effective for controlling these insects in gardens and landscapes. Insect abundance and the proportion of infested acorns or fruit vary greatly by host species, location, and year. Collect and dispose of dropped fruit and nuts in covered containers to potentially reduce the abundance of these insects' next generation. When collecting acorns for planting, inspect them and dispose of those that deform easily when squeezed, feel unusually light-weight, or have holes; generally these are not viable. Another method is to place acorns in a tub of water and discard those that float; larval feeding creates air pockets that cause infested acorns to float. Where filbertworm infests pomegranate, you can place out a sticky trap baited with the filbertworm commercial pheromone (sex attractant) to monitor adults. When filbertworm moths are caught in abundance, Bacillus thuringiensis or spinosad can be sprayed. Bacillus thuringiensis must be applied when larvae are small and weather is expected to be dry and warm for several days. A second or third treatment at 7 to 10 day intervals may be warranted because of its short persistence. Spinosad is highly toxic to bees and certain natural enemies; do not apply it to plants that are flowering.

Predaceous ground beetles are medium to large soil-dwelling beetles, often about 1/3 to 2/3 inches (8–16 mm) long. Over 2,500 species are known in North America. Their shape and color varies greatly. Adults are often black or dark reddish, although some species are brilliantly colored or iridescent. Most species have a prominent thorax that is narrower than their abdomen. Their long antennae have 11 segments and are not clubbed at the end. They have long legs, are fast runners, and rarely fly. Carabids resemble plant-feeding darkling beetles. Unlike darkling beetles, carabids have enlarged basal segments (trochanters) on their hind legs. Darkling beetles' antennae are attached beneath a distinct ridge on each side of their head; carabids lack this ridge. Carabid adults and larvae feed on soil dwelling insect larvae and pupae, other invertebrates such as snails and slugs, and sometimes on seeds and organic litter. Eggs are laid in moist soil. Larvae dwell in litter or in soil. Larvae are elongate and their heads are relatively large with distinct mandibles. Most species complete their life cycle from egg to adult in one year. Metamorphosis is complete.",

    "description": "This scale insect (Eriococcidae) is a pest only on elms, Ulmus spp.",
    "identification": "The flattened, oval-shaped, young nymphs are orangish to yellow when on leaves and vary in appearance on bark. Females and males occur on bark mostly at the crotches of twigs, in cracks, and on the lower surface of limbs. The mature female is brownish to dark red or gray. Her body is surrounded by a feltlike or waxy, white fringe that covers the underside and sides. On top the body, the cover extends partially inward as toothlike extensions. Male nymphs develop into elongate, whitish puparia. These cocoonlike, nymphal skins are usually found in groups isolated from the females. Adult males are rarely seen; they have a reddish body, one pair of translucent to whitish wings, and two filaments projecting from their rear end.",
    "life_cycle": "The scale overwinters as brownish, second instars on bark. Second instars gradually change in appearance and become wax covered as they mature into adults during February to April. A mature female may produce up to 400 eggs. Several eggs per day hatch into crawlers (mobile, first instars) from May through August. Nymphs feed on bark or the underside of leaves; those on leaves migrate to bark in the fall. The insect has one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Feeding by European elm scale can cause leaf yellowing and premature drop of foliage. The scale excretes copious honeydew, which attracts ants, makes a sticky mess, and promotes the growth of blackish sooty mold. When abundant over several years, the scale causes plant decline and the death of small branches.",
    "solutions": "Keep trees healthy so they are more tolerant of insect feeding. American and European elms are adapted to summer rains; provide adequate irrigation in areas of summer drought. Introduced parasites, primarily Baryscapus coeruleus and Coccophagus insidiator, attack European elm scale at some locations in California. Parasite presence is evidenced by the round emergence holes of adult wasps in mature female scales. Increase the effectiveness of biological control by controlling honeydew-seeking ants and avoiding the use of persistent, broad-spectrum insecticides. If the scales are intolerable, thoroughly spray infested bark with horticultural oil during the dormant season. A systemic insecticide may also provide control, but European elm scale in some locations apparently has become resistant to neonicotinoid insecticides (e.g., dinotefuran, imidacloprid); where neonicotinoid insecticides have repeatedly been applied to elms they may no longer control European elm scale. If spraying horticultural oil or another contact insecticide during the foliage season, monitor scale crawlers with several traps of double-sided tape wrapped around twigs. In spring or early summer, apply oil when crawler abundance declines after it has peaked. Because female scale density peaks in northern California at about 540 degree-days above 52°F accumulated from March 1, begin once-a-week monitoring of crawlers by about 400 degree-days if a foliar-season contact spray is planned. If scale-infested trees will be sprayed and are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. ",

These include oystershell scale, which is a pest mostly on poplars and willows, but can also occur on euonymus and numerous other hosts. Unlike euonymus scale, oystershell scale occurs only on bark and does not infest leaves.",
    "life_cycle": "Euonymus scale develops through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The scale overwinters as mature females, which in spring produce eggs that hatch into orangish crawlers that emerge over a several-week period. Female nymphs develop through two, increasingly larger immature stages and males develop through four immature stages before maturing into adults. Euonymus scale has two or three generations per year.",
    "damage": "This scale feeds on at least 29 genera of plants as listed on ScaleNet from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, but in California is generally a pest only on Euonymus species. The scale feeds on leaves and green stems, most importantly on E. japonica. Scale feeding causes brownish to yellow leaf spots, severe yellowing overall, and premature drop of foliage. Prolonged abundant scales cause the gradual decline and sometimes the death of E. japonica.",
    "solutions": "Where this scale has been a problem, consider replacing and do not plant E. japonica. Euonymus kiautschovica (=E. sieboldiana) tolerates this scale and E. alata remains nearly scale-free even when heavy infestations occur on nearby susceptible hosts. Several parasitic wasps and predatory insects feed on euonymus scale as listed at ScaleNet. Predators include an introduced lady beetle (Chilocorus kuwanae) that closely resembles the twicestabbed lady beetle (Chilocorus orbus), which also preys on euonymus scale. Adults of both predators are shiny black with two reddish spots. However, the spots of C. kuwanae tend to be deep red, somewhat rectangular, and located near the center of each wing cover. The spots of C. orbus tend to be more yellowish orange, round, and located more forward toward the head of the beetle. Larvae of both species are brownish with black spines. To conserve scale natural enemies, control ants, reduce dustiness (e.g., periodically hose off shrubs), and avoid the use of broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Horticultural oil controls euonymus scale if foliage and shoots are thoroughly sprayed when crawlers are active in late winter or spring; one annual application during several consecutive growing seasons may be needed to sufficiently reduce high populations of this pest.

This beetle was inadvertently introduced from the Caribbean and occurs in at least coastal areas of Los Angeles, Orange, and San Diego Counties.",
    "identification": "Adults are hard bodied and about 3/8 to 3/4 inch long with a long, tapered head and mouthparts. Coloration varies greatly and ranges from black to gray, orange, or yellow. Adults are commonly a mix of colors including blackish streaks. Adults can live 4 to 5 months, during which time a female can lay more than 1,000 eggs. Eggs are oval, whitish, and about 1/25 inch long. They occur in groups of two to several dozen laid in a single layer in a gelatinous mass between leaves glued together. Larvae are legless grubs with a brown head. They grow up to 1 inch long while developing through 10 or 11 increasingly larger instars over a period of 4 to 15 months. Pupae occur in a soil cell. Monitor to confirm weevil presence. Dig and scrape away soil at the base of plants suspected of infestation and look for chewed roots and root crowns and the soil-dwelling weevil larvae and pupae. Examine hosts for chewed and notched leaves, frass (weevil excrement), and leaves glued together. Open glued leaves to observe whether diaprepes eggs are present. Place out special diaprepes traps. These consist of a base of black vanes that rest on the ground and as with a tree trunk induce adults to walk up and be caught in an inverted cup. Place tentlike metal screens under canopies and inspect inside these regularly for captured adults that emerged from soil.",
    "life_cycle": "Diaprepes root weevil develops through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. After hatching the larvae drop to the soil and move briefly on the surface before boring in to chew and feed on roots and root crowns. After feeding for several months, larvae mature and pupate in soil. Adults will not emerge from compacted, dry soil; adult emergence commonly occurs after irrigation or rainfall.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew roots and the root crown, causing severe decline or death of infested hosts. The nocturnal adults chew mostly young, tender leaves from the edges, causing irregular or semicircular notches and leaving dark frass (droppings) on foliage.",
    "solutions": "If you find a weevil resembling Diaprepes abbreviatus in an area where it is not known to occur, place adults in a jar filled with rubbing alcohol and take them to the local county agricultural commissioner or University of California (UC) Cooperative Extension office for positive identification. Parasitic (entomopathogenic) nematodes (e.g., Heterorhabditis or Steinernema spp.) can be drenched onto soil beneath infested plants to reduce larval abundance if soil is well drained (e.g., high in organic matter or sandy) and not compacted or high in clay content. Soil must be warm (at least 60°F) and moist (well irrigated) but not soggy before applying nematodes and for 2 weeks after application. If warranted, irrigate every 2 to 3 days after applying nematodes to soil. During hot weather, apply nematodes in the early morning or evening. Applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) to soil or trunks may control both adults and larvae. Foliar sprays are generally not recommended because of limited efficacy and adults move between numerous plant species. If plants are especially susceptible to foliage damage, a persistent, broad-spectrum insecticide can be sprayed on leaves, such as carbaryl mixed with horticultural oil.

    "description": "Cypress tipminer is the most common of several Argyresthia spp. that tunnel in foliage of Cupressaceae. The larvae (caterpillars) of this moth (Argyresthiidae, or Yponomeutidae) feed mostly along the coast on arborvitae, coast redwood, cypress, and juniper.",
    "identification": "Cypress tipminer damage resembles that of certain webworms including the cypress leaftier, cypress webber, and juniper webworm and these species can occur together. Cypress tipminer damage may also be confused with foliage discoloring and twig dieback caused by juniper twig girdler and minute cypress scale. The larvae of cypress tipminer occur inside foliage and twigs and grow up to 1/4 inch long. They are yellowish green to pinkish with a darker head and prothoracic shield (area on top the first abdominal segment). Pupae occur in white, silken cocoons between twiglets. The adult cypress tipminer is a silvery, brown and whitish moth with a wingspan of about 1/3 inch.",
    "life_cycle": "Cypress tipminer has four stages of development—egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Adults can be found mostly from March through May in Southern California and during April and May in Northern California. Females lay flattened, ovoid eggs on green tips. The eggs soon hatch and larvae chew into branch tips and terminal foliage where they feed during summer through winter. During winter to spring, mature larvae exit mines to pupate on twiglets. Adults soon emerge and mate and the females lay eggs on hosts. There is one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew inside foliage and small twigs, causing foliage to turn yellow, then brown and die. High populations of the tipminer can cause most of the plant's foliage to discolor. However, feeding damage is commonly limited to scattered, small areas of a plant. Foliage infested with cypress tipminer turns yellow in early winter and brown by late winter or early spring. The green color of plants is restored by new growth in the spring and summer. Although unsightly, even severe infestations do not kill plants. When growing in a nursery the discolored plants become unmarketable.",
    "solutions": "Where foliage damage from cypress tipminer cannot be tolerated, consider replacing plants especially susceptible to this pest. High populations of cypress tipminers and their damage that are intolerable can be reduced by applying a systemic insecticide (e.g., imidacloprid) in mid to late winter or spraying a broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticide (e.g., carbaryl) when adult moths are active. This reduces foliage browning the next year. If hosts may be sprayed, examine foliage tips for the cocoons beginning in late winter. When cocoons appear, vigorously shake branches and watch to see if tiny, silvery moths fly from the foliage. One application to foliage can be made when a large number of tip moths appear, between March and May.

    "description": "At least six species of Susana sawflies (Tenthredinidae) in California feed as larvae on cypress, juniper, or both. Arborvitae and western red cedar are less-commonly fed upon hosts. Cypress sawfly, S. cupressi, is the most common pest and primarily occurs along the coast and in southern California.",
    "identification": "Sawflies are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the adult females' sawlike, abdominal appendage for inserting eggs into plant tissue. Adults are about 1/3 inch long and have a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Adults are stout and mostly black with some orange and yellow that varies by gender and species. Larvae are grayish green with a wrinkled surface and rows of whitish dots and at maturity are 2/3 to 4/5 inch long. Susana larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two through eight (seven pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Five or fewer abdominal segments have pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. Acantholyda and Neodiprion sawflies also feed on conifers and more than one species can occur together. Neodiprion species chew and feed openly on foliage, mostly on pines, and have relatively smooth skin in comparison with the wrinkled surface of Susana sawflies. Species of Acantholyda feed within silk nests and are called webspinning sawflies, or false webworms.",
    "life_cycle": "Cypress and juniper sawflies feed as larvae during late winter to early summer. Larvae develop through five or six, increasingly larger instars (growth stages) as they feed and chew foliage. Larvae mature by early summer, then drop to the ground. Each mature larva (prepupa) forms a cell in topsoil where it overwinters in a brownish, oval, papery cocoon. Pupation and adult emergence occur during late winter and spring. Adults emerge and mate, and females insert eggs in foliage mostly during February and March in southern California and about one month later in the San Francisco Bay Area. Susana species have one generation per year.",
    "damage": "The larvae chew foliage, often in groups. When abundant, they cause hosts to have a sparse canopy of clipped foliage and patches of bare stems. Although abundant larvae make plants unsightly, otherwise-healthy hosts tolerate the loss of some foliage. However, if conifers lose most of their foliage they may die, especially small or young hosts and those already unhealthy from other causes. Cypress and juniper sawfly numbers are low during most years, in part because they have many natural enemies. Sawfly feeding commonly is innocuous to moderate and this generally does not threaten the long-term health of plants.",
    "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on a small portion of the plant. The larvae are relatively easy to control if you thoroughly spray them directly with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap, neem oil, or spinosad. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) is not effective against sawfly larvae because they are not true caterpillars, which are the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera).

    "description": "Larvae of various bark moths, or coneworms (Tortricidae), bore in cedars, cypress, and false cypress (Chamaecyparis, Cryptomeria, Cupressus, and Thuja spp.) and other conifers. Infestations are especially common in Monterey cypress (Cupressus macrocarpa) in coastal California.",
    "identification": "Cones with holes, brown to red frass (excrement), and silk webbing characterize an infestation of coneworms (the larvae of bark moths). Cypress may become so severely infested that the frass, which is held loosely together by larval webbing, appears to drip from the cone clusters. On Monterey cypress, larvae of C. cupressana and E. hopkinsana are found under the bark, in cones, and occasionally on foliage; only an expert can distinguish the species. Epinotia hopkinsana mostly infests pines. Cydia cupressana is the more common species in Monterey cypress. Cydia cupressana larvae are gray to white, have a brown head, and grow up to 1/2 inch long. The adult is a dark brown moth with transverse silver and gray bands on the forewings and a wingspan of about 1/2 inch. The eggs appear as small, ovoid discs and occur singly on cones and limbs.",
    "life_cycle": "In relatively undisturbed, natural stands of Monterey cypress in coastal areas, the larvae feed almost exclusively in cones and are innocuous. However, in urban areas where soils are fertilized and irrigated, cypress grow more rapidly especially when young; this accelerated growth results in unnaturally thin outer bark where the female moths are attracted to lay eggs. Larvae tunnel and feed under bark in urban areas during most anytime of the year. Inside the cones, the larvae feed mostly on the scale tissue. They feed on the seeds in spring when the immature cones are small and succulent. Cydia cupressana has two generations per year, and overwinters as larvae and pupae. In coastal areas, larvae feed continually during the winter, and in January begin to pupate. Adult females, emerge, mate, and lay eggs beginning in March. Larvae hatch, feed, and increase in size from March through August. By late August, the mature first-generation larvae begin to pupate into adults. Larvae of the second generation appear beginning in September. These larvae and many of the later-developing, first-generation (spring) larvae will overwinter. There is much overlap between the spring and fall generations. Adults and eggs can be present anytime from March to November.",
    "damage": "Feeding by the larvae can kill branches, which sometimes die back to the trunk. Coarse boring dust is seen on cones, trunk wounds, and branch crotches. Larvae often colonize cypress cankers, but they do not cause the cankers. Cypress bark moths do not kill trees or seriously damage otherwise healthy cypress.",
    "solutions": "Provide plants with proper cultural care. Avoid wounding bark. Avoid fertilization and excess irrigation, which promote rapid tree growth and thin bark susceptible to infestation; bark moth damage is prevalent on cypress in landscapes apparently because of cultural practices. Direct control is not usually warranted. For more information, see Cypress Bark Moth on Monterey Cypress.",

    "description": "This sucking insect (Monophlebidae, formerly Margarodidae) can occur on many woody species. Its common hosts include citrus, cocculus, nandina, and pittosporum.",
    "identification": "The female body is orangish brown, and at maturity it is distinguished by its elongated, fluted, white cottony egg sac, up to 1/2 inch long. Eggs are oblong and red. The crawlers (mobile, first-instar nymphs) are red with dark legs and antennae. Once crawlers settle and begin feeding, they excrete a covering of yellowish to white wax. All nymphal instars are reddish shortly after molting, before they produce cottony secretions. ",
    "life_cycle": "First- and second-instar nymphs settle on twigs and leaves, usually along leaf veins. Third instars occur on branches. Mature female scales occur mostly on large branches or the trunk. The loose, white cocoon of immature males and the minute, red, winged adult male are rarely seen. Cottony cushion scales retain legs and can move throughout their life. The scale has two to three generations per year.",
    "damage": "Cottony cushion scale sucks phloem sap from the leaves, twigs, branches, and trunk. The scale usually occurs at very low densities unless its natural enemies are disrupted, for example, by application of certain insecticides. An exception is on laurel-leaf snailseed, Cocculus laurifolius, which often is highly infested with cottony cushion scale; the scale-eating vedalia lady beetle avoids this plant. When infestations are extremely heavy, feeding by the scales can result in defoliation and dieback of twigs and small branches and severely reduce the yield of citrus trees. Cottony cushion scales excrete honeydew, which causes blackish sooty mold growth and attracts ants.",
    "solutions": "A parasitic fly, Cryptochaetum iceryae (Cryptochaetidae), and a lady beetle, the vedalia, Rodolia cardinalis, are the most important natural enemies of cottony cushion scale. Both Cryptochaetum and vedalia are common where the scale occurs in coastal California. Vedalia predominates in inland areas. The red and black adults of vedalia feed voraciously on cottony cushion scales. The young, reddish vedalia larvae feed on scale eggs; more mature larvae feed on all scale stages. The orangish larvae of the parasitic Cryptochaetum feed within the scale; later their dark, oblong pupal cases may be seen there. This fly produces up to eight generations per year. Conserve natural enemies by controlling ants and dust and by avoiding use of broad-spectrum, residual insecticides, which can have a severe adverse effect on vedalia. If scales cannot be tolerated until natural enemies become abundant, apply horticultural oil to deciduous hosts during the dormant season or spray foliage when the tiny, reddish scale crawlers and young nymphs are the predominate stages.",

The species are named for a preferred host, most commonly a particular pine species. More than 20 species of Acantholyda sawflies (Pamphiliidae) feed within silk nests on pines and other conifers. These are called webspinning sawflies, or false webworms. Arborvitae, cypress, Douglas-fir, fir, hemlock, juniper, larch, and spruce are also hosts of Acantholyda or Neodiprion species or both. Cypress sawfly and other Susana species (Tenthredinidae) feed on arborvitae, cypress, and juniper.",
    "identification": "Sawflies are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the adult female’s sawlike abdominal appendage for laying eggs in plant tissue. Most conifer sawfly adults are 1/3 inch long or less and brownish to black overall. They have two pairs of wings with prominent veins and a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae are commonly brownish, green, or yellowish green overall and resemble caterpillars (larvae of butterflies and moths, Lepidoptera). Larvae commonly have a black or brownish head and increasingly develop contrasting stripes or spots on the body as they mature. Neodiprion larvae, especially when young, will feed several to a needle, often with their heads pointed away from the twig or their bodies wrapped around the needle. Larvae tend to disperse and feed singly as they mature. Larvae of Neodiprion have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two through eight (seven pairs) and their rear end is clasperlike. Five or fewer abdominal segments have pairs of prolegs on most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage. It may not be possible to distinguish Neodiprion larvae to species; what appear to be the same species may be a complex of multiple species. Look-alike species can be given varying names, such as that named both balsam fir sawfly and Douglas-fir sawfly. Acantholyda larvae spin nests or silken webs on conifer foliage. They feed inside the silk in groups or singly, varying by the species. Unlike openly feeding sawflies, these webspinning species have no abdominal appendages except for the clasperlike rear end.",
    "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages. They hatch from an egg, grow through several increasingly larger instars, pupate, and emerge as an adult. Adult females lay eggs in niches (notches) in needles. The sawflies overwinter as eggs in plant tissue or as mature larvae (prepupae) or pupae. Neodiprion species pupate inside a thin, papery cocoon in litter or topsoil. Acantholyda species generally pupate in an earthen cell in topsoil. These sawflies require one or more years to complete one generation. Some individuals may remain in the cocoon or soil cell as resting-stage (diapausing) prepupae (mature larvae) or pupae for more than one year; these individuals may be active and feeding on foliage during only one several-week period over a time span of 2 to 3 years.",
    "damage": "Neodiprion larvae chew foliage during either spring to summer, or fall to winter, varying by the species. Young larvae feed in a group on the outer tissue of mostly older needles, leaving the central ribs that later turn yellow brown and may break off. Later instars consume most of the needle. Infested trees have sparse foliage and only shoot terminals may remain green. Acantholyda form and feed within \"nests\" on foliage during late spring and early summer. The nests are composed of cast skins, chewed needles, and frass (excrement) webbed together with silk. Nests often persist after larvae are no longer present. Some species occasionally become very abundant and extensively defoliate hosts, most commonly small trees in forested areas and tree plantations. Otherwise-healthy conifers can be killed by a single complete or extensive defoliation. Widespread outbreaks sporadically occur in forests and can kill numerous trees. In California, sawfly numbers are low during most years and their feeding commonly is innocuous to moderate and not threatening to plant health. Although their defoliation is occasionally very noticeable, sawfly feeding alone rarely kills or seriously harms conifers in landscapes.",
    "solutions": "Natural enemies keep many sawfly populations low and can cause outbreak populations to soon decline. Fungal and viral diseases, insectivorous birds, parasitic wasps, predaceous beetles, and small mammals commonly feed on and kill sawflies. Clip off infested foliage or stems if larvae are on a small portion of the plant.

    "description": "At least three cochineal scale (Dactylopiidae) species occur in California. These sucking insects feed only on cacti, usually on prickly pear (Nopalea, Opuntia, and Platyopuntia spp.). Scale presence is undesirable on prickly pears planted as drought-tolerant ornamentals and thorny living fences and for their edible fruit and pads.",
    "identification": "Settled stages of Dactylopius spp. have a bright red body. Adult females are 1/16 to 1/4 inch long. Except for the pinkish crawlers and adult males, cochineal scales are immobile and covered with pale, sticky, wax. Their red color often is not visible unless the body cover is pierced. The delicate adult males have one pair of wings and two long thin tail filaments. California cochineal scale, Dactylopius confusus, females are imbedded in more profuse white wax secretions than the other Dactylopius spp. Once settled and feeding, it generally is not possible to distinguish one individual California cochineal scale from another. Opuntia cochineal scale, D. opuntiae, usually occurs in groups around the bases of prickly pear spines. The white covers secreted by each female are separate. Tomentose cochineal scale, D. tomentosus, produces much less wax than the other California species. Its wax is more transparent and consists of relatively straight filaments. The body of settled tomentose cochineal scales generally is visible through the wax filaments. Similar-looking species include the cactus spine scale, Acanthococcus coccineus, and A. dubius. Both Acanthococcus spp. form white egg sacs on cactus, which resemble the white covers of Dactylopius. The cactus mealybug, Spilococcus mamillariae, also forms white egg sacs on cactus. Its body fluid color is gray rather than bright red. The spinose mealybug, Hypogeococcus spinosus, resembles Dactylopius spp. It has a reddish body, but it is not as bright red. Spinose mealybug is seldom encountered in California outside of plant nurseries.",
    "life_cycle": "All species of Dactylopius have several generations per year. Female scales develop through three life stages (instars). Males have five instars. Female cochineal scales lay eggs, which hatch into mobile first instars (crawlers), each less than 1/25 inch long. Female crawlers are covered with elongate, stiff bristles that enable the insects to disperse on the wind. Once settled, females feed in the same place for the rest of their life and secrete wax that covers the body. Females molt (shed their skin) twice, and after the second molt are mature and ready to mate. Each mated female can lay hundreds of eggs over a period of several weeks. Male crawlers have fewer and shorter bristles than females, but can be wind dispersed. The immature males spend several days feeding and moving on the plant before secreting a waxy, open-ended, hollow cocoon. Inside the cocoon, the male molts into a stage sometimes called a pupa, although scale insects do not have a true pupal stage. Males then molt into a winged adult, which leaves the cocoon and flies to find a female to mate. Adult males live only a few days and do not feed.",
    "damage": "Cochineal scales when abundant can stunt the growth of prickly pear and cause chlorosis where they feed in groups. In addition to their fouling of plants with sticky wax and the red staining when their body is squished, prolonged feeding by abundant cochineal scales can cause severe decline and eventually the death of prickly pear.",
    "solutions": "If a plant is heavily colonized by cochineal scales, you can prune off and discard the most­ damaged pads, use a forceful spray of water to wash away scales' waxy covering, and spray insecticidal soap on the exposed scale bodies. Beneficial uses of cochineal scales Cochineal scales have been deliberately introduced in locations around the world. Biological control of weedy cacti. These scales help to biologically control introduced prickly pear. These cacti are undesirable where they displace forage plants needed for livestock and wildlife. At least four Dactylopius spp. were introduced into South Africa (PDF) to control invasive cacti. The opuntia cochineal scale was introduced on Santa Cruz Island, California, to control prickly pear that outcompete native vegetation needed by desirable wildlife. Natural dye. In Mexico and South America, the cochineal insect, Dactylopius coccus, has been cultured for centuries as the source of the bright red carmine dye. The cochineal industry was lucrative for several hundred years and peaked around 1876, when as much as 7 million pounds of cochineal were produced. The development of synthetic (petroleum-derived), aniline dyes caused a dramatic decline in cochineal production. Subsequent concern that synthetic red dyes may pose health human health hazards have renewed interest in cochineal scale production. Cochineal insects are still cultured for their carmine dye in the Canary Islands, Mexico, and Peru.",

    "description": "This phloem-sucking soft scale (Coccidae) is a pest on citrus and hackberry in the Central Valley of California.",
    "identification": "The tiny crawlers (mobile first-instar nymphs) are yellow with short legs. On leaves, the newly settled first-instar nymphs are flat, translucent, and barely visible with the naked eye. First instars become yellowish and plump by late summer. In the fall, nymphs become mottled brown second instars on leaves or twigs. In late winter (about March), the second instars on twigs enlarge and become mottled gray. Mature females are mottled dark brown to gray, convex, oval shaped, and about 1/4 inch long. Brown soft scale, Coccus hesperidum, resembles citricola scale. The mature brown soft scale is smaller, about 1/6 inch or less, and yellow or dark brown, not gray. Because brown soft scale has several overlapping generations per year, different-sized life stages commonly occur at the same time. Citricola scale has only one generation per year, so most individuals are about the same size, except when the crawlers are emerging from beneath females. ",
    "life_cycle": "Citricola scale occurs on leaves or twigs depending on the life stage and time of year. Females on twigs each lay several eggs per day beneath their body during a 1- to 2-month period in May through July. Eggs hatch after 2 to 3 days, and the mobile crawlers emerge. In northern California, citricola scale crawler density peaks at about 635 degree-days above 52°F accumulated from March 1. Crawlers settle to feed mostly on the underside of leaves. In severe infestations, crawlers also settle on the upper leaf surface and on twigs. First instars grow slowly during the summer. In the fall, nymphs molt into second instars and migrate to twigs. In late winter, the second instars enlarge and mature into adult females by late April or early May. There are no males.",

    "solutions": "Citricola scale is well controlled by parasites in south coastal California, but not in California’s Central Valley. Conserve natural enemies where they are present. If applying horticultural oil, spray the underside of foliage during about late July through early September, after monitoring indicates that most crawlers have emerged and settled. Alternatively, hackberry can be sprayed with oil after leaves drop during the dormant season. ",

The insects can look different depending on the host, and several different-looking stages of the same species can occur together.",
    "life_cycle": "Adelgids develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. Most adelgids have several generations per year and a complex life history that can include several types of adults with differing appearance. Their biology can include generations alternating between two different conifer species.",
    "damage": "Adelgids suck and feed on conifers and inject saliva that can cause host tissue to distort. Adelges and Pineus species cause white cottony tufts on the bark, branches, cones, needles, or twigs. Heavily infested trees may seem covered with snow. Cone-shaped galls or swollen twigs may develop on infested fir and spruce. High adelgid populations cause foliage yellowing, early drop of needles, and drooping and dieback of terminals. Prolonged high populations can retard plant growth. Vigorous plants tolerate moderate populations and most adelgid species are unlikely to seriously harm trees. Exceptions are balsam woolly adelgid introduced in Northern California and hemlock woolly adelgid in the eastern United States. Be alert for these serious pests and any unusually damaging adelgid problems on hemlock, true fir, or spruce. If suspected balsam woolly adelgids or hemlock woolly adelgids are found where not known to occur report the location the local office of the county agricultural commissioner.",
    "solutions": "Usually no control is needed to protect the health of established trees. An exception is the balsam woolly adelgid. See the balsam woolly adelgid section in Managing Insects and Diseases of Oregon Conifers (PDF) from Oregon State University for strategies to control this pest. Predators of adelgids are especially important in natural forests, where most adelgids are uncommon. Adelgid predators include brown lacewings, green lacewings, the small maggotlike larvae of aphid flies and predaceous midges, and adults and larvae of several species of small lady beetles. Replace some spruce with other species to reduce adelgid populations that alternate hosts. A forceful stream of water directed at the cottony masses on conifers, especially on trunks, dislodges and kills many adelgids. On spruce, to restore the plant’s aesthetic quality and provide some control, break off or clip and dispose of infested foliage when the galls are green and before the insects have emerged. Avoid excess fertilization and quick-release fertilizers, which can promote adelgid abundance. High adelgid populations, especially on young trees, can be controlled by applying horticultural or narrow-range oil, insecticidal soap (potassium salts of fatty acids), or certain other insecticides in the spring when crawlers are abundant. Be aware that oil spray may remove the desirable bluish color from foliage of certain conifers (e.g., blue spruce), but this does not affect tree health. Avoid residual, broad-spectrum insecticides (e.g., carbaryl and pyrethroids), which can cause an increase in spider mite populations unless a miticide is added. Insecticide sprays are more effective when a wetting agent is added and applications are made with high-pressure equipment so that the spray penetrates the insects’ waxy secretions. Certain systemic insecticides (e.g., imidacloprid) can be effective. Insecticide sprays are not effective in preventing galls unless application is correctly timed based on careful and frequent monitoring. Examine the base of terminal buds on spruce and locate the overwintering females. Inspect females regularly during late winter and spring to determine when they begin to increase greatly in size and start to produce waxy strands; at this time thorough spraying with insecticide can provide control.",

Inadvertently introduced from Europe, it more recently has become established in Oregon and northwestern California. This adelgid occurs only on Abies species and does not alternate hosts in the United States. The round, dark purple to black adelgids are 1⁄25 inch long or less. They occur under cottony wax on fir twigs and trunk bark. When infested, shoots become stunted and develop globular galled wood (gouting) around buds and branch nodes. Infested shoots and limbs die back and the firs gradually decline and commonly die. If you find an adelgid-infested dying fir or suspected balsam woolly adelgids, report the location to the local office of the county agricultural commissioner.

Nymphs produce a white, cottony tuft where each individual settles and feeds on cones, needles, and shoots. High populations cause needles to become distorted, spotted, and drop prematurely. Cooley spruce gall adelgid feeding can cause spruce terminals to distort into a gall that eventually encloses a group of the insects. The galls are 1/2 to 3 inches long and light green to purple. About midsummer, the nymphs emerge from galls and molt into winged adults. The empty galls harden, turn brown, and die and may persist for years. Cooley spruce gall adelgid produces galls on spruce only when Douglas-fir is nearby because this alternate host is the source of the adelgid’s gall-forming stage. Galls in California are mostly seen along the North Coast and in mountainous areas where Douglas-fir is common. For more information and an illustration of its host-alternating life cycle, see Cooley Spruce Galls from Colorado State University."

Within several feet of trunks, keep soil bare or apply mulch to avoid the common problem of lawn mower blades or string trimmers scraping the root crown or basal trunk. Where turfgrass or ground covers grow under tree canopies, irrigate properly to encourage deeper root growth. Use relatively infrequent, deep watering when needed instead of frequent shallow sprinkling. Where the fungus is known or suspected to occur, after pruning any Platanus spp. or using equipment that impacts trees, immediately scrub tools clean with detergent and water and soak them in a 10 to 20% bleach solution. Avoid unnecessary pruning. Except to remove hazardous limbs or dead trees whenever they appear, prune only during dry weather in December and January, when the cold inhibits fungal development. Promptly remove infected trees and dispose of the wood away from other Platanus spp. Consider trenching at least 2 to 3 feet deep around stumps to eliminate any natural root grafts to nearby Platanus spp.",

    "description": "These fungi infect junipers in some urban areas and cedar, cypress, and juniper in cool, moist areas of their native growing range such as the Sierra Nevada. Rosaceous species alternate hosts of the fungi (e.g., pear and serviceberry) can also be infected. Identification The most conspicuous symptom on conifers is the presence of dark green, tight bunches of shoot growth (witches' brooms) on perennially infected branches. The brooms are often scattered throughout the canopy of the tree or shrub. The largest and oldest brooms usually occur in the lower canopy. Some brooms can grow more than 3 feet in diameter. Small, round, reddish cushions that form on conifer needles in spring also indicate infection by Gymnosporangium spp. Later in the year, when these cushion-like, spore-forming bodies mature and become wet, they appear as orange, gelatinous masses. On the fruit, green stems, and leaves of the rosaceous species alternate hosts, groups of small, cup-shaped fruiting bodies containing orange fungal spores appear as pustules and are symptomatic of infection. Certain mistletoes could be confused with the witches' brooms caused by Gymnosporangium rusts. For example, Phoradendron juniperinum =P. libocedri, infects incense cedar and junipers; when viewed from a distance it resembles brooms caused by Gymnosporangium rusts. The mistletoe is distinguished by the presence of leafless, green shoots growing in rounded, clusters. The mistletoe's green shoots appear to be leafless because its leaves are only 1/10 inch long and lie scalelike along stems. Life cycle Gymnosporangium spp. require two hosts in different plant families to complete their life cycle. Most have four or five spore stages. The fungus on its conifer host produces spores in spring and summer. These spores disperse in air to infect the young tissues of the alternate host, a Rosaceae. The fungus grows in the alternate host and eventually produces airborne spores that infect the conifer host, usually in late summer or fall. Incense cedar rust, Gymnosporangium libocedri, also called cedar broom rust, alternates between incense cedar and mainly serviceberry, Amelanchier spp. Apple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, and quince are also alternate hosts. Damage Gymnosporangium rusts cause galls, stunted and bushy branches (e.g., witches' brooms), stem dieback, and orange gelatinous spore masses on conifers. The damage usually has minimal effect on plant health. Young infected conifers are often deformed and sometimes die, but larger trees are seldom killed, even though some growth reduction and brooming occur. Only when trees are heavily infected or exhibit extensive brooms do they suffer growth reduction and mortality. The lumber quality is degraded in trees grown for harvest. On their rosaceous species alternate hosts (e.g., apple, hawthorn, and pear), Gymnosporangium rusts cause nonlethal swellings and colorful spots on fruit, leaves, and twigs. The rosaceous hosts usually suffer little damage. An exception is when pear fruit become infected and deformed by G. libocedri, a disease named pear rust, or Pacific coast pear rust. Solutions Prune and dispose of infected conifer twigs and limbs in the fall, before spores are produced in the spring. Remove galls by making cuts in healthy wood below swollen, infected tissue. Avoid overhead watering. Removing nearby alternate hosts of the fungus may help to reduce new infections.

    "description": "This fungal disease of roses is usually a problem in California only in foggy or humid coastal areas. It can occur anywhere leaves commonly remain wet, such as where roses are sprinkler irrigated during the evening or night. Identification The fungus produces black spots on the upper surface of rose leaves and stems. Spots sometimes have feathery margins, and tiny, black, fungal fruiting bodies may be visible in the spots. Yellowed areas develop around spots. Infected foliage often drops prematurely. Life cycle The pathogen persists on living and dead leaves and on infected stems. Its spores are spread by splashing water. For spore production and infection, leaves must remain wet for more than about 7 hours. Solutions To reduce black spot, irrigate and hose off aphids in the morning instead of the evening or night. Do not plant roses too close together. Prune canopies to increase air circulation. Prune off infected stems during the dormant season and dispose of fallen rose leaves and stems away from rose plants. Avoid planting roses where they will not receive at least 6 to 8 hours of full sun. Choose disease-resistant varieties when planting.

    "description": "Camellia petal blight, also called Ciborinia petal blight, affects all cultivars of Camellia japonica. Camellia sasanqua is infected less often in California.",
    "identification": "Infection by the Ciborinia camelliae fungus initially causes small, brown, irregularly shaped blotches in petals. Spots enlarge rapidly until the entire flower is brown and dead. Except when wet, blighted petals are dry or leathery but do not crumble when handled. Blossoms drop prematurely to the ground, often as intact flowers. Prominent dark brown veins give infected petals a netted appearance. Damage resembling that of camellia petal blight is also caused by Botrytis blight, frost, old age (overmature blossoms), and injury due to chemicals, rough handling, or wind. Symptoms that distinguish camellia petal blight from these other causes include petal veins darker than the surrounding tissue, infections beginning near the central part of the flower (not appearing first near petal margins), and symptoms that occur only on petals.",
    "life_cycle": "Ciborinia camelliae produces dark, hard, irregular-shaped sclerotia at the base of infected flowers, where they replace the calyx lobe. Depending on the extent to which nearby sclerotia unite, they typically range in size from 1/12 to 1 inch. Sclerotia can lie dormant for several years on or near the soil surface. During winter and spring when camellias blossom, sclerotia produce light brown saucer-shaped apothecia (inverted mushroomlike bodies) about 1/5 to 3/4 inch in diameter. Apothecia forcibly discharge large numbers of spores that are carried by wind onto emerging blooms, where they germinate and infect flowers when they are wet. Pathogen development is favored by wet or humid conditions and mild temperatures (about 59° to 70°F) during bloom. Outbreaks are initiated by sclerotia-infested soil received with new plants and by sclerotia persisting beneath established plants that have previously been infected. Sclerotia continue to produce apothecia for 3 to 5 years after being introduced into soil and the pathogen cannot be eradicated once present.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Prevention is the best control. Remove the top layer of potting soil when new plants are purchased and replace it with pathogen-free soil. Plant camellias in a well-ventilated location and avoid overhead irrigation. Pull off infected flowers as they appear and collect fallen blossoms and dispose of them in a covered location away from camellias. Do not add camellia petals or leaves to mulch that will be used around camellia, even if it has been composted. It is difficult to expose camellia debris to the 140°F required to kill all of the Ciborinia propagules by composting. Each year, when blossoms are no longer present, apply a fresh layer of pathogen-free organic mulch and maintain a 4-inch layer of organic mulch beneath and somewhat beyond plants to suppress pathogen spore production. Remove fallen petals and other camellia debris before applying fresh mulch, but otherwise avoid moving or disturbing existing mulch where fungi may be present. Keep mulch thin near the trunk or several inches away from the trunk. Spraying an appropriate fungicide during bloom can help to reduce infections. Depending on the fungicide, reapplication may be needed every 10 to 14 days while conditions remain suitable for the pathogen. Use fungicides only in conjunction with recommended sanitation and cultural practices.",

Avoid overhead watering, which spreads the bacteria. Regular monitoring and properly pruning off galled parts help to control the disease, but prune only during the dry season, when the bacteria are inactive, and dispose of infected tissue away from hosts. It may help to limit pathogen spread if you scrub pruning blades clean and disinfect them in a 10 to 20% bleach solution before each cut, especially if plants must be pruned during the rainy season.

    "solutions": "Determine whether resistant species or cultivars are available and plant or replace plants using these. Many Syringa vulgaris cultivars are highly susceptible to bacterial blight and canker, while Syringa josikaea, S. komarowii, S. microphylla, S. pekinensis, and S. reflexa are generally less susceptible. Prunus spp. susceptibility to P. syringae is greatly affected by the rootstock. Less-susceptible or resistant rootstocks are available for cherry, peach, and plum. Because rootstocks that are less susceptible to certain pathogens are more susceptible to others, consult publications such as Integrated Pest Management for Stone Fruits to identify the best cultivars for the common problems in your planting situation. Prune and dispose of infected twigs and branches during the dry season; new infections are less likely to occur then. Do not wet foliage with overhead irrigation. Provide good cultural care, especially appropriate irrigation. Keep roots healthy, such as by planting on a broad mound of soil where drainage is poor.

    "description": "The fungus can infect all species of white (five-needle) pines and usually kills infected trees. Hosts include foxtail, limber, singleleaf pinyon, sugar, western white, and whitebark pines. Identification Initial symptoms include tiny, yellow spots and yellow mottling on pine needles, which later die and remain hanging on the tree. Infected branches swell into spindle-shaped galls. Infected bark develops raised blisters and becomes rough and cankered. A honey-colored ooze, then pustules of powdery orange spores develop on cankers in the spring. Infections are most common near the ground where humidity is highest. At sites with more fog, more of the cankers are higher in trees. On the pathogen's alternate hosts, currant and gooseberry (Ribes spp.), the fungus causes slightly raised, yellowish spots on the underside of leaves and young stems. Life cycle The fungus needs two hosts to survive, spending part of its life on five-needled pines and the other on Ribes. Viable spores that infect pines originate from the alternate hosts, Ribes. Trees are infected through a windborne spore landing on a water droplet on a live needle fascicle, or group of pine needles. The spore germinates and infects the tree by growing through the base of needles to the inner bark. Once in the stem or branch, the pathogen causes canker formation, and eventually girdling, which kills the plant parts outward or upward from the canker. Damage Infected pine foliage turns yellow, then brown and dies and remains hanging on the tree. Diseased tissue increasingly encircles (girdles) the infected limb or trunk and eventually kills it. Leaves of infected Ribes may drop prematurely. Ribes generally tolerate this damage. Solutions To avoid white pine blister rust, plant resistant or nonhost pine species. Cutting off infected limbs may increase tree longevity. Promptly remove seriously diseased or hazardous trees. Do not move Cronartium-infected pines or wood off-site because some parts of California are still free of this introduced pathogen. Removing alternate hosts of the fungus (Ribes spp.) within about 500 feet of high-value white pines may help to reduce infections if trees are relatively isolated from other white pines. Ribes removal is generally not recommended because of the extensive labor required. It is difficult to completely eliminate all the alternate host plants, and Ribes regrow rapidly from seed when the soil is disturbed mechanically or after fire. Fungicides have not been found to be effective in managing this disease.

These funguslike water molds (Oomycetes) affect many plant species. Phytophthora ramorum infects aboveground plant parts and causes sudden oak death and Ramorum blight.",
    "identification": "Root- and crown-infecting Phytophthora cause leaves to wilt, discolor, remain undersized, and drop prematurely. Twigs and branches die back and the entire plant, especially when young, can be killed as roots and vascular tissue die. Plants infected when they are mature grow slowly and may gradually decline. Small brownish lesions encircling feeder roots are an early symptom of infection. As disease progresses, the small, fibrous feeder roots become scarce. Where present, the small roots are black, brittle, and dead from infection. Woody roots decaying from Phytophthora alone are firm and brittle but eventually soften as secondary decay organisms develop. Depending on environmental conditions and the species of pathogen and host plant, sap that is black, brown, or reddish may ooze from darkened areas of trunk bark. Cutting away bark from the basal trunk and roots often reveals a brown or reddish streak, stain, or canker in infected wood with a water-soaked margin separating it from the healthy whitish or yellowish wood. Confirmation of Phytophthora requires sending an appropriate plant sample with viable infection to a diagnostic laboratory. Test kits that employ the serological (antigen-antibody) technique ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) are available for use in the field to confirm the presence of Phytophthora where research-based sampling recommendations have been developed.",
    "life_cycle": "Phytophthora spp. can survive in the soil for many years. They require high soil moisture to infect host roots, so the pathogen thrives in areas of excess soil moisture and poor drainage. The pathogen infects the smaller (feeder) roots. Infected root tissue develops spore-forming structures (sporangia) and produces spores (chlamydospores, oospores, zoospores). Phytophthora spores spread from tree to tree easily and rapidly in water as it moves over or through the soil and the spores persist in soil and water. Phytophthora spp. are commonly introduced into gardens and landscapes through the planting of infested nursery stock. After planting, disease develops and the introduced Phytophthora spreads in the landscape in drainage water and soil movement. Phytophthora also spreads through the movement of contaminated equipment and shoes and through any human or animal activity that moves moist soil from one place to another.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Use only nursery stock that has been certified to be free of Phytophthora spp. and obtain plants from reputable local suppliers. Inspect roots and reject plants that show decayed roots or evidence of crown rot. Prepare the site well before planting, use excellent sanitation, and provide appropriate cultural care, especially proper irrigation. Good water management is the most important factor in reducing the threat of Phytophthora root and crown rot. Where soils are compacted, drain poorly, or are often soggy, improve drainage and plant only species not reported to be susceptible to P. cinnamomi. Some pesticides (e.g., phosphonates) help to control certain Phytophthora spp. if combined with practices such as avoiding overirrigation and improving drainage. However, plants larger than medium-sized shrubs can be difficult to effectively treat in landscapes. For more information, see the Pest Notes: Phytophthora Root and Crown Rot in the Garden.",

    "description": "Phytoplasmas, formerly called mycoplasmas, are minute, single-cell organisms that resemble bacteria. Phytoplasma diseases are often called yellows because chlorotic foliage is a common damage symptom. Yellows of ash, elm, and lilacs and lethal yellowing of palm are important phytoplasma diseases that so far have been reported only in the eastern United States. Aster yellows complex is the most important phytoplasma infecting herbaceous ornamentals in California, but not woody plants. Identification Phytoplasmas commonly cause distorted, dwarfed, and yellowish leaves and shoots. Other symptoms include abnormal flower and leaf development, shortened internodes, and shoot proliferation (witches’ broom). The flowers of infected plants sometimes develop green, leaflike structures, called phyllody. Phytoplasma diseases in California include peach yellow leafroll of almonds, nectarines, and peaches; pear decline of pear; and cherry buckskin, or X-disease of cherry. Phytoplasma infection gives fruit a bitter flavor and abnormal appearance and causes trees to decline. The symptoms of phytoplasmas can be confused with those caused by viruses. Some phytoplasmas cause severe decline and eventually death of the plant. Many phytoplasmas are poorly known, and their importance as pests may be underestimated. Life cycle Phytoplasmas are often spread during feeding by certain species of leafhoppers. Pear decline is vectored by a psyllid, the pear psylla. The insects acquire phytoplasma during their sucking feeding on infected hosts, then spread the microorganism when they move to feed on other host plants. Solutions No chemicals are effective against phytoplasmas. Control these pathogens primarily through proper sanitation, excluding and controlling insect vectors, and using only pathogen-free stock. Remove infected plants that are a source of pathogens, including certain weeds. For example, burclover (Medicago polymorpha), clovers (Melilotus and Trifolium spp.), and dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) host the X-disease phytoplasma spread by certain leafhoppers. Scion and rootstock cultivars often vary significantly in their susceptibility to phytoplasmas. Seek information on resistant cultivars and plant them where phytoplasmas are a problem.",

    "description": "The fungus infects branches and trunks of two- and three-needle pines. Hosts include Aleppo, Bishop, lodgepole, Monterey, ponderosa, Scots, and shore pines. Identification Often infections are within 10 to 20 feet from the ground. Galled stems may exude sap. Galls sometimes become colonized by other fungi or insects or chewed by small mammals. Beyond the galls, foliage may become stunted and bushy, and the terminal may die back or break off. Flagging of branch terminals (needles dying and turning brown) resembles damage from pitch canker infection and certain insects (e.g., twig-feeding beetles). Western gall rust infection can readily be distinguished from other diseases and insect damage by the presence of the galls, when young each 2 to 3 inches in diameter, near the dead terminals. Life cycle In spring, young galls develop orange spores on their surface. The spores are spread from pine to pine by wind and if shoots are wet infect the terminals of the youngest branches or the mainstem terminal. Needles do not become infected. The fungal germ tube (outgrowth of a spore) directly penetrates the host cuticle and epidermal cells to develop a perennial infection in living tissue. Infection of the cambium stimulates gall formation. The fungus can remain alive as long as the infected host tissue lives, which may be from a few to many years on branches to the life of a long-lived tree for basal mainstem infections. Damage The fungus causes spherical swellings or galls, cankers, and dieback on branches in two- and three-needle pines. Some pines develop rust infection at the base of their mainstem. These trees if they live to an old age can develop a large depression on one side the lower trunk, called a hip canker. Solutions Prune and dispose of infected branches during October to January. Large galls on major limbs or the trunk can lead to structural failure; consider removing and replacing trees that may be hazardous.

    "description": "Viruses are submicroscopic pathogens that infect cells, changing some cell functions. Abutilon, camellia, Nandina (heavenly bamboo), rose, wisteria and many other woody landscape plants may show viral symptoms on occasion. Identification Viral pathogens are named after the main or first-recognized host plant and the primary type of damage they cause. For example, Apple mosaic virus and Elm mosaic virus cause an irregular pattern of discoloration in leaves on apple and elm, respectively. Hibiscus chlorotic ringspot and Prunus necrotic ringspot cause small yellow or brownish spots or blotches on the leaves of hibiscus or plants in the rose family, respectively. Damage is usually noticeable only in flowers or foliage. Infected blossoms or leaves may become discolored, distorted, spotted, streaked, or stunted. For example, the flowers of infected plants sometimes develop green, leaflike structures, as with rose phyllody. Life cycle Viruses can be transmitted by insects feeding on plant sap or mechanically in sap that is spread by hand or grafting tools. Viruses also spread in pollen, seed, or vegetative parts of plants, such as through budding and grafting during propagation. Once a plant becomes infected with virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. Some viruses have a relatively narrow host range and apparently infect only one genus of plants. Other viruses have a broad host range, such as Impatiens necrotic spot virus and Tomato spotted wilt virus, incompletely understood tospoviruses that infect several hundred genera of mostly herbaceous plants, including many flowering ornamentals. Damage Viruses can slow plant growth, but most do not seriously harm woody landscape plants. Herbaceous ornamentals and certain vegetables are more susceptible to serious injury or death from viruses. The variegation or other appearance changes that viruses cause are sometimes considered to be attractive, such as Abutilon mosaic virus. Solutions There is no cure or treatment for virus-infected plants in landscapes, and generally none is needed for woody ornamentals. Provide proper cultural care to improve plant vigor or replace infected plants if their growth is unsatisfactory. Purchase and plant only high-quality, certified virus-free or virus-resistant nursery stock or seeds. Do not graft virus-infected plant parts onto virus-free plants unless you want to introduce the virus. Although certain viruses are spread by aphids and other insects that suck plant juices, controlling insects is generally not a recommended or effective method of preventing virus infection in woody landscapes. It is very difficult to detect or control insects effectively at the low densities that can spread a virus, and to continually provide control throughout the life of perennial plants, especially of insects like the melon and green peach aphids that spread Cucumber mosaic virus in Nandina and feed on many different plant species.",

Taphrina spores (asci) can occur on either leaf surface; the felty colonies of erineum mites usually occur only on the underside of oak leaves. Microscopic examination may be required to distinguish confidently between erineum mites and Taphrina spores.

Lesions become sunken and tan and may have olive-colored spores around their margins. Severely infected fruit distort or crack and drop.",
    "life_cycle": "Scab fungi overwinter on fallen leaves and on evergreen hosts on leaves on the plant. Spores on infected tissue are discharged into the air or splashed by water, usually in the spring.

    "solutions": "When planting apple, crabapple, or pear, choose one of the many scab-resistant species or varieties. For example, Asian pears, Pyrus pyrifolia, are less susceptible to scab than European pears, P. communis. Remove and dispose of or thoroughly compost fallen leaves. Avoid sprinkling foliage, but if water does hit trees, irrigate early in the day so that foliage dries more quickly. Prune branches to thin canopies, which improves air circulation and reduces humidity. Various copper, oil, sulfur, and synthetic fungicides may prevent the disease if properly applied from about bud break through a month after petal fall. Spraying is generally not warranted except where the disease is severe on apple or pear fruit. See Pest Notes: Apple and Pear Scab for more information.",

    "description": "These fungi are named for the dry to gelatinous, orange, reddish, or yellowish fruiting bodies and spore masses that many species form on infected tissue. Rusts infect many hosts, including birch, cedar, cottonwood, cypress, fuchsia, hawthorn, juniper, pear, pine, poplar, rhododendron, and rose. Identification Rust fungi and their damage usually occur on fruit, green stems, and leaves of broadleaf plants or on the bark or needles of conifers. The host species and characteristics of the damage and fungal fruiting bodies and spores are used to identify rusts. Many species of rust have four or five types of fungal spores that differ in appearance and the time of year when they are present. Chrysanthemum rusts and rose rust cause discolored spots on leaves, which may drop prematurely. Gymnosporangium rusts on cedar, cypress, and juniper cause bunchy shoot growth (witches' brooms) and colorful raised growths or spots on foliage. On their alternate hosts in the rose family, Gymnosporangium rusts primarily cause leaf spots, but on pear sporadically damage fruit. Pine rusts may discolor only the leaves or needles, cause symptoms mostly on bark, or affect both bark and foliage depending on the species of host plant and rust fungus. Western gall rust and white pine blister rust cause cankers, galls, ooze, and roughening on bark. Foliage outward or upward from infected bark can become yellowish, then brown or reddish and drop prematurely. Life cycle Rusts infect hosts when plant surfaces are wet and temperatures are mild, mostly during the fall to spring or almost any time of the year in coastal locations. Rust fungi are spread primarily by windblown spores and when infected plants (e.g., from a nursery) are moved. Each species of rust is specific to certain hosts. Most species of rust fungi have several different-looking life stages and complex life cycles, alternating generations between two hosts in different plant families. Others, such as rose rust, Phragmidium mucronatum, and western gall rust are restricted to one host genus and spread, respectively, from rose to rose or pine to pine. Damage Infected foliage on broadleaf hosts may become spotted, turn yellow or brown overall, and drop prematurely. Infected conifers may develop bushy growth (e.g., witches' brooms), cankered, galled, and oozing bark and limbs, and spotted needles. Many rusts have minimal affect on plant health, but certain rusts can kill their hosts. The importance of rust damage varies greatly, such as depending on local environmental conditions and the abundance and nearness of other hosts that are sources of infectious spores. Solutions Avoid overhead watering. Collect fallen, infected leaves and needles and dispose of them away from host plants. Cut off and dispose of diseased shoots and branches as soon as they appear, except do not prune woody parts so extensively that plants are seriously damaged. Removing nearby alternate hosts of the fungus may help to reduce new infections in certain situations. Healthy Roses Pest Notes: Roses: Diseases and Abiotic Disorders",

    "description": "Rose flowers sometimes develop green, leaflike structures. This uncommon abnormality is called phyllody. Certain rose varieties (e.g., floribundas) more often develop phyllody. Identification Green, vegetativelike structures develop where rose flower parts such as pistils and stamens normally occur. When roses have both normal and abnormal flowers but foliage growth and color look healthy, the cause is probably abiotic, due to adverse environmental conditions. When mild weather returns, the subsequent flowers should develop normally if the cause of phyllody is abiotic. Phytoplasmas and viruses can also cause phyllody in many plant species, but not commonly in roses. If phyllody occurs on roses with stunted growth or foliage that is yellow or otherwise unhealthy, a phytoplasma or virus may be the cause. Life cycle Phyllody apparently is due to a plant hormone imbalance when flower buds are forming. In roses, usually hot weather or drought stress during flower bud formation are the cause of hormone imbalance. Infection by phytoplasmas or viruses can also disrupt plant hormones in roses and affect flower appearance. Because these pathogens typically alter foliage appearance, whether or not leaves appear healthy indicates whether the cause of phyllody is abiotic or pathogenic microorganisms.

    "description": "Several dozen species of native or introduced rust fungi attack conifers in California. Western gall rust and white pine blister rust are important canker and gall diseases, but most pine rusts are usually of minor importance. Identification Damage resembling that from needle rusts can be caused by sucking arthropods such as mites and scale insects. Abiotic factors, such as air pollution, drought or water deficit, herbicide damage, low temperatures, over-fertilization, and salt injury also kill needles or parts of them. Other causes of cankers and causes of galls include abiotic (nonliving e.g., environmental) factors and certain bacteria, insects, mistletoes, and other types of fungi. The host species and characteristics of the damage and fungal spores are used to identify rusts. Needle rusts. Coleosporium spp. and others cause brown, reddish, or yellow bands or spots on needles. Needles often turn brown or yellow and develop tiny, pale or dark spore-forming bodies, usually in winter or spring. Most Coleosporium spp. affect only the youngest needles and sporadically so during years when abundant rainfall coincides with new growth. Aster rust, Coleosporium asterum =C. solidaginis, is one of the most common pine needle rusts. It is found mostly on the foliage of lodgepole pine and its alternate hosts. Stalactiform rust. Peridermium stalactiforme causes rough bark (blisters) and cankers mostly on the lower branches and lower trunk of yellow (two- or three-needle) pines, including Jeffrey, lodgepole, and ponderosa pines. On the alternate hosts, stalactiform rust causes discolored blotches and orangish spores on leaves. Life cycle To complete their life cycles, most rusts must alternate between the pine and a host in a different plant family. An exception is western gall rust, which spreads from pine to pine. The aster rust alternate hosts are asters and goldenrods (Asteraceae). The alternate hosts of stalactiform rust are figworts (Scrophulariaceae), especially Indian paintbrush, Castilleja spp. Most rust fungi have four or five types of spores, which appear in a definite succession. The pycniospore and aeciospore are usually produced on the conifer needle. The urediospore (or uredospore), teliospore, and basidiospore are produced on the alternate hosts. The fruiting (spore-forming) structure of the fungus occurs below the cuticle or epidermis, or in blisters or fungal tissue covering the host tissue. The infective spores are windborne to the alternate host, where they germinate, penetrate the leaf tissue, and cause disease. Damage Needle rusts occur only sporadically in landscapes and forests. Damage to pines is usually negligible, except in nurseries and Christmas tree plantations. Most outbreaks involve a single season, and then years may pass with no new infections occurring. Stalactiform rust causes trunk cankers, which can kill trees by girdling. Tree death is uncommon except in seedlings or where two or more cankers coalesce. Infected branches are occasionally killed, but this usually has no significant affect on the growth of otherwise healthy trees. Solutions An interaction of host, pathogen, and environmental factors determines rust outbreaks. Although unsightly, most rusts usually do not seriously harm their hosts. Preventing pine rust damage is difficult or infeasible in many situations. See western gall rust and white pine blister rust for management of these important diseases.

    "description": "The fungus sporadically causes twig blight (dieback) in coast live oak, interior live oak, and valley oak. Trees with heavy infestations become unsightly and lose vigor.",
    "identification": "Various anthracnose and leaf spot fungi, including Apiognomonia errabunda (=Discula umbrinella) and Septoria quercicola, can cause similar damage. Unlike oak branch canker and dieback, anthracnose and leaf spot fungi and oak twig blight do not kill large branches or entire sections of the crown. Cryptocline cinerescens kills leaves and twigs from the current-season's growth. Infected shoots turn white or tan and die and remain on the tree, typically in scattered patches throughout the canopy. Cryptocline cinerescens appears to cause more damage on trees infested with oak pit scales.",
    "life_cycle": "Twig and foliar blight diseases tend to be more severe in years when frequent rains coincide with when new leaves are being produced. The fungi infect the current season's growth and cause the shoots to die. Symptoms are most noticeable in the summer and fall (July to October). Leaves on blighted shoots turn a straw-brown and typically remain attached to the shoot for several months. In some trees, only a few shoots are affected; in others, almost all shoots may be blighted. A general thinning of the crown is obvious in the year following infection.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Provide infected trees with adequate cultural care, especially appropriate watering. Unless they were raised with irrigation (e.g., planted oaks), avoid irrigating native oaks during the dry season; irrigate during the winter, if needed, when rainfall has been below normal. Avoid applying fertilizer, which can favor excessive shoot growth, leading to a denser, slower-drying canopy more susceptible to these diseases. Pruning may help to control the disease, but this may be feasible only for a few small or specimen trees with limited infections. Prune infected twigs during dry weather in the summer or early fall; make cuts properly in healthy tissue below infected twigs. Some systemic fungicides provide control if applied within 1 week after pruning. Fungicides alone are not as effective. Dead twigs and leaves remain on the tree, and the tree's appearance does not improve until these drop or are pruned out. Other pathogens and certain insects cause similar damage, so correctly determine the cause before attempting any control.",

    "description": "At least two Diplodia spp. fungi cause branch cankers and dieback on oaks in California. Hosts include California black oak, coast live oak, English oak, and valley oak.",
    "identification": "Trees affected by Diplodia have completely killed branches with all brown, dead leaves. This differs from the widely scattered twig dieback with small groups of brown leaves caused by oak anthracnose and twig blight fungi. There are many other common causes of cankers, including other species of canker fungi. Diplodia quercina kills small branches (usually those less than 1 inch, but up to 4 inches in diameter), causing leaves to turn brown, wilt, die, and remain attached in the canopy. Oak branch dieback outbreaks follow years of below-average rainfall. Diplodia corticola (named Botryosphaeria corticola during its sexual stage) causes crown thinning (leaves that are pale and smaller and less abundant than normal) and bark bleeding, cracking, and staining on the main trunk of coast live oak in southern California. Trunk symptoms of D. corticola infection (called bot canker) resemble damage caused by goldspotted oak borer. Disease caused by Diplodia spp. often can be distinguished by the masses of tiny, roundish, raised, black fruiting bodies (pycnidia) on bark of infected hosts. Peeling off bark around fruiting bodies and cankers reveals dark brown to black dead wood, commonly with a well-defined border between dark diseased and light-colored healthy wood.",
    "life_cycle": "The fungi may enter branches through wounds and possibly natural openings. Asexual fruiting bodies (pycnidia) are produced within 24 weeks and continue to produce spores for about two years. On branches with bark, pycnidia are in black masses of fungal tissue (stromata). Spore production and germination are favored by moisture.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Even drought-adapted oaks may require supplemental irrigation to reduce stress if rainfall has been well below normal. However, irrigation of native oaks should generally be done during the normal rainy season to supplement inadequate natural rainfall. Exceptions include planted oaks adapted to (raised with) summer irrigation from the start and in certain situations where soils have been disturbed. The specific amount and frequency of irrigation vary greatly, depending on factors such as environmental and soil conditions. Be aware that frequent irrigation during the dry season promotes Armillaria root disease (oak root fungus) and Phytophthora root and crown rot. Protect trees from other pests and injury and provide proper cultural care. No other specific management is known for D. corticola. For D. quercina, the disease is not a major problem in most years, and control is usually not needed.",

    "description": "Fungi that cause needle blight (dieback) and cast (premature drop) are weak pathogens. Even when environmental, plant, and fungal characteristics coincide to favor needle disease, usually only the foliage produced during a single season is damaged or drops prematurely, so trees rarely suffer severe stress or are killed.",
    "identification": "Most needle fungi infect only one or several related conifers and can be identified by their host and characteristic spore-forming structures on dying and dead needles. For example, Douglas-fir needle cast, Rhabdocline spp., affects only Douglas-fir, and mostly those in the North Coast. Cercospora needle blight, Cercospora sequoiae, affects coast redwood after warm, wet conditions. Elytroderma disease caused by Elytroderma deformans affects only pines, commonly those grown alongside lakes and streams. Unlike other needle cast fungi that develop in foliage, Elytroderma infection becomes systemic and persists in branch tissue, and it can seriously damage pines. All conifers are susceptible to brown felt blight, or \"snow mold.\" Needles buried under snow die in dark brown to gray masses matted together with fungal mycelium. Brown felt blight of pines is caused by Neopeckia (=Herpotrichia) coulteri. In other conifers, Herpotrichia juniperi (=H. nigra) causes brown felt blight.",
    "life_cycle": "These fungi often have life cycles that are timed with the growth and development of the host and may require 1, 2, or more years to complete. Sporulation, spread, and infection by these fungi are frequently restricted to a specific season, such as spring, summer, or fall. Successful infection depends on favorable conditions. For example, in some needle casts, infection is frequently restricted to the newly developing needles, and sporulation is timed to coincide in spring with needle development.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "To minimize needle blights, choose a planting site with good air circulation and avoid planting conifers too close together. Provide appropriate cultural care to encourage vigorous plant growth. When irrigating, use drip irrigation instead of overhead sprinkling and avoid irrigating in the late afternoon or evening. Generally, no other management is practical or necessary.",

Infected branches and twigs may die back and cankers (discolored, sunken, often elliptical areas) commonly develop in woody parts. Nectria spp. infection is often overlooked until clusters of the fungal fruiting bodies erupt from bark, usually during spring and summer. Each of these spherical orange or red sporodochia and perithecia (the coral spots) are about 1/50 to 1/16 inch in diameter and later turn pale or become covered with white spores. Where these fungal growths occur, cutting away bark reveals a margin separating dead (dark brown, necrotic) and healthy (cream-colored) wood. The green, living cambial layer found just beneath healthy bark is absent where cankers occur. There are many other common causes of cankers, including other species of canker fungi.",
    "life_cycle": "Nectria fungi infect woody species through weakened or wounded tissue, such as leaf scars and pruning wounds. Plants are especially susceptible to infection when unhealthy or stressed, such as from recent planting. Plants infected when young may die, but Nectria spp. rarely, if ever, kill older plants. Callous tissue developing around wounds often limits canker spread and prevents girdling of the trunk or limbs.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Proper cultural care and good growing conditions are the most important management methods. Plant only species well adapted to local conditions and especially provide appropriate irrigation. Avoid wounding or pruning plants, especially if they are growing poorly. Unless pruning must be seasonally timed to avoid other problems, prune if needed during early summer to reduce the likelihood of Nectria infections. No fungicides cure Nectria infections. If plants are heavily infected or susceptible species are newly planted, the frequency of new infections may be reduced by thoroughly spraying a fixed copper or a freshly prepared Bordeaux mixture during early leaf drop, just before the rainy weather. If leaf fall is prolonged by warm fall weather, a second application may be warranted when three-fourths of leaves have dropped.",

The Cucumber mosaic virus and Plantago asiatica mosaic virus (formerly Nandina mosaic virus) mostly cause a mottled red discoloration of heavenly bamboo leaves. Identification Leaf reddening in heavenly bamboo can also be due to other causes such as high light intensity. Cucumber mosaic virus infection causes wine red discoloration of new spring growth in nandina. Leaves may be thinner (more narrow in width) than normal and cupped downward. There may be fewer flower buds and berries on infected plants. Plantago asiatica mosaic virus causes a relatively mild mosaic; the reddening of foliage may not be very intense or extensive. There may be stunting and leaf distortion of infected Nandina. Life cycle Plantago asiatica mosaic virus spreads mechanically during propagation and pruning. The virus can be introduced into plants on cutting tools contaminated with sap from an infected plant. Cucumber mosaic virus, infects a variety of agricultural and ornamental plants and annual and perennial weeds. It can be transmitted mechanically. In the field, Cucumber mosaic virus is often spread by aphids, especially the melon aphid, Aphis gossypii, and green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. Aphids acquire the virus while feeding on infected plants and transmit it when they move and feed on other plants. Once a plant becomes infected with the virus, it usually remains infected throughout its life. Solutions There is no cure or treatment for virus-infected plants in landscapes. Replace affected plants if their performance is unsatisfactory. Purchase and plant only Nandina that has been virus-tested and found to be free of all known viruses.

    "identification": "The fungus infects only petals, causing white to brown spots that enlarge rapidly. Infected blossoms become droopy, limp, slimy, and sometimes cling to leaves after they die. Ovulinia petal blight resembles Botrytis blight. However, Botrytis blight is a drier rot that also affects dying or inactive green tissue, while Ovulinia petal blight infects only blossoms. Botrytis and Ovulinia produce similar sclerotia (infectious structures) that are black, flattened, irregular shaped, and up to about 1/2 inch long. Sclerotia from fallen flowers produce very small, brownish, mushroomlike or wineglass-shaped apothecia (reproductive, spore-forming structures) about 1/10 inch diameter on stalks up to about 2/5 inch long.",
    "life_cycle": "The Ovulinia fungus infects wet blossoms when temperatures are mild, about 50° to 70°F. Black sclerotia develop at the base of infected flowers, then drop to the soil where they persist and produce apothecia for several years. Ovulinia petal blight also produces colorless conidia (asexual spores) on infected petals. These spores spread in wind and by the movement of flower-visiting insects, especially bumble bees. This allows the fungus to reproduce and spread between many blossoms within several days of an initial infection.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Sanitation is the primary management method. Remove and dispose of fallen, old, and infected flowers. Gently twist the flower stem and discard it in a covered trash container. Do not add azalea or rhododendron petals or leaves to mulch that will be used around those plants, even if it has been composted. It is difficult to expose plant debris to the temperature required to kill all of the Ovulinia propagules by composting. Avoid overhead irrigation and provide good air circulation. Each year, when blossoms are no longer present, apply a fresh layer of uncontaminated organic mulch beneath host plants and maintain about a 4-inch mulch layer to help suppress Ovulinia propagules. Keep mulch thin near the trunk or several inches away from the trunk. Application of an appropriate fungicide, such as triforine, prior to budbreak or prior to rainy weather can help to reduce infections. Fungicides often provide only partial control unless they are used in combination with the recommended sanitation and cultural practices.",

Cutting off bark reveals blackish to brown streaks in infected wood. Discoloration appears as dark, concentric rings when infected branches are cut in cross-section. Do not confuse DED symptoms with the chewing damage of elm leaf beetle, which also causes leaf browning; viewed from some distance the damage looks superficially similar. Elm leaf beetle chews holes through leaves and skeletonizes leaf surfaces, which can be distinguished by inspecting foliage or dropped leaves close-up.",
    "life_cycle": "Dutch elm disease is spread by elm bark beetles, Scolytus spp. Bark beetle adults emerge from dead or dying trees or from elm logs infected with the fungus and carry spores that infect healthy elms when the adults feed in the crotch of young twigs. People inadvertently spread this pathogen by moving elms or elm logs infested with beetles or fungi to disease-free areas. Tools used to cut, inject, or prune infected elms spread the fungi to other elms. The fungi also spread from infected elms through natural root grafts to nearby elms.",
    "damage": "Dutch elm disease has killed several thousand elms in California, mostly in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Sacramento. Millions of elms have been killed in midwestern and eastern states since 1930.",
    "solutions": "American and European elms are highly susceptible to the disease, which originally is from Asia. Plant elms that are resistant to Dutch elm disease and elm leaf beetle. Some of these trees also resist phloem necrosis (elm yellows), a phytoplasma not yet reported in California. Alternatively, plant hackberry (Celtis spp.), hornbeam (Carpinus spp.), or other species that resemble elms but are not attacked by elm pests. Most elm species and hybrids are adapted to summer rainfall. Maintain tree vigor by providing adequate summer irrigation in areas with summer drought. Report suspected Dutch elm disease to the county agricultural commissioner. Remove infected elms immediately to eliminate them as a source of the fungi, which otherwise will spread to nearby elms. Digging a trench around infected trees deep enough to cut the roots may prevent the fungi from spreading by natural root grafts to nearby elms. Pruning. Promptly prune off and dispose of dead and dying elm limbs as they commonly are infested with the fungus-spreading elm bark beetles and can pose a limb-drop (failure) hazard. Promptly pruning off recently diseased limbs may be a management method in areas where quarantine regulations do not require the removal of the entire tree. This \"therapeutic pruning\" can be effective only if done promptly during the first season when disease symptoms appear on a tree. For therapeutic pruning to potentially be effective, the trees must be otherwise healthy and vigorous. Symptoms must be limited to one or a few limbs, and at least 10 feet of healthy wood, free of visible disease streaking, must separate the infected wood from the pruning point on the main trunk. Be aware that unless tools are thoroughly cleaned and sterilized after contacting infected tissue, DED and other vascular wilt pathogens can be mechanically spread by unsterilized tools that contact internal parts of trees, such as tools used to prune trees or inject them with chemicals. Avoid unnecessary pruning. Properly prune elms when needed, especially when trees are young and preferably during late fall and winter. Bury, chip, or (where permitted) burn freshly cut elm wood. Alternatively, seal elm logs tightly under clear plastic in a sunny location through the warm season and for at least 7 months, after which they are no longer suitable for beetle breeding. Fungicides. No fungicides have been demonstrated to be effective against Dutch elm disease in California. Based on use in the eastern United States, injection of certain systemic fungicides by a competent, professional applicator may prevent DED and help some recently infected trees to survive if properly treated while less than 5 to 10% of their canopy is symptomatic. Consider fungicide treatment only if Dutch elm disease has been discovered infecting nearby elms. Do not use fungicide alone; it has limited effectiveness, and only when combined with proper pruning and tree care. If the main trunk or many limbs show symptoms, promptly remove the dying tree to reduce pathogen spread to nearby elms. The prompt detection and removal of dead and dying elms is the most effective method for managing the disease. See Dutch elm disease by the American Phytopathological Society and the U.S. Forest Service DED website for more information.",

    "description": "Clear, brownish, or frothy viscous liquid sometimes drips from acorns of coast live oak and interior live oak. Dripping acorns have been an intermittent problem from spring through fall in coastal areas and interior valleys of California, causing a sticky mess on surfaces beneath affected oaks. Drippy acorn, also called drippy nut, is caused by Brenneria (=Erwinia) quercina, a bacterium that infects wounds in oak tissue. Bacteria commonly enter acorns injured by filbert weevils or filbertworms and certain other insects. The B. quercina bacterium causes ooze from nuts and the acorn cap, including caps that remain attached after the nut has dropped. Identification In addition to dripping from older acorns and caps, profuse dripping or frothy exudate sometimes occurs from very young or barely developed acorns, from distortions where young acorns would be expected to occur, and from leaves or twigs where there are no acorns. This dripping has been attributed to oviposition wounds from several species of oak gall wasps that allow infection by B. quercina bacteria. However, neither B. quercina or insects or their damage have been definitely associated with some situations where the cause of oak dripping is unknown. Dripping from oak canopies can also be caused by nectar-producing oak galls of certain cynipid wasps, including Andricus, Disholcaspis, and Dryocosmus species. Aphids, oak leaf phylloxera, scale insects, whiteflies, woolly aphids, and other honeydew-excreting insects can also cause sticky liquid to drip from oaks. Damage Liquid dripping from trees and onto surfaces beneath can be annoying and unpleasant. However, the malady apparently does not threaten tree health. Solutions No methods have been demonstrated to be effective in controlling bacterial-associated dripping from oaks. Fortunately, the malady is sporadic and does not occur every year. Where dripping is a problem, wash fouled surfaces regularly while dripping is relatively recent and easier to remove. Pruning branches to reduce canopy overhang in sensitive areas (e.g., driveways, patios) can reduce potential dripping. However, extensive pruning or removing large limbs wounds trees and allows entry of decay organisms that can weaken trees and contribute to their premature death. Pruning may not be an appropriate response to this temporary, aesthetic problem. For more information see A Field Guide to Insects and Diseases of California Oaks.

    "description": "Downy mildews, including Peronospora and Plasmopara spp., are pathogenic water molds (oomycetes) that primarily damage foliage. Hosts include caneberries, rose, various herbaceous ornamentals, and many fruit, grain, and vegetable crops. Identification Downy mildew causes pale green to yellow areas on the upper surface of leaves, and sometimes also discolors buds and stems. Discoloration may turn purplish red to dark brown and necrotic; its shape often depends on leaf veins, which limit the pathogen's spread. Infected leaves may drop prematurely. Where downy mildew lesions occur on the upper surface of leaves, fluffy masses of brown, gray, or purplish spores form on the underside of leaves. Because under ideal, cool moist conditions spores persist for only a few days, often no spores are visible even though downy mildew is causing damage. Downy mildew can be confused with powdery mildew, such as on roses. However, grayish downy mildew spores are almost always limited to the underside of leaves, and viewed under magnification its spores occur in branched stalks (sporangia) like tiny trees. Powdery mildew is common on both sides of the leaf and produces spores on chains, and its whitish to gray growth is typically more extensive and prominent than with downy mildew. Powdery mildews are fungi and downy mildews are oomycetes (not fungi), which partly explains why their biology and management differ. Life cycle Downy mildew spores are produced only on living plants and spread mostly with air movement. Spores landing on a host germinate and infect within 8 to 12 hours if the plant is wet. Downy mildews are favored by low temperatures (40° to 70°F) and require high relative humidity (≥90%) or wet foliage to produce spores and infect plants. Solutions To control downy mildew, provide good air circulation and maintain low humidity; adequately space plants and prune host canopies and nearby and overhead vegetation. Avoid wetting foliage; use drip or low-volume microsprinklers instead of overhead irrigation where feasible. Promptly remove and dispose of infected foliage to reduce pathogen inoculum. Control with pesticides (mostly preventive fungicides) is difficult, and modifying environmental conditions can be more effective.",

    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Drought stress and other disorders or pest damage dramatically increase most hosts' susceptibility to Cytospora canker.

Avoid planting susceptible cypress in warm areas. Grow species that are resistant or not susceptible. Poplar hybrids that show some resistance to Cytospora include Easter, Mighty Mo, Nor, and Platte. If cankers are limited to one or a few limbs, during the growing season, remove (cut out) cankers and destroy dead or damaged wood. Pruning during the growing season allows you to better identify branches with cankers. To ensure that all the disease is removed, cut several inches to one foot below any canker symptoms into healthy wood.

Agrobacterium tumefaciens usually does not seriously harm woody plants unless galls occur in the root crown when plants are young. Infected young plants may become stunted and subject to wind breakage and drought stress. If galls are large, water or nutrient transport can be inhibited to the extent that young plants are killed. Crown gall appears to have a relatively minor effect on most older plants.",
    "identification": "Another bacterium, possibly Agrobacterium pseudotsugae, causes galls on stems of Douglas-fir. Crown galls on bark surfaces resemble damage from certain boring insects, woolly aphids, or other causes of plant galls. Certain boring insects colonize galled tissue, complicating diagnosis of the original cause. Agrobacterium tumefaciens causes galling principally on the basal stem and root crown, at the soil line or just below the surface. Galls sometimes also develop on limbs, trunks, and roots. The surface of crown galls and wood underneath is the same color as healthy bark and wood. However, when cut with a knife, crown galls are softer than normal wood and lack the typical pattern of annual growth rings. Galls can be tiny and smooth on young plants but usually are rough and sometimes massive on older trees.",
    "life_cycle": "The bacteria reproduce in galled tissue and may slough off and survive in soil for long periods. Bacteria in soil enter plants through wounds, commonly caused during handling in the nursery or when transplanting. The bacteria can also infect newly emerging roots, growth cracks, and wounds caused by sucker removal or string trimmers or other equipment.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "Where crown gall has been a problem, plant resistant species, including birch, cedar, coast redwood, holly, incense cedar, magnolia, pine, spruce, tulip tree, and zelkova. Purchase and plant only high-quality nursery stock and avoid injuring trees, especially around the soil line. Dipping seeds or roots in the nursery in a solution of the biological control agents K-84 or K-1026 [nonpathogenic strains of A. tumefaciens (=A. radiobacter)] may reduce infections by most strains of pathogenic crown gall bacteria but not the strain commonly affecting grape. Solarization, covering moist, bare soil with clear plastic for 4 to 6 weeks during the sunny, dry season before planting may reduce crown gall bacteria in the upper soil. Galls can be removed by cutting into healthy wood around galls and exposing the tissue to drying. Cut out galls only during the dry season and minimize the removal of healthy tissue. At least on certain fruit and nut trees, gall regrowth is frequently avoided by using a blowtorch to briefly heat and sterilize the edges where galls were removed. Do not burn or char tissue and use caution to avoid fire or injury. If galls encompass much of the crown area, cutting them out causes other problems or tree death. Replace extensively galled trees if their growth is unsatisfactory.",

    "description": "Anthracnose is a group of diseases resulting from infection by various fungi. Often called bud, leaf, shoot, or twig blight, damage is most severe when prolonged spring rains occur during or shortly after new plant growth develops. Identification Anthracnose symptoms vary with the host's growth stage and species, weather, and time of year. Small black, brown, or tan spots appear on infected leaves of some hosts, including elm and oak. Dead leaf areas may be more irregular on hosts such as ash. Chinese elm anthracnose, Stegophora ulmea, also called black leaf spot, is a serious disease in coastal areas of California. Fungal infection causes foliage to develop irregular, black, tarlike spots and leaves drop prematurely. Chinese elm anthracnose produces especially large cankers that can weaken, girdle, or kill limbs and trunks. Dogwood anthracnose, Discula destructiva, causes leaves and flower bracts to develop large brownish lesions with well-defined, dark, discolored margins that may be grayish or purple. Infected leaves may drop prematurely or dead gray leaves may remain on twigs in the canopy overwinter. Dogwood anthracnose can severely canker branches, especially in the lower canopy, causing branch dieback and sometimes death of the entire tree. Sycamore anthracnose, Apiognomonia veneta =Discula platani, kills sycamore shoots and leaves. Anthracnose lesions commonly develop first around the major leaf veins, but scattered shoot terminals and entire leaves and groups of leaves are often killed. Life cycle Anthracnose fungi overwinter primarily in cankers and lesions in infected twigs. On evergreen species such as Chinese elm and live oaks, the fungi can occur year-round on leaves as well as woody parts. Spores are produced when infected tissue is wet. Spores spread by splashing and windborne rain to infect new twigs and foliage. Spore production and infection continue as long as new growth and wet conditions occur together. Once foliage matures and weather becomes warm and dry, disease development slows or stops. Damage Anthracnose does not seriously harm most hosts. Exceptions are when defoliation occurs repeatedly, and certain species at some locations where branch dieback and cankering are extensive. Anthracnose fungi discolor leaves or kill portions of leaves, entire leaves, small groups of leaves, and twigs scattered throughout the canopy. Small branches can be cankered, girdled, and killed on more susceptible hosts, including some species of ash, dogwood, elm, oak, and sycamore. The resulting regrowth from lateral buds can give trees a gnarled or crooked appearance. Solutions Where prolonged spring rains or foggy conditions are common, avoid planting especially susceptible species. For example, the Bloodgood, Columbia, and Liberty cultivars of London plane are less susceptible or resistant to sycamore anthracnose, but Yarwood is commonly damaged. Prune and dispose of infected twigs during the fall or winter where practical on small trees so overwintering infections are pruned off. Rake up and dispose of fallen leaves and do not mulch around hosts using fresh or uncomposted leaves or flowers from plants susceptible to that same anthracnose. Increase sunlight and air circulation (for example, by pruning nearby plants to reduce shade and spacing new plants far enough apart). Pest Notes: Anthracnose",

    "description": "Cherry buckskin disease is most often spread by two species of leafhoppers, the cherry leafhopper, Fieberiella florii, and the mountain leafhopper, Colladonus montanus. The cherry leafhopper is an efficient vector of cherry buckskin and appears to be responsible for severe outbreaks of the disease. The leafhopper overwinters as nymphs on ornamental hosts such as privet, boxwood, pyracantha, etc. and as eggs on ornamental hosts and deciduous fruit trees. There are three periods of adult activity: mid-April through May, during July, and September through October. The mountain leafhopper is a slender, active leafhopper with a yellow band behind the head and a yellow spot in the center of each wing. The leafhopper overwinters in weedy fields and prefers weeds on the orchard floor. It does not prefer cherry but can infect healthy trees by feeding on infected weeds such as clover.",

    "description": "Sawflies (Tenthredinidae) are wasps (Hymenoptera) named for the females' jagged (sawtoothed), egg-laying organ. The California pear sawfly is an occasional pest of pears.",
    "identification": "Adults are stout wasps about 1/4 inch long with two pairs of wings with distinct veins. They have a black body with yellow on the legs and prothorax, the area immediately behind the head. Adults have a broad waist, unlike most wasps that have a narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax. Larvae of California pear sawfly are bright green and up to 1/2 inch long. The head is light brown with a small, black, eye spot on each side. In addition to three pairs of true legs behind the head, the larvae have pairs of prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two to seven (six pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage have five or fewer pairs of prolegs. The green body of California pear sawfly can be hard to spot on leaves, especially because larvae commonly feed with their body aligned along the inside edge of holes they are chewing. When California pear sawfly feeds along leaf margins, the damage can resemble the half-moon-shaped cuts of leafcutting bees, which are beneficial pollinators. Note that the pear sawfly (cherryslug, or pearslug) is a different, more-damaging species. Unlike California pear sawfly, larvae of the pear sawfly excrete an olive-green coating that gives the appearance of a slug (shell-less mollusk).",
    "life_cycle": "Sawflies develop through four life stages: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. The California pear sawfly overwinters as a mature, inactive larva (prepupa) in a silk cocoon in litter on the ground and in topsoil. Pupation and adult emergence occur in early spring. After mating, females insert tiny, translucent to white eggs singly into leaf tissue, commonly in the margins of leaves in the lower part of the tree. Most eggs hatch by petal fall and the larvae immediately begin feeding as they develop through several increasingly larger instars (immature stages). Larvae mature about May, then drop to the ground to overwinter. There is one generation per year.",
    "damage": "Larvae of California pear sawfly and their feeding damage occur only during spring. The larvae chew circular holes in leaves. When larvae are abundant, entire leaves can be consumed except for the midrib. Otherwise-healthy trees can tolerate a significant amount of leaf chewing without threatening tree health.",
    "solutions": "Birds, predatory wasps, and other natural enemies feed on this sporadic pest. Natural enemies sometimes cause a dramatic decline in the abundance of sawfly larvae over a relatively short period of time. California pear sawfly is not commonly abundant in California and the larvae do not feed on fruit. Generally no control is recommended. For more damaging species, see Pear Sawfly (Cherryslug, Pearslug) and Sawflies.

    "description": "Larvae (caterpillars) of tussock moths (Lymantriidae) feed at least occasionally on most any species of deciduous and evergreen trees.",
    "identification": "Adults are hairy and brown, gray, or white moths. Males have a wingspan of about 1-1/2 inches. Females of some species appear to be wingless. The tiny, whitish eggs occur in a mass of several hundred, covered with the female's brownish hairs. A tussock moth egg mass closely resembles the hair-covered pupal case. Pupae occur on or near the host plant. Young larvae are hairy and black. Full-grown caterpillars have prominent hairs that protrude, some in dense tufts, from colored tubercles along their body. Western tussock moth, Orgyia vetusta, hosts include fruit and nut trees, hawthorn, manzanita, oak, pyracantha, toyon, walnut, and willow. Mature caterpillars are gray and have numerous bright blue, red, and yellow spots from which gray to white hairs radiate. They have four dense white tufts of hair on the back, two black tufts on the head, and a black and a white tuft at the rear. Rusty tussock moth, O. antiqua, feeds on many different deciduous and evergreen plants. The adult male is a black, brownish, and gray moth with a whitish blotch and brown band on each forewing. The larvae have a black body with numerous gray to tan hairs. There are three projecting tufts of black hair, two in front and one at the rear, and four orangish to straw-colored tufts along the back. The Douglas-fir tussock moth, O. pseudotsugata, feeds primarily on Douglas-fir and true firs. Lighter-colored tufts of hair along the back, red spots on top, and an orange stripe along each side distinguish its mature larvae from those of the rusty tussock moth.",
    "life_cycle": "Tussock moths overwinter as eggs. The tiny, dark caterpillars hatch in spring and can use a silk strand and their body hairs to float on the wind to other trees. After feeding, mature larvae pupate on bark in a hairy, brown or tan cocoon. The emerging females produce pheromone to attract the night-flying males; females of some species are flightless. Adults occur from late spring through at least early summer. There are one or two generations per year, depending on the species and location. In southern California, western tussock moth may have two generations, with second-generation larvae present from about late August to October.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew foliage, giving plants a clipped or ragged appearance. Localized high numbers of larvae can completely defoliate trees. Otherwise healthy broadleaf plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Larvae may also take small bites out of young fruit, causing the damaged areas to later discolor or become scabby as fruit grow. Young larvae that migrate by floating on wind can be annoying when abundant. The larval hairs readily detach when touched, and can irritate human skin. The urticating setae, or hollow hairs, connect to poison sacs under the larval skin. Tussock moths generally do not warrant insecticide application unless plants are otherwise unhealthy or young. An exception is heavily infested conifers, which can be killed by a single defoliation.",
    "solutions": "Various predatory beetles and bugs and para­sitic tachinid flies and wasps often help keep tussock moth populations at low levels. For example, a tiny, purplish-black scelionid wasp, Telenomus californicus, kills many western tussock moth eggs. A caterpillar-specific nucleopolyhedrosis virus can quickly reduce tussock moth populations, though often not until after trees have been extensively defoliated. When killed by the virus, larvae often hang limply from twigs. Removing egg masses, newly hatched caterpillars, and cocoons may provide some control on shrubs and small trees. Wear chemical-resistant gloves and clothing that well-covers skin. Definitely avoid inhaling any caterpillar parts. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) controls tussock moth larvae, especially if applied when most larvae are young. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. The somewhat-selective spinosad is also effective, but can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering.

    "description": "Larvae of the spotted wing drosophila (SWD, Drosophilidae) feed in cherries throughout the state and in blueberries and occasionally caneberries and strawberries mostly in coastal areas. Identification The legless, whitish larvae at maturity, and the cylindrical, brown to yellow pupae, are about 1/8 inch long. Adults are flies about 1/10 inch long with red eyes and a brown thorax. The female's egg laying creates a small puncture in a depression on the fruit surface. Male D. suzukii can be distinguished from most other Drosophila spp. by the dark spot near the tip of each of their two wings. Other similar-looking Drosophila spp. vinegar flies, or common fruit flies, mostly feed in fermenting, injured, or overripe fruit. Larvae of true fruit flies (Tephritidae) also feed in the pulp of fruits and certain other crops. Pest tephritid flies in California include apple maggot (Rhagoletis pomonella), olive fruit fly (Bactrocera oleae), and walnut husk fly (Rhagoletis completa). Adult tephritids and mature larvae (pale maggots) are about 1/4 inch long, considerably larger than the spotted wing drosophila and other vinegar flies. Exotic tephritids such as the Mediterranean, Mexican, and Oriental fruit flies are periodically introduced and have apparently been eradicated. Take any tephritid flies or maggots you find in fruit to the county agricultural commissioner or your local UC ANR Cooperative Extension office for identification unless you are confident the species found is already known to be established in California. Life cycle Spotted wing drosophila adult females lay eggs in fruit just as it begins to develop its mature color. One to several larvae feed in each fruit, causing it to soften and become decayed. After maturing, the larvae partially or completely exit the fruit to pupate. There may be up to 10 generations per year. Damage Spotted wing drosophila attacks healthy ripening fruit and damaged or split fruit. The female's ovipositor creates a small puncture in a depression on the fruit surface. Maggots feeding inside the fruit cause the flesh to turn brown and soft. Fruit may decay from secondary fungal and bacterial pathogens and drop. Solutions Traps help detect the presence of spotted wing drosophila. If trapping identifies that SWD is present, or you had this problem last year, insecticide can be applied. Removing and destroying infested fruit and fruit on the ground may help to reduce infestation of later-maturing varieties. Fine netting ≤0.98 mm mesh (e.g., made for no-seeums) placed over hosts before fruit begins to color or ripen may help to reduce infestation if it is well secured to exclude the flies. Spotted wing drosophila can be controlled by applications of spinosad, if the sprays are well timed. Monitor fruit and make the first application when fruit begin to change to their mature color. Because some varieties ripen early, others late, and more than one variety may be grown together, the total number of applications depends on what varieties are grown and temperature. In cherries, make the first application as fruit turns from yellowish to pink (about 2 to 3 weeks before harvest). Spray each variety at least a second time 7 to 10 days later, the shorter interval if temperatures have been warm and longer when it's been cool. In blueberries, apply an insecticide when the first berries begin to turn from green to pink. Make a second application prior to harvest. Treatments may be warranted at 7- to 14-day intervals until harvest is over. Pest Notes: Spotted Wing Drosophila",

Isopods have a hard, shell-like covering that is made up of a series of segmented plates. Some isopods roll up into a ball when disturbed and are called pillbugs. Isopods have seven pairs of legs and are dark gray or brown but may be almost purple or blue just after molting.",

Predatory mites have longer legs and are more active than are the plant-feeding mites. They move much faster and lack the dark spots of spider mites. You can purchase and release predatory mites to establish populations, but the best results are obtained by creating favorable conditions for naturally occurring predators--for instance, by avoiding dusty conditions and pesticide sprays. Predator mites do not feed on foliage or become pests, so must be released when pest mites are available. To establish predators in a heavily infested orchard or garden that has few predators, use a soap spray to bring pests to a lower level and then release predators. A good rule of thumb is that one predator is needed for every ten spider mites to provide control. Concentrate releases where spider mite numbers are highest. Once established on perennials, predatory mites may reproduce and provide biological control indefinitely without further augmentation unless nonselective insecticides are applied.",

    "description": "Pear sawfly (Tenthredinidae) is a wasp (Hymenoptera) named for the females' jagged (sawtoothed), egg-laying organ. The larvae chew foliage of cherry, pear, and occasionally other Rosaceae.",
    "identification": "Adult pear sawflies are about 1/5 inch long and glossy black overall with yellow. They have two pairs of wings with prominent veins and a broad waist, unlike the narrow constriction between the abdomen and thorax of most wasps. Larvae are whitish to yellow with a yellowish-brown head when they are newly hatched, recently molted, or mature (prepupae). After molting as they begin to feed, larvae exude a gelatinous, olive-green coating that obscures the body surface and gives them the appearance of a slug (shell-less mollusk). Larvae grow to about 3/8 inch long. The thorax, three segments immediately behind the head, is wider than the rest of the body. The California pear sawfly, Pristiphora abbreviata, also feeds on pear; its larvae are bright green and lack an olive-green coating. In addition to three pairs of true legs behind the head (obscured by the body coating), pear sawfly larvae have prolegs (fleshy stubs, or leglike appendages) on abdominal segments two to eight (seven pairs) and a clasperlike rear end. Most other caterpillarlike larvae that occur openly on foliage have five or fewer pairs of prolegs.",
    "life_cycle": "Pear sawflies overwinter as inactive, mature larvae (prepupae) in cells they form in topsoil. In early spring, they pupate and emerge as adults and mate. Females insert tiny eggs in the underside of host leaves. Larvae soon hatch and feed and develop through five, increasingly larger instars (growth stages). At maturity, they drop to the ground, move into topsoil, and form a pupation cell. There generally are two generations per year in California. Larvae are most abundant in mid to late spring and mid to late summer. Feeding by the second-generation larvae during summer causes most of the foliage damage.",
    "damage": "Larvae chew and skeletonize cherry and pear foliage and also feed on cotoneaster, hawthorn, mountain ash, plum, and quince. They feed on the upper side of leaves, chewing surface tissue except for the veins and causing brownish to gray patches in foliage. Pear sawfly and its damage in California occur mostly in coastal and northern areas. Feeding by high numbers of larvae may reduce fruit size that season and result in fewer or smaller fruit or both the following season. Pear sawfly feeding does not seriously threaten the survival of otherwise-healthy plants.",
    "solutions": "Pear sawfly is often controlled by natural enemies. When limited in numbers, pick the pearslugs (cherryslugs) off by hand or dislodge them from foliage with a forceful stream of water. Larvae are relatively easy to control if thoroughly sprayed with almost any insecticide, including horticultural or narrow-range oil, neem oil, insecticidal soap, and spinosad. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) does not control sawfly larvae because they are not caterpillars, which are the larvae of butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). Avoid applying broad-spectrum, persistent insecticides, such as carbamates (carbaryl, or Sevin), organophosphates (e.g., malathion), and pyrethroids (e.g., bifenthrin, cyfluthrin, fluvalinate, and permethrin); these are harmful to bees and natural enemies and some products move to contaminate surface water and adversely affect aquatic organisms.

    "description": "Feeding by this rust mite (family Eriophyidae) causes brownish discoloration on pear fruit and leaves. On apple, only leaves are fed on and discolored. Identification Adults and nymphs of pear rust mites are wedge shaped with the head and two pairs of legs at the wider end. These tiny mites are 1/120 inch or less in length so you need at least a 20X hand lens to see them. They are more easily seen using a binocular microscope with good lighting. The tiny eggs are spherical, nearly clear when first laid, and become pale-straw colored before hatching. These mites are often not noticed until their feeding damage appears and the cause is investigated. When overwintering on bark and buds, the mites are brown to reddish. During the growing season when they feed, they are cream-colored to whitish. Darkened foliage can also be caused by the feeding of spider mites. In comparison with rust mites, spider mites are rounder and larger. Spider mites commonly have two dark spots and often produce webbing. Rust mites leave no webbing on plants. Life cycle Eriophyid mites develop through three life stages: egg, nymph, and adult. The mite overwinters as adult females beneath bud scales and on young bark, predominantly on branches 2 to 4 years old. As buds open in spring, the mites become active and adult females soon begin laying eggs. After hatching, immature mites grow rapidly through two instars. In apples the mites feed primarily on the surface of leaves. In pears they move to developing leaf clusters and feed within buds. As pear leaves mature and harden, pear rust mites move either to young succulent leaf tissue or to fruit. Soon after petal fall, aesthetically damaging populations may develop around the calyx or stem end or both of pear fruit. The russeting on the fruit becomes visible around late May or June, when pears have increased in size and turned down. By late summer, only females are present, and they seek overwintering sites under scales of newly developed pear tissues. If tender foliage remains present, the females may remain active and feeding on leaves into November. Several generations occur each growing season. Damage Pear rust mites feed on the surface of apple and pear foliage and on pear fruit, causing a browning of the tissue. Injury to leaves if abundant may stunt the growth of young trees. If these mites are abundant and uncontrolled, the feeding and russeting may spread over the entire fruit, marring fruit appearance. Internal fruit quality is not affected. The intensity of russeting is determined by the number of mites and the length of their feeding period. Pear rust mite is commonly not detected until tissues grow and expand, which is after the feeding damage has occurred. Solutions In backyard fruit trees natural enemies can keep pear rust mites under fairly good control. To conserve predators of mites, avoid the application of residual (persistent), broad-spectrum insecticides and miticides for all pests, including carbamates (carbaryl), organophosphates (e.g., malathion) and pyrethroids (\"-thrin\" insecticides e.g., bifenthrin, permethrin). Control ants and reduce dustiness, such as by hosing off foliage of small trees. See Protecting Natural Enemies and Pollinators for more information. Aesthetic damage to fruit surfaces generally does not justify treatment in backyard trees. If treatment is desired, best control is achieved with a fall application of micronized sulfur, or during the dormant season (after November 1) sulfur plus horticultural or narrow-range oil. To avoid plant damage, do not spray oil on trees that were drought-stressed during late summer or fall. An Illustrated Guide to Plant Abnormalities Caused by Eriophyid Mites in North America",

The actual level of parasitization is highest, however, when leafminer populations are low. Female parasites usually lay their eggs in the leaf mine formed at the beginning of the tissue-feeding stage. After hatching, parasitic larvae generally attach themselves to the outside of fourth- or fifth-instar leafminers. The parasite grows rapidly and consumes the leafminer by its fifth instar. It then pupates within the leaf mine, at about the same time as the leafminer would have. Although smaller than a leafminer pupa, the parasite pupa can be distinguished by its larger head and eyes and flattened body. Following pupation, the adult parasite cuts a hole in the leaf and emerges. Adult parasites are small but easy to spot when populations are abundant because they fly in groups that hover near infested trees. Adult parasites feed on the sap-feeding leafminers.",

    "life_cycle": "Peak adult weevil populations occur in summer and early fall, and some may overwinter. Female weevils may feed for an extended period before laying eggs, and many species produce viable eggs without mating. Eggs are laid in soil near the base of plants about 4 to 6 weeks after adults have emerged. A single female may lay as many as 500 eggs. Eggs hatch into legless, white grubs that feed on roots. The larvae develop in soil through 6 instars over a period of 2 to 8 months. They are whitish grubs with a brown head and commonly have a C-shaped posture. Black vine weevil overwinters primarily as a late-instar larva. A few individuals of this and other species can overwinter as adults. Weevils overwintering as late instars form pupae in spring. Adult weevils emerge in late spring or summer and feed on the foliage of host plants at night. Adults do not fly, but may crawl into new plantings from nearby native plants, ornamentals, blackberries, or second-year strawberries",
    "damage": "Adults generally feed on foliage. Leaves appear notched or ragged and may be clipped from twigs. The most serious damage is done by larvae, which feed on roots and can destroy root hairs and chew the bark and cortex off larger roots. Some may tunnel into the crown and destroy crown tissue. In herbaceous plants, damage is usually first seen as wilting and dying plants in a localized area of the garden.",
    "solutions": "Destroy adults to prevent more serious damage. Grow species or cultivars that are less susceptible to weevil damage, and avoid replanting susceptible crops at infested sites. Grow older plants that are more likely to be infested away from younger plants susceptible to weevils. Provide cultural care to keep plants vigorous and better able to tolerate damage. Check roots before planting to make sure they are free from larvae. On trees, trim branches that provide a bridge to other plants or the ground and apply a 6-inch band of sticky material to trunks to prevent flightless beetles from feeding on foliage. On strawberries, destroy all affected plants, then move outward in a circular pattern, removing plants (even if they are healthy looking) that are infested with larvae and pupae until you no longer find weevils. Replant if necessary after working the soil well and solarizing or treating with commercially available parasitic nematodes when larvae or pupae are expected to be present (in midsummer to fall). Soil must be warm and moist. Trapping adults may help or you can apply a barrier around the bed made of tarpaper and coated with Stickem or Tanglefoot about 18 inches high and buried 2 to 3 inches into the soil to keep adults out. No effective insecticides are available for larvae.",

    "url": "http://ipm.ucanr.edu/PMG/GARDEN/FRUIT/PESTS/omnilooper.html?src=exchbt",
    "description": "The looper, or measuringworm (Geometridae), larvae chew leaves, shoots, and occasionally fruit and feed on several dozen plant species. Hosts include acacia, box elder, California buckeye, chestnut, elm, eucalyptus, fruit trees, ginkgo, magnolia, maple, pepper tree, and willow. Identification Young omnivorous looper larvae are pale yellow caterpillars. Older larvae grow to about 2 inches long and are yellow to pale green or pink, with dark brown, black, or green lines along the sides and a gold-colored head. In addition to the three pairs of legs behind the head, omnivorous loopers have two pairs of prolegs (leglike appendages) near the rear on abdominal segments 6 and 10. This allows them to travel in the characteristic looping manner, pulling their rear forward as they arch up their back. Mature larvae form pearly white to brown pupae, usually in webbing between leaves. Adults are tan moths with a narrow, black band across the middle of the wing. The barrel-shaped, pale green to reddish brown eggs have a ring of tiny projections and occur in clusters on the underside of leaves. Life cycle Larvae hatch from the eggs about 8 or 9 days after oviposition, leaving behind transparent shells. Mature larvae usually pupate in webbing between leaves. Pupation lasts 1 to 4 weeks. Adults (moths) are active at night. Populations increase with increasing temperatures in spring. Depending on temperature, egg-to-adult development takes 2 to 5 months. Omnivorous looper has four to five generations per year in warmer, inland locations and three generations per year in coastal areas. Damage Omnivorous looper leaf damage is especially evident on terminal shoots. Young larvae chew the leaf surface, leaving a brown membrane. Older larvae chew entirely through edges of leaves or shoots or between leaves tied with silk, often leaving only the midrib and larger veins. Fruit damage can be caused by young or old larvae. If young fruit is fed on, it sometimes becomes misshapen. Chewing typically scars the fruit surface and may cause damaged fruit to drop. Solutions Conserve natural enemies that can biologically control omnivorous looper. Avoid applying broad-spectrum, residual (persistent) insecticides to plants. Omnivorous loopers thrive in more protected sites, so pruning and thinning canopies can substantially reduce caterpillar abundance and damage. Birds, predatory bugs, lacewing larvae, and spiders prey on the caterpillars. A granulosis virus often infects and kills larvae when they become abundant. Parasitic wasps, especially Trichogramma egg parasites and three larval parasites (Braconidae), are the most important natural enemies of omnivorous looper. Apanteles caberatae and Meteorus tersus feed as a single wasp larva inside a looper larva, then emerge to pupate near the caterpillar. Apanteles caberatae pupates in an elongated, whitish, silken cocoon attached to foliage near its dead host. Meteorus tersus pupates in a brown or yellowish, parchmentlike cocoon that sometimes hangs beneath leaves or twigs, suspended on a silken thread about 1 to 2 inches long. Habrobracon (=Bracon) xanthonotus females lay from one egg to several dozen whitish eggs on each caterpillar. The emerging larvae feed as pale greenish to yellow maggots attached to the looper. Controls include thoroughly spraying infested foliage with Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt). Spraying spinosad is also effective, but can adversely affect certain natural enemies. Spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, so do not apply it to plants that are flowering.",

Some predators and many parasites are quite specialized and confine their feeding to only one or a few closely related species, whereas a general predator feeds on a wide variety of prey. Trichogramma and Apanteles parasites can help control looper populations. General predators are very important in gardens and small farms with a diversity of crops and potential pests. Because they subsist on a variety of insects and mites, general predators will often be present in the garden before serious pests arrive and will be able to provide immediate assistance in their control. Some of the most common general predators are green lacewings, damsel bugs, assassin bugs, bigeyed bugs, minute pirate bugs, soldier beetles, ground beetles, and spiders.",

A. harrisinae is a parasitic wasp that attacks early larval instars and usually deposits three to nine eggs in a host. Fully grown parasite larvae emerge from the fully grown host larva immediately after it has spun its cocoon. The cocoons are spun within the cocoon of the host, surrounding the dead caterpillar. The parasitic fly, A. misella, prefers to attack fourth and fifth instars. Larviposition occurs during the middle of the day and larvae immediately penetrate the host. Little development occurs until the host larva turns into the pupal stage. The parasite larva then develops rapidly and soon kills the host pupa. Its puparium is always formed within the host cocoon.",

    "description": "Leafrollers are larvae (caterpillars) of certain moths (Tortricidae). They primarily chew foliage and often feed and pupate within leaves they curl and web with silk.",
    "identification": "Correctly identify the cause of damage before taking action. The biology and management of leafrollers differs from that of the other caterpillarlike larvae. Grasshoppers, katydids, leaf beetles, sawflies, walking stick insects, weevils, and certain other insects can cause damage resembling caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. About 100 species of leafrollers occur in California. Pests of fruit and nut trees and various ornamental include fruittree leafroller, light brown apple moth, obliquebanded leafroller, and omnivorous leafroller. Adults and larvae of many species are similar looking and for positive identification must be submitted to an expert. Distinguishing leafroller species may be possible based on differences in body color and markings. Adults (moths) of most leafroller species are a mottled mix of colors and at rest appear bell shaped when viewed from above. Larvae have pairs of leglike appendages (prolegs) on abdominal segments 3 through 6 and the last (rear) segment. When disturbed, larvae wriggle vigorously and often drop suspended on on a silk thread.",
    "life_cycle": "Larvae develop through five or six increasingly larger instars (immature growth stages). Older caterpillars construct a new leafroll nest frequently, often daily, eventually pupating inside a nest or on bark in a thin, silken cocoon. Adult females lay eggs overlapping in flat masses resembling fish scales on leaves and limbs. The fruittree leafroller has only one generation per year, and the larvae are present only during spring; it overwinters as eggs on bark. Most other leafroller species have two or more generations per year, and can be present as larvae throughout the growing season; they overwinter in protected places, primarily as larvae or prepupae (inactive, mature larvae).",
    "damage": "Leafroller feeding gives foliage a ragged or curled appearance. Larvae prefer leaves but sometimes chew blossoms, fruits, and nuts, causing them to drop or become distorted or scarred. Unusually high populations can completely defoliate trees, and the leafroller's silken threads can entirely cover the plant.",
    "solutions": "For the major pests, species-specific pheromone-baited traps can be used to determine whether adults of a particular species are present and to time insecticide applications targeting young larvae. Adult captures coincide with egg laying and the approximate time of egg hatching for most species except fruittree leafroller. Conserve natural enemies, which often keep leafroller populations low. Parasitic wasps and tachinid flies are especially common in leafroller larvae and pupae. Trichogramma parasites kill some eggs. Assassin bugs, green lacewing larvae, ground beetles, and certain other beetles and spiders are common predators of leafrollers. Otherwise healthy trees tolerate the loss of some leaves, and low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. If fruittree leafroller has been a problem, apply horticultural oil in January or February to thoroughly cover limbs and small twigs infested with overwintering eggs. Because oil spray can damage dormant plum and walnut trees, spray infested foliage on these hosts during the growing season if leafrollers are a problem. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae). A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. If larger larvae in rolled leaves are abundant, use a high-pressure sprayer so the insecticide penetrates into rolled foliage. Because fruittree leafroller has only one generation per year, by the time chewed leaves are obvious or trees are defoliated, the caterpillar stage might be almost completed and spraying leaves may be of little benefit. For more information, consult Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees.",

    "description": "The beetle (Scarabaeidae) is an occasional pest of apricots, figs, peaches, and plums. Adults can fly a relatively long distance and are highly attracted to ripe fruit and the odors of fermentation and manure.",
    "identification": "The adult is a large, metallic green beetle up to 1-1/3 inches long. Its body is scarab-shaped with prominent legs and antennae that are clubbed (have multiple plates, or lamellae) at the tip. The grublike green fruit beetle larvae are dirty white or brownish and grow up to 2 inches long. Green fruit beetle is sometimes mistaken for the Japanese beetle, Popillia japonica, which is less than one-half as long. Japanese beetle is a serious pest in the eastern United States, but is not established in California.",
    "life_cycle": "Green fruit beetle adults mate and females lay oval, white eggs in the soil just beneath organic matter. Eggs hatch into larvae about 1 week later. During spring, larvae mature and pupate in a cell of soil particles. Adults can be present from late spring through early fall. Green fruit beetle has one generation per year, spent mostly within the larval stage.",
    "damage": "Adult beetles chew maturing soft fruit. The grubs (larvae) do not damage fruit. They burrow and feed in piles of compost, manure, and other decomposing organic matter.",
    "solutions": "To help avoid this beetle's damage, consider planting cultivars that ripen early instead of those that ripen late. Additionally, harvest fruit early and dispose of fallen fruit. Insecticides are of little value against this occasional pest. To prevent feeding by beetles, manage the grubs. Thinly spread or remove all piles of manure, lawn clippings, and leaves near fruit trees. To exclude beetles, compost within screened bins or turn compost piles frequently to speed decomposition and to expose grubs, which you can crush or leave to be eaten by birds. Although managing compost and similar organic matter is more effective at reducing green fruit beetle populations, adults may be captured using homemade traps. Attract adults with a 1:1 mixture of grape or peach juice and water. Place several inches of this liquid bait in a 1 gallon container and in the opening insert a funnel of wire mesh with its widest opening facing up. Beetles attracted by the bait will land in the funnel and be guided to walk down into the container. Once inside, adults will be unable to escape.",

Many are deposited against the leaf veins on the underside of the leaf. After hatching, larvae feed between two webbed leaves for about 2 weeks. Then each pale green larva rolls a leaf edge and feeds from the inside on the leaf edge. Larvae turn darker green as a result of this leaf feeding. If disturbed, larvae wriggle vigorously and drop to the ground without a silken thread. Mature larvae construct a separate leaf envelope on the edge of a leaf in which they pupate.",

    "description": "Larvae (caterpillars) of this moth (Erebidae: Arctiinae) make prominent, silk tents on shoot terminals. The caterpillars can feed on more than 100 species of woody broadleaves, including birch, cottonwood, elm, fruit and nut trees, liquidambar, maple, mulberry, poplar, sycamore, and willow. Identification Larvae of various species are called webworms because of the profuse, silk webbing they excrete on foliage where they feed. Fall webworm, mimosa webworm, and others typically occur in webbed colonies on leaves and twigs at the terminal (outer tip) of branches. This helps to distinguish them from tent caterpillars, which usually web inner foliage around the juncture (crotch) of branches. Fall webworm larvae grow up to 1 inch long and vary greatly in color. In California, they commonly are gray, orangish, or yellowish brown and have black, orange, or white hairs arising from black or orange projections (tubercles) along the body. The adult (moth) has a wingspan of about 1-1/2 inches and a hairy body that is white on top. The forewings are all white or white with brown or black spots. The hind wings (hidden when at rest) and abdomen are orangish. Life cycle Adult moths emerge in the late spring or early summer. In June or July the females lay globular, white or yellow eggs in large masses on host foliage. About 1 week after they are laid, eggs hatch and the larvae feed in groups as they form and gradually enlarge silken tents during summer through early fall. Fall webworms overwinter in dark-brown to reddish cocoons on the host bark or the ground. In California there are one or two generations per year. Damage From July to September, fall webworm caterpillars eat leaves (except not the veins) and form silken tents on host trees. The caterpillars do not feed on fruit or nuts, but these may become sunburned and drop prematurely if defoliation is severe. Yield quantity may be reduced the season after fruit or nut trees are extensively defoliated. Solutions Regularly inspect hosts for silken tents during the summer. On small trees, cut out and destroy infested twigs (e.g., use a pole saw, a blade on the end of a telescoping pole). Alternatively, remove webworm tents and the caterpillars inside by twirling or scrubbing the webbing into a ball using a toilet brush or similar tool attached to a telescoping pole, then dispose of or crush the larvae. If nests are abundant and cannot be pruned off or tolerated, apply Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad with a high-pressure sprayer to penetrate webbed foliage. The addition of a wetting agent to increase penetration of webbing by the insecticide enhances control. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only butterfly and moth larvae that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Using this selective insecticide avoids adversely affecting the parasitic tachinid flies and wasps that kill webworm larvae and pupae and Trichogramma wasps that parasitize the eggs. The somewhat-selective spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because spinosad is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply it to plants that are flowering. If caterpillar-infested trees are large or tall, hiring a pest control company with the equipment and experience to effectively spray trees can be a good idea. Discuss in advance with the company how they plan to control your pest problem. Request they apply caterpillar-selective Bt, or spinosad if the plants to be sprayed are not blossoming.

    "description": "Apple maggot is native to the northeastern United States and Canada. It was not discovered attacking apples until about 100 years after trees were introduced from Europe. It is now considered a major pest of apples in several apple-growing regions because it directly damages the fruit. Apple maggot is currently established only in northern California from Sonoma County north. It is established in Del Norte, Siskiyou, Humbolt, Trinity, Shasta, and Sonoma counties in California. Please report sightings in other counties to your county agricultural commissioners.",
    "identification": "Adult maggots have clear wings with black bands, a pronounced white spot on the back of the thorax, and a black abdomen with light crossbands. Females have four crossbands on the abdomen; males have three. Apple maggot is closely related to walnut husk fly and cherry fruit fly. It can be distinguished from these other pests by the banding on its wings.",
    "life_cycle": "Apple maggots overwinter as pupae in the soil. Generally there is one generation a year, although there may be a partial second generation in warm years. Adults emerge in mid-June to early July; emergence usually peaks between mid- and late July and is over by late August. In some places, some of the pupae may remain in the soil and will not emerge until the following year. When flies emerge in summer, they are sexually immature and must feed on honeydew produced by aphids, psyllids, and scales before they are ready to mate. Female flies lay eggs singly under the skin of apples and then mark the apple with a pheromone to keep other females from laying eggs. Females lay about 300 eggs over a 30-day life span. Eggs hatch in 2 to 10 days, depending on temperature. Larvae are cream colored with a blunt posterior and a tapered front end that contains two black mouth hooks. They feed within the apple and pass through three instars before completing developing in 20 to 30 days. Infested fruit fall to the ground; larvae leave the fruit, burrow into the soil, and molt into a fourth instar and then into a pupal stage to overwinter.",
    "damage": "In soft-fleshed apple varieties a small, dark, decayed spot occurs at the oviposition site. In hard-fleshed varieties, the oviposition site results in a dimple. Young larvae tunnel throughout the apple flesh, leaving a small, brown, irregular, threadlike trail. The tunnels enlarge as the larvae grow; eventually decay organisms enter the fruit and cause internal rotting and fruit drop.",
    "solutions": "Sanitation is very important in controlling apple maggot. Clean up fallen fruit and discard. To detect presence of adults, hang yellow sticky traps in trees; traps attract flies in search of food. If you find apple maggot in counties where it has not been reported, contact your local Agricultural Commissioner's Office or UC Cooperative Extension office. Sticky red sphere traps hung in trees can help control maggots. Applications of spinosad made mid-July and repeated every 7 to 10 days if necessary can also help control this pest.",

Before taking control action, distinguish among these pests, such as by using a hand lens to examine the arrangement of small hooks on the bottom of larval prolegs. American plum borer adults are gray moths with brown and black wing markings. Larvae are dull green, pinkish, or white. Both are up to about 1 inch long.",
    "life_cycle": "Beginning in about April, adults emerge, mate, and the female moths lay eggs in bark wounds. The newly hatched larvae immediately enter the wound to chew and feed on the underlying cambium. Larvae develop through several increasingly larger instars. Mature larvae pupate in a silk cocoon in bark crevices or damaged wood in trees. They overwinter as mature larvae in a cocoon within the tree. American plum borer has three to four generations per year.",
    "damage": "Larvae feed in cambium around main branch crotches, the lower trunk, and root crown, causing extensive gumming, reddish orange frass, and webbing. This weakens limbs, which often break during windy conditions, and sometimes kills young trees.",
    "solutions": "Avoid bark wounds; larvae can enter cambium only through relatively fresh bark wounds. Pruning cuts, injuries from sunburn or weed trimmers, and bacterial galls and canker fungi make trees highly susceptible to infestation. Take protective measure, such as whitewashing, or painting lower trunks of young trees with interior white latex diluted with an equal amount of water to prevent sunburn. Where damage is unavoidable or already present, a residual, contact insecticide can be applied from about 1 foot above the main lower branch crotch to the soil line. A professional applicator usually must be hired to apply an effective product and rate for trunk application.",

The virus attacks the gut of the larvae, which results in dark diarrhetic blotches on the leaves. Healthy larvae can become infected by virus particles in the excrement. Other insects distribute the virus when they walk through the diarrhetic blotches. There are four typical symptoms of infection in adults and larvae: 1) eggs are scattered and the number of eggs is reduced, 2) eggs fail to hatch, 3) larvae consume tiny patches of tissue rather than consuming entire areas of the leaf, and 4) larval growth and coloration change and larvae shrink and eventually die.",

    "description": "Shot hole disease affects Prunus spp. Hosts include almonds, Catalina and Japanese flowering cherries, English laurel, ornamental plums, nectarines, peaches, and especially apricot. The disease will develop on cherries, plums, and prunes only when growing near more susceptible hosts during years with unusually wet weather during winter and spring. Identification Shot hole first appears in the spring as purplish or reddish spots about 1/10 inch in diameter on new buds, leaves, and shoots. Spots on young leaves commonly have a narrow, light green or yellow margin. The spots expand and their centers turn brown and can drop out, leaving holes. The fungal disease also causes premature leaf drop, rough and corky or scabby lesions on fruit that are brown with dark purple margins and mostly on the upper surface, and small cankers on branches. Tiny, dark specks (sporodochium and spores) visible with a hand lens form in the centers of brown spots, especially on buds; these dark fungal spores help to distinguish shot hole from other diseases. Life cycle The fungus overwinters in infected buds and twig lesions. The spores spread in splashing water. Disease is most severe following warm, foggy or rainy winters and when it rains in the spring during young leaf growth. Spores that land on twigs, buds, blossoms, or young leaves require 24 hours of continuous wetness to cause infection. Only the current season's growth is susceptible to infection. In California, twig and bud infections of apricot, nectarine, and peach can occur during rainy weather any time between fall and spring. Buds of peach, nectarine, and sometimes apricot are killed in the winter. The fungus can germinate and infect at temperatures as low as 36°F. When zinc sulfate is sprayed on foliage in late October to early November to hasten leaf fall, shot hole inoculum is prevented from increasing. Otherwise, high levels of inoculum may develop and overwinter on the trees, infecting leaves the following spring. Solutions Use low-volume sprinklers, drip irrigation, or sprinkler deflectors and prune off lower branches to prevent foliage wetting from irrigation. Prune and dispose of infected plant tissue as soon as it appears. After leaf drop, inspect plants carefully and prune varnished-appearing (infected) buds and twigs with lesions. Diligent sanitation and directing irrigation water away from foliage provide adequate control where the incidence of shot hole is low. Where disease is severe on high-value plants, Bordeaux mixture, fixed copper, or certain synthetic fungicides such as chlorothalonil can be applied after leaf drop. Retreatment in late winter before buds swell or between full bloom and petal fall or both times may be necessary on highly susceptible apricot or if prolonged wet weather occurs in the spring.",

Eutypa dieback symptoms in spring include stunted shoots and small, chlorotic, distorted leaves, which resemble those of Pierce's disease. Pruning wound cankers, however, are not associated with Pierce's disease as they are with Eutypa dieback. Phylloxera causes a decline of vines; look for phylloxera insects on roots. Oak root fungus can cause wilting, along with discoloration and drying of fruit and foliage, but fungal fans will be evident beneath bark in crown area.",

The blue-green sharpshooter, Graphocephala atropunctata, is the most prevalent in coastal regions such as the Napa Valley. A new large sharpshooter, the glassy-winged sharpshooter was introduced into California in the 1990's. It is now prevalent in southern California and parts of the San Joaquin Valley. It spreads Pierce's disease more effectively than the other sharpshooters. Sharpshooters pick up the bacterium by feeding on symptomless plant hosts as well as infected grapes and transfer it to healthy grapes by feeding. Leaves become scorched and dwarfed, grapes may raisin, and overall vines become stunted and late in growth.",

'Sylvaner', 'Thompson Seedless', and 'Ruby Cabernet' are less susceptible than other varieties. Remove vines as they become unproductive and replant with less susceptible cultivars.

    "description": "The fungus infects pear, certain other Rosaceae plants, and incense cedar. Its other names include cedar broom rust, incense cedar rust, and Pacific coast pear rust. Identification Infected pear and other rose family plants develop discolored spots with dry, powdery or rough, reddish, yellowish, or orange spore masses. Groups of tiny, cup-shaped, spore-forming bodies appear as pustules on fruit, green stems, and leaves. On fruiting pears, infections occur primarily on the fruit. Life cycle Gymnosporangium libocedri alternates between incense cedar and apple, hawthorn, mountain ash, pear, quince, and serviceberry. Spores are produced on incense cedar in the spring and disperse in air to infect the young tissues of pear and the other rosaceous hosts. Wet weather favors rust disease, so infection and damage is more common on rosaceous hosts when it is rainy in the spring. The fungus grows in infected rosaceous hosts and produces airborne spores that infect incense cedar, usually in late summer or fall. Damage Flower petals, fruit, green stems, and leaves can become spotted. Infected fruit become distorted. Fruit and leaves may drop prematurely. Solutions Avoid overhead watering. Dispose of infected fruit, leaves, and shoots as soon as symptoms appear. Fungicides applied in the spring can prevent or reduce rust disease. Because Gymnosporangium damage to fruit is uncommon in California, the applications required to prevent pear rust may not be warranted.

    "identification": "Their small size, enlarged back legs, characteristic shot-hole damage, and habit of jumping when disturbed make flea beetles easy to identify. There are numerous flea beetle species. The tobacco flea beetle, Epitrix hirtipennis, which is brown with black markings across its back, and the western potato flea beetle, E. subcrinita, which is shiny bronze or black, are widespread in the western U.S. The tuber flea beetle, E. tuberis, is found in Washington and Oregon. Other common flea beetles are the western black flea beetle, Phyllotreta pusilla, which is shiny black to dark olive green, and the western striped flea beetle, P. ramosa, which is black with a white or yellow curved stripe along each side of the back. All flea beetles are tiny, less than 1/10 inch long, and jump like fleas when disturbed.",
    "life_cycle": "Adult flea beetles overwinter in weeds or debris and fly into potato-growing areas in spring. Flea beetles lay very small eggs in the soil around the plant, on the leaves, or in cavities hollowed out in the stems. The larvae are small, slender, white, and wormlike and usually attack the roots but may also feed on foliage. Depending on the species, they rarely cause significant damage except on potato tubers, where they create tunnels in the flesh of tubers. The larval stage may last up to a month. Flea beetles pupate in the soil. There are one or two generations a year.",
    "damage": "Adults feed mostly on leaves, leaving tiny pits or small holes at their feeding sites. Flea beetles feeding together can cover leaves with bleached, pitted areas or ragged holes. Damage is not usually serious beyond early seedling stage. On carrots, larvae may cause sunken spots on roots. On eggplants and potato tubers, larvae feed on roots and stems and can create straight, narrow tunnels in tubers providing an entry for fungi. Small raised bumps may be on surface of tubers.",
    "solutions": "Remove debris in the fall to remove any overwintering beetles. Seedlings can be protected with protective coverings until they are in the sixth leaf stage; older plants are less likely to suffer damage. Reflective mulches applied very soon after planting and before plants become infected can be helpful. White sticky traps can be used to monitor or trap adults. Insecticides should not normally be necessary and are not very effective when populations are high. Sulfur containing pesticides may be repellent. Often only a few outside rows will require treatment. Carbaryl sprays can provide some control where infestations are serious.",

    "description": "Because of their relatively large size and unusual appearance, Jerusalem crickets (family Stenopelmatidae) are commonly brought to entomologists for identification. They have many common names, including “niñas de la tierra” (children of the earth) and sand crickets. They also are sometimes called potato bugs because they are occasional pests of potatoes, but the name “potato bug” is confusing because it is applied to several different invertebrates, including Colorado potato beetle, pillbugs, sowbugs, and Jerusalem crickets, none of which are true bugs (Heteroptera). Identification Jerusalem crickets feed and tunnel underground during the day and can occur aboveground mostly at night. They are most often seen when exposed by gardeners turning the soil or above ground after heavy irrigation or rainfall, at night, or at twilight during mild weather. They are easily recognized by their bald, round, humanoid head and fat orangish abdomen with black rings. They have long, brownish antennae and spiny hind legs and lack wings. They grow up to about 2 inches long. Nymphs (immatures) look like small adults. Life cycle Jerusalem crickets hatch from eggs laid in soil and spend much of their time underground. Nymphs molt up to about 10 times before becoming reproductive adults. Their life span can be up to about 2 years. Damage Jerusalem crickets are harmless to people and woody plants. Their food includes insects, nonwoody roots, and tubers. They only occasionally damage turf and vegetables. Aside from their alarming appearance, they generally are not pests. Solutions No control is necessary for Jerusalem crickets. They may be important food for certain vertebrate predators. If found where they are not desired, they can be scooped into a box and thrown away. For more information see Jerusalem Cricket (PDF) from Colorado State University (CSU).

    "description": "Wheat curl mites are microscopic white, wormlike organisms about 1/4 mm long. The legs are very small and located near the head. These mites feed on liliaceous bulbs, cereal grains, and wild grasses.",
    "identification": "",
    "life_cycle": "",
    "damage": "This mite is primarily a pest of stored bulbs; its feeding causes stored onions and garlic to desiccate. Wheat curl mite is a vector of rot-causing organisms in both the garden and storage. Heavy infestations result in streaking and twisting of garlic leaves and reduce plant stand as well as yield.",
    "solutions": "Gardens rotated into onions or garlic from corn may have higher levels of wheat curl mites. Flood irrigation or heavy winter rains may reduce populations. Avoid planting successive onion or garlic crops.",

    "description": "Adult beetles are shiny with black heads, long antennae, and about 1/4 inch long. Larvae are whitish and slender with three pairs of short legs; the head and tip of the abdomen are darker. Adults may be striped or spotted, depending upon species.",
    "identification": "Cucumber beetles are very common pests in vegetable gardens and may also attack ripening stone fruit. The most abundant species in California is the western spotted cucumber beetle, Diabrotica undecimpunctata; however, the similar western striped cucumber beetle, Acalymma trivittata, may also cause damage. The western spotted cucumber beetle is greenish yellow and has twelve black spots on its back; the western striped cucumber beetle is yellowish orange and has three black stripes. Cucumber beetles may sometimes be confused with predaceous lady beetles, but can be distinguished by the antennae. Lady beetle antennae are short and stubby; those of cucumber beetles are long and threadlike. Larvae of the spotted cucumber beetle feed on the roots of corn, small grains, beans, sweet pea, and several grasses but do not usually cause noticeable damage in gardens. The striped cucumber beetle larva feeds exclusively on cucurbit roots and can damage these crops when infestations are heavy.",
    "life_cycle": "Beetles overwinter as adults in weedy areas and move into planted fields and gardens as soon as plants start to come up. They lay their yellow orange eggs at the base of plants or in soil cracks. Hatching larvae burrow into the ground seeking out roots, feed for 2 to 6 weeks, pupate, and emerge as adult beetles that attack the aboveground portions of the plant. There are several generations a year.",
    "damage": "Adults feed on the leaves of many vegetables as well as on soft fruit. Shoots and blossoms may also be consumed. Cucumber beetles may also spread cucumber mosaic virus or wilts in cucurbits. Larvae feed exclusively on roots, but do not generally damage garden plants, although corn may occasionally be damaged.",
    "solutions": "Management of cucumber beetles is difficult. Most older plants can support substantial numbers without serious damage. The best strategy for most vegetable gardens may be to place protective cloth over emerging plants and remove it when plants are old enough to tolerate damage. On stone-fruit trees, early harvest may be the only option. Various general predators are known to attack cucumber beetles.",

Common hosts: Armyworms, cabbage looper, tomato fruitworm, and tussock moth, and other caterpillars in many other crops. The adult wasp is black with lighter colored abdomen and legs, and is 0.25 to 0.50 inch (6-12 mm) long. The larva is a light, translucent green. Hyposoter exiguae undergoes complete metamorphosis. The adult wasp lays its egg in the caterpillar. After hatching, the larva develops within the caterpillar, and the host caterpillar shrinks and becomes hard and brittle. The parasite then spins a cocoon inside the larval skin, or the caterpillar skin splits and the parasite emerges and pupates outside the host. Parasite development time from oviposition until adult emergence is about 1 month. Look for the white speckled Hyposoter cocoons on leaves in the field. To find a parasitized larva look for a pale-green parasite inside. This is done by pulling either end of the caterpillar and allowing the wasp larva to pop out. Hyposoter exiguae is one of at least 27 Hyposoter spp. in the United States, which attack dozens of different caterpillars.",

    "description": "On vegetables, the most common leafminers are the larvae of small flies belonging to the genus Liriomyza, including the vegetable leafminer (L. sativae), serpentine leafminer (L. trifolii), and the pea leafminer (L. langei).",
    "identification": "Adult leafminers are small, active, black flies often with a prominent yellow triangle between the bases of the wings. The head behind the eyes is mostly black. Other species may have the thorax covered with overlapping bristles that give fresh specimens a silvery gray color with the area behind the eyes yellow. Larvae are yellow cylindrical maggots that feed beneath the leaf surface. The yellowish maggots and brown, seedlike pupae of the two species are too similar to distinguish.",
    "life_cycle": "In warm weather, leafminers may be more active. The life cycle is only 2 weeks long. Eggs are inserted into leaves and larvae feed between leaf surfaces, creating a \"mine.\" At high population levels, entire leaves may be covered with mines. Mature larvae leave the mines, dropping to the ground to pupate. There can be five to ten generations per year. Development continues all year, the population moving from one host to another as new host plants become available each season.",
    "damage": "Leafminers attack many different vegetable and flower hosts, including cole crops, cucurbits, tomatoes, peas, beans, aster, begonia, dahlia, impatiens, lily, marigold, petunia, and verbena. Adult female leafminers puncture leaves and sometimes petals to feed on exuding sap. These punctures eventually turn white, giving foliage a stippled or speckled appearance. The most obvious evidence of leafminers is the twisting trails (or mines) the larvae leave as they feed beneath the leaf surface. The mine becomes longer and wider as the larva grows. Mining usually has little impact on plant growth and rarely kills plants. Unusually heavy damage can slow plant growth and may cause infested leaves to drop. Damage will not be serious on most plants older than seedlings, although it may make spinach or chard unsightly.",
    "solutions": "Leafminers rarely require treatment in gardens. Provide proper care, especially irrigation to keep plants vigorous. Clip off and remove older infested leaves. Plant resistant species or varieties. Small seedlings can be protected by protective cloth. On plants such as cole crops, lettuce, and spinach, clip off and remove older infested leaves. Leafminers are often kept under good control by natural parasites. Insecticides are not very effective for leafminer control.",

Later instars, the stages most often found in fruit, are usually gray or yellowish with an irregular band of red or purple across each segment. The slender, brown pupa is usually enclosed in a loose silk cocoon with adhering soil or plant debris. Adult moths are light gray, peppered with small black flecks, and can be confused with the potato tuberworm. Don't confuse leaf damage with mining of leafminers, which is narrow and meandering, with a dark line of feces threaded through it. Leafminers never fold leaves.",
    "life_cycle": "Eggs are laid on lower surfaces of leaves. Larvae usually begin to feed in leaf mines before moving to fruit. Larvae may complete development in leaf shelters, or they may leave to enter fruit, later pupating on the ground or in soil. Adults, which emerge from pupae after a few days, are active mostly at night. Mating occurs soon after emergence and females lay most of their eggs within 2 days. There can be as many as seven or eight overlapping generations per year; the life cycle takes less than a month in summer, but may take 3 to 4 months in winter. In mild winters, development continues as long as host plants are available; there is no diapause.",
    "damage": "Pinworms cause leaf mines and folded shelters on leaves. They bore into fruit at the stem ends, creating narrow, blackened tunnels. Damage is hard to detect at first, but after larvae have been feeding for some time, a brown, granular frass usually appears at the edge of the calyx.",

After the first molt, larvae start tunneling into the leaf stalk. Some larvae may move toward the leaf petiole or toward the buds and mine the outer bracts. With each subsequent molt, the larvae work their way toward the center of the bud. Larvae undergo four to five instars.

Family: Trichogrammatidae. Common hosts: Eggs of hundreds of species of insects, especially moths, butterflies, and sawflies. Especially important in management of codling moth and fruitworm. A few species parasitize eggs of beetles, flies, true bugs, other wasps, and lacewings. Adults are approximately 1/25 inch (1 mm) or less—the size of a period at the end of a sentence. They often have wing hairs (setae) arranged in rows. Their body is relatively compact and the antennae are short. Trichogramma species are difficult to identify due to their minute size and generally uniform morphological features. Trichogramma spp. undergo complete metamorphosis. The adult wasp lays an egg within a recently laid host egg, and as the wasp larva develops, it eats the host embryo, causing the egg to turn black. Because their life cycle from egg to adult is about 7 to 10 days, these parasites have many more generations than their hosts, and their populations can increase rapidly. Trichogramma turns the eggs of some caterpillar species black. This is the best way to detect parasitization by Trichogramma.",

Various other insects can cause damage that resembles caterpillar chewing, but these other insects do not produce silk strands or webbing. Other leafroller species may occur on the same plant. Omnivorous leafroller larvae have a brown to cream-colored or greenish-brown body up to 3/5 inch long. Larvae have a black or brown head and prothoracic shield, the area just behind the head and on the top and sides of the first abdominal segment. Through the translucent cuticle (outer covering) the main blood vessel running along the back is often visible as a faint dark stripe. The mounds (tubercles) at the base of the bristles along the top and sides are chalky white. Adults are small, dark-brown moths up to 1/2 inch long with a dark band on the wing and a distinct snout. At rest adults appear bell shaped, as do those of other tortricid species.",

    "damage": "Omnivorous leafroller feeds on many hosts, including caneberries, fruit and nut trees, grapes, and various ornamentals and weeds. When they feed between leaves and fruit, they can cause substantial fruit scarring.",
    "solutions": "Conserve natural enemies, which often keep leafroller populations low. Parasitic wasps and tachinid flies are especially common in leafroller larvae and pupae. Trichogramma parasites kill some eggs. Assassin bugs, green lacewing larvae, ground beetles and certain other beetles, and spiders are common predators. Clean up gardens by removing weeds that can be alternate hosts of leafroller larvae. Eliminate plant debris that can harbor pupae. Hand removal of webbed leaves and larvae can help control leafrollers on small plants. Otherwise healthy plants tolerate the loss of some leaves. Low numbers of leafrollers do not warrant insecticide application. A properly timed foliar spray of Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) or spinosad controls leafroller larvae. Bacillus thuringiensis kills only caterpillars (butterfly and moth larvae) that feed on sprayed foliage. A second application of Bt about 7 to 10 days after the first is recommended because of its short persistence. Spinosad can adversely affect bees and certain natural enemies. Because it is toxic to bees for several hours after the spray has dried, do not apply spinosad to plants that are flowering. Pest Notes: Leafrollers on Ornamental and Fruit Trees",

    "description": "The corn earworm or tomato fruitworm is a common caterpillar pest of many vegetables and flowers. Newly hatched larvae have several rows of dark bristles on their backs. Older larvae are striped but their body color varies from green or yellow to brown and is not reliable for identification. Many short, whiskerlike spines cover the body surface. Identification of species",
    "identification": "",
    "life_cycle": "Early plants are not as seriously damaged by earworms as are those planted for a later harvest. Female moths are attracted to plants in flowering and fruiting stages. They place eggs in a specific position. When available, corn silks are one of the earworm's preferred egg-laying sites; fresh silks are favored over older ones. On tomatoes, eggs are laid on terminal leaflets; in lettuce, a preferred site is the crowns of young seedlings. Eggs are spherical and are laid singly. Newly laid eggs are white, but they develop a reddish brown ring after about 24 hours. Larvae feed on fruit and leaves and drop to the soil to pupate. There are three or four generations per year.",
    "damage": "Earworms feed on leaves, buds, and flowers of many vegetable crops. They destroy seedlings, bore into lettuce heads and bean pods, make deep watery cavities in fruit, and leave frass. On corn, larvae eat through kernels of ears and feed on the developing tassels in the whorls of the plant. Damage is usually limited to the first 2 to 3 inches of the ear.",
    "solutions": "On corn: Early planted corn is not as seriously affected as is late corn. Consider not treating, and simply cutting off damaged ends of corn at harvest. Applying a few drops of mineral oil with a medicine dropper to silks just inside each ear 3 to 5 days after silks first appear may be effective. Applications of insecticides, such as spinosad must be applied on silks within 3 days after first silks appear and at 3-day intervals until silks turn brown. Bacillus thuringiensis, a biological insecticide, may be dusted on silks every 3 days after 5 to 10% silk formation for partial control. Destroy culls and plants immediately after harvest. On other vegetable crops and fruit: Handpick. Avoid spraying with insecticides. Bacillus thuringiensis, may kill 40 to 60% of the population but must be applied just after eggs hatch and before caterpillars enter fruit. Spinosad may also be effective. Plant early and harvest before late August. Disc or rototill plants immediately after harvest to reduce overwintering populations and prevent migration to neighboring crops. Important natural enemies of the earworms include Hyposoter and Trichogramma parasites. General predators also feed on eggs and larvae.",

Plant growth may be reduced and bulbs may rot in storage or in the field. They thrive in association with bulb and root diseases. Infested fleshy bulb scales commonly turn reddish brown. Bulb mite-infested roots, rhizomes, or basal stems can become soft and decayed. On seeded onions, mites can cut off the radicle before the plant becomes established. On spinach, bulb mites penetrate the developing leaves and distort the growth.",
    "solutions": "Inspect bulbs carefully before planting for signs of bulb mites, and destroy any that are infested, decayed, or are soft when squeezed. Avoid injuring bulbs during digging, handling or storage. Injuries promote attack by diseases and mites. If storing bulbs, examine them carefully for signs of mites and disease. Rapid crop rotation fosters the survival of mites on leftover vegetation. After harvest, clear all vegetation to allow organic matter to decompose; this reduces populations of the mite.

    "description": "Plants affected by white mold generally show white, cottony mycelium on the surface of the infected area. On or inside the white mycelium appear black, round to irregular-shaped structures called sclerotia. On flowering plants such as tomatoes or cucurbits, symptoms include water-soaked areas on flowers and at stem joints where senescent flower petals have fallen. The infection quickly kills stems, which eventually dry and take on a bleached appearance. Water-soaked stem lesions may also appear at the soil line if senescent plant debris is present around the plant. Infected fruits turn gray and rot. On carrots, white mold, sometimes known as cottony soft rot, may occur at any stage of growth. Extensive root decay may occur before symptoms of wilt appear on the upper part of the plant.",
    "identification": "",
    "life_cycle": "Sclerotia survive in the soil. When they are within the top 2 to 3 cm of soil they can germinate to form a saucer-shaped fruiting body called an apothecium. Each apothecium produces millions of spores, which are disseminated by wind. Both infection and subsequent spread of white mold are determined by temperature and moisture. White mold is favored by cool, moist conditions. Spores germinate on and colonize dead or senescent tissue; senescent flowers are frequently the source of new infections.",
    "damage": "",
    "solutions": "White mold is favored by a wet soil surface and high temperatures. Avoid planting in infested soil. Use of raised beds and careful furrow irrigation that does not overflow onto bed surfaces can help limit damage. Avoid overhead sprinklers. Space plants well enough to allow good air circulation. Remove and destroy entire infected plants and crop residues as soon as you see the mold. Bury old plant debris to help destroy sclerotia.",

Cut affected plants at the base of stems and examine them in cross section to see the browning of the water-conducting tissue compared to the healthy ivory of uninfected plants. Verticillium and Fusarium discoloration are extremely difficult to distinguish, although Fusarium discoloration tends to be darker. Fusarium tends to occur more in warmer soils and Verticillium in cooler ones. Management for both requires resistant varieties.",

Because spores cannot germinate when there is free moisture and may be killed, plantings with overhead sprinkler systems or frequent water sprays may have reduced incidence of powdery mildew. Where conditions are most favorable for mildew, you may consider application of fungicides such as highly refined oils, sulfur soaps, or biologicals. Compost or bury infected residues to destroy overwintering fungus. For more information, see the Powdery Mildew Pest Note.",

E. cichoracearum can, however, be common in areas with cool springs and summers. All cucurbits are susceptible to powdery mildew, but the disease is less common on watermelon than on other cucurbits. Powdery mildew first appears as pale yellow spots on stems, petioles, and leaves. These spots enlarge as the white, fluffy mycelium grows over plant surfaces and produces spores, which give the lesions a powdery appearance. Affected leaves become dull, chlorotic, and may wilt in the afternoon heat; eventually they become brown and papery. Plants may die.",

Spores, which are the primary means of dispersal, make up the bulk of the powdery growth and are produced in chains that can be seen with a hand lens. Spores are carried by the wind to new hosts. All powdery mildew species can germinate and infect in the absence of water. Moderate temperatures and shady conditions are generally the most favorable for development. Spores are sensitive to extreme heat and direct sunlight.",

The ring rot bacterium is a vascular parasite and moves up in the water-conducting tissues and produces toxins that cause foliar symptoms. Rosetting and other early symptoms of dwarfing occur when bacteria proliferate in very young stems of certain varieties.
