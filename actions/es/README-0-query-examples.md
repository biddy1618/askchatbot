- [In spite of putting tape around our screen, we had hundreds of these small black bugs swarm our bedroom last night while we were reading. They came from outside (they were on the screen) and were attracted to the light. They are completely squishable, can hop AND fly, and are about 1/8". They don't bite. We think they may be in the trees or on the roof directly above our upper level bedroom, as there weren't any in our den during the evening, which is a level down and directly below our room, with even bigger windows. We are in Excelsior. Help!](https://ask2.extension.org/kb/faq.php?id=413736)
