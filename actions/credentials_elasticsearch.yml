# The value of 'host' depends on the elasticsearch deployment:
#
# - When Elasticsearch is deployed on the same computer with docker-compose:
#   host = IPv4 Internal, which you get with `hostname -I`
#
# - When Elasticsearch is deployed on another computer:
#   host = IPv4 External or Domain Name of that other computer
#
hosts:
    - host: 192.168.1.6
      port: 9200
