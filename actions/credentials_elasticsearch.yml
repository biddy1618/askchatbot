# list of hosts for Elasticsearch
# https://elasticsearch-py.readthedocs.io/en/master/api.html#elasticsearch'
#
# The value of 'host' depends on the elasticsearch deployment:
#
# - When Elasticsearch is deployed on the same computer with docker-compose:
#   host = IPv4 Internal, which you get with `hostname -I`
#
# - When Elasticsearch is deployed on another computer:
#   host = IPv4 External or Domain Name of that other computer
#
# Notes:
#  - arjaan-Kudu : IPv4 = 192.168.1.6 (home); 10.184.186.1 (phone)
#  - ec2 askchatbot instance   : IPv4 = 10.1.100.167
#  - ec2 elasticsearch instance: See /etc/hosts
#hosts: "https://ask-chat-db-dev.i.eduworks.com:9200/"
hosts:
    - host: 192.168.1.6
      port: 9200
