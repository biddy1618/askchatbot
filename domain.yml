  utter_explain_ipm:
  - text: IPM is an ecosystem-based strategy that focuses on long-term prevention 
         of pests or their damage through a combination of techniques such as 
         biological control, habitat manipulation, modification of cultural 
         practices, and use of resistant varieties. 
         
         Pesticides are used only after monitoring indicates they are needed 
         according to established guidelines, and treatments are made with the 
         goal of removing only the target organism. 
         
         Pest control materials are selected and applied in a manner that 
         minimizes risks to human health, beneficial and nontarget organisms, 
         and the environment.
